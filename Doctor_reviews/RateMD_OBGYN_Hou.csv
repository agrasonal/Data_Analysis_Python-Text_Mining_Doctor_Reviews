I know I am not an easy patient but he always takes his time and answer all the questions with his high skills. His nurses and staff are great too. He is always very kind, polite , comforting, and has a great sense of humor. He takes his time with you and does not rush you and makes sure he answers all your questions. His surgery skills are very good too. I highly recommend him to everyone."

MacCato,Houston,Texas,Gynecologist (OBGYN), Male,32,4.98,2016-07-25T19:33:09.130Z,5,5,5,5,5,"We found Dr. Maccato after a miscarriage and he walked us through it with laughter and kindness. There is office so helpful, responsive, and professional. Not too mention that will fit you in same day if need be. They truly do care about you. We welcomed our first baby boy a year ago and when I could not breast feed, Dr. Maccato may me feel good when he said ""that's why God invented formula."" He will take all the time you need and answer every question."

I found him through a friend with my second baby and I honestly couldn't say enough great things about him! As far and the staff, they were AMAZING! I never waited more than 5-10 minutes in the waiting room as they are really on top of their scheduling game. I usually never spent more than 45 min for my entire appointment there which was great because with my first I had to clear half of my day. The actual delivery was great as well. I was freaking out because I had a scheduled c-section and my first was very traumatizing for me. He assured me that everything would be fine and his calmness rubbed off onto me. He talked to me in surgery as he went along asking if I was ok. It wasn't a quick in and out with him...he actually cared about my well being. After I delivered I was surprised to see him come check on me, with my first, my doctor sent her Nurse Practitioner. As a matter of fact, the night I went into labor she wasn't ""on call"" and I ended up delivering with another doctor. He seen me when something was wrong and never seemed bothered that I bothered him. He even offered me stay an extra night at the hospital since the day I was scheduled to go home it iced over in Houston. He is a doctor who genuinely cares and he surely deserves to be #1 in Houston!"

Words cannot describe how satisfied I was with my experience using him during my pregnancy with my daughter! I actually decided to use him after seeing reviews on this website! He was very respectful of my birth plan. He respected how important it was to me not to have a C-Section when my baby was breech toward the end of my 9th month he helped make sure I had a vaginal delivery. The office staff is super friendly which is important to me. If I like a doctor but there is a mean secretary it makes the visit unfriendly. Everyone there is amazing. Also, not long wait time AT ALL. Everything about him and is practice is awesome. He is so sweet and respectful. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"

I know that he wasn't happy about missing it. Even though he clearly didn't feel well yet from his surgery, he was there in the operating room standing there by my side the whole time talking me through every step and at a point when I reached out he held my hand to show support.

I had bad experience after he removed my fibroids in July 2017. When i decided to do the surgery, i saw different doctors he was my 4 opinions and he promised me that i will do a good job trust me. According to his review , i finally let him do my myomectomy that was a big mistake. This doctor is graduated in China, he's not recognized as tops gynecologists doctors in Texas, i knew that after the operation and it was too late .After 3 months of my surgery i had abdominal pain . When i saw another doctor for ultrasound, he realized that the doctor close my pelvic with severe adhesions and my uterus will not be able to carry pregnancy. Now I'm suffering, i went back to see him . He told that my case is so severe , he cannot fix the problem and i need a good surgeon for this case. All his reviews are fake, i will not recommend anyone to see this doctor. He's on of the worse surgeon in Texas. i never write review in my entire life but i want to search my bad experience with this doctor. "

He takes the time to listen to questions, concerns, he is extremely knowledgeable and he is clearly very energetic and and enthusiastic about what he does. I had a laparoscopic myomectomy and I am a little after week 3 now. Virtually invisible scar and the healing process has been lovely and smooth. It is kind of hard to believe that I actually had a surgery! I will admit I was nervous at first, but all of the people kept telling me that I was in good hands, and they were absolutely correct! I had been to many doctors before for my fibroids, and none of them seemed up to tackle the issue as readily as Dr. Guan was. I am so grateful for him and his amazing staff !"

He was responsive, thorough, professional, detailed, communicative, and very good in surgery. In addition, he is excellent with patient care and follow-up post uterine fibroid removal and in the several week later follow-up meeting. Dr. Guan did an amazing job with, in my case, a very very very large uterine fibroid with excellent results...No SCAR!!! It was all though the belly button...amazing! He developed this unique technique which also greatly reduces pain and makes recovery faster and better. I was walking right away after the unique laparoscopic hysterectomy. As Dr. Guan said, post surgery, one still must let the body recover for several weeks and I am following his advice to the letter. I am 4 weeks out and feeling great, working but not lifting and taking it easy. Along the journey since the surgery, I have been able to loose 10 pounds and counting! Life returned to almost normal as I started eating meals right away and taking showers. I cannot say enough positive things about Dr. Guan and his OBGYN abilities and in particular his ability to tackle fibroids. My case was a bit complicated because of the extremely large size of the fibroid, but the procedure was exceedingly successful. A big thank you to Dr. Guan!!! I am pleased to recommend Dr. Xiaoming Guan. Five stars, indeed!!!"

Due to heavy bleeding and abdomen pain during the periods, I had traditional myomectomy 5 years ago by my previous OG doctor. While it recurred 3 years ago, with even more bleeding, more pain and sever anemia. Fortunately, 3 moths ago, my friend recommended Dr. Guan to me.
Dr. Guan is a talented, professional, and an experienced doctor. He is very nice and patient when listening to me and answering all of my questions, explaining all medical terms to make sure I understand. After the visit to Dr. Guan, I decided to have laparoscopic hysterectomy by him. It has been approved that I made a wise decision.
Dr. Guan performed laparoscopic hysterectomy for me 20 days ago. Compared to my previous myomectomy surgery by another doctor, laparoscopic hysterectomy preformed by Dr. Guan is definitely an experience with less-pain and a quick-recovery: I was able to get up from the bed easily without anyone's help 4 hours after the surgery and walk around without any severe pain the same day after the surgery. I got back home and had normal meals the same day as well. I was able to have a shower the very next day. Dr. Guan even called me and asked for my feelings. His great caring manner and tremendous skills make him one of the top doctors I've ever known. Dr. Guan is really a life saver. I strongly recommend him to whoever is suffering from a similar situation while being eager to have a much better quality of life, like myself!"

The Friday before my appt I received a call from Janice telling me she needed my records and asked if I could drop them off at the office on Monday. No problem. She said Dr. Ronen would need to review them before accepting me. I fought the urge to panic and did exactly as she asked. Monday afternoon at 5:30pm I received a call from Janice saying Dr. Ronen would not accept me as I am ""high risk"". My appt, which I've had scheduled for over a month, was canceled less than 24 hours beforehand!!! I'm pregnant with twins in a new city!!!! I was FURIOUS. I proceed to tell Janice that this is extremely unprofessional. And she gave me EXCUSES. Not an I'm sorry!!!! She said ""well, he needed to review your records and you only just got them to us today."" To which I advised her, YOU ONLY ASKED FOR THEM ON FRIDAY. I told her they had a month for figure this out!!! And I could've easily gotten my records to them earlier if they had asked!! She said ""well, you're out of state"" Ummm, I am an RN. You can sign a release of information and get your records sent pretty much anywhere. To be fair, she called the next day offering to fax my records to the MD of my choice (without a release I should add. Which I believe is a HIPPA violation).
I do appreciate that Dr. Ronen did not accept me knowing that his skills and expertise are not up to par. I am grateful to have found this out now and can go to a doctor who can safely take care of me and my babies. So beware Mama's who are moving to Houston after 20 weeks pregnant!!"

Staff was so friendly. Office was clean, peaceful,and technologically advanced! (loved how they had a tv in the waiting area, then tvs in the exam rooms so I could continue to watch the movie while I Waited!) Dr. Ronen was very supportive of me, and came up with a plan for my fertility. This clinic was efficient and I look forward to being a patient of his for a long time!

My first ever pregnancy ended with a miscarriage in first trimester, the doctor and his staff were very cold and didn't show any sympathy. His staff are very rude and unprofessional. I am always hearing other patients private medical issues being spread along staff member, they are definately not discreet.

I first met him when I had my first pregnancy but i miscarried. A year later I was pregnant again and he has delivered 2 of my 3 kids. The only reason why he didn't deliver my 3rd child is because I was a high risk pregnancy and he referred me to another Dr. That was a hard adjustment for me because I am so used to him. But immediately after I had my 3rd child I returned to Dr. Su for my post partum checkup. I recommend to every woman that I know that is looking for and OB/GYN. He is so knowledgeable, patient, and very timely. I never can understand how he is so prompt with my appointments but I never feel like he is rushing me out to get to the next person.

The negative reviews on here are simply not true. Dr. Edwards is one of the kindest, most caring, compassionate, patient, and thorough MD that you can find. He does not rush patients, listens carefully to everything they tell him, and is a person of integrity. He delivered some of my mom's babies, and if we lived in Houston, he'd deliver mine too.

Upon observation, I would think this is due to the general demographic Dr. Jenkins caters to and their ""home situations"". The staff take that as a reason to talk down to and otherwise disrespect any and all of the MARRIED couples who come for ob/gyn care. The exception to this general rule is his head RN. She, on the other hand, is one of the absolute best RNs I've ever had the pleasure of working with. Also, his practice isn't centered around the patient--it's centered around his personal life, which is a huge no-no. Being ""on call"" in part of his profession and unless you want to be second to whatever's going on in his personal life, I wouldn't recommend."

His staff wasn't always the politest people in the world, i forgot about an appointment during the last trimester due to just being so busy and got the RUDEST call from his scheduling MA. My very last appointment before my son was born i had started bleeding and let one of his medical assistants know and she NEVER told him, i even
brought it up during the appointment and Dr ignored it too. I ended up having heavy bleeding due to early labor and Dr seemed upset about me wanting to deliver at 38w6d (makes no sense since i was full term) and even tried to tell me to go home.

He is very patient and always listens during your appointment. I have been his patient for 10 years now. I have seen through many transitions in life. From coming into adulthood and becoming a mother. He seems so nonchalant at first. However, when you see him in action, you get a whole different impression of him.

Salinas,Houston,Texas,Gynecologist (OBGYN), Male,8,4.94,2014-12-31T13:21:31.498Z,4.5,4,4,5,5,"Dr. Salinas became my doctor after the female Doctor I had went on maturinty leave and I was not aware that she was even pregnant. So I can't remember if I called to make my next appointment or if the office called me to inform me that my female doctor is out. Eventhough I was nervous about having a male doctor I do believe things happen for a reason so I was so happy that I got Dr. Salinas as my doctor because he really cares for his patients and their unborn children. He keeps you informed and answers any questions you may have for him and he is always on point with his detailed answers and just making sure that you understand. Also, he has a great team of staff from the front desk to the nurses in the back I mean they always have a smile
on their faces. So with all that said he is the best doctor that I have ever had."

177,Dr. Joseph A. Salinas,Houston,Texas,Gynecologist (OBGYN), Male,8,4.94,2010-08-04T16:31:23Z,5,5,5,5,5,"When I got pregnant with my first child, I was seeing a female doctor. (don't remember her name) Her services were not the best, but I usually give people the benefit of the doubt. Maybe she was having a bad day. Upon my second dr visit, I learned that this female dr had quit and moved out of the country. All her patients were assigned to the other drs in the office. I was placed with Dr. Joseph Salinas. Dr. Salinas delivered my 1st and 2nd child and I think he is the best OBGYN ever! His staff is also very knowledgable, helpful, friendly and will actually sit down and explain any little thing you don't understand. If they remotely don't know they will contact another medical specialist to make sure your questions get answered. Very punctual, always on time, even when he had to deliver triplets. I couldn't ask for anything better than Dr. Salinas and his staff. I love them all so much!!"

I have referred numbers of women to him when they did not get proper treatment and properly diagnosed by other obgyn's. I have between going to him for almost 25 years.

My experience from beginning to end was everything I could hope for. In the middle of my pregnancy, I experienced the worst headache of my life and called the nurse to find out what medicine I could take. Because i had pre eclampsia in my first pregnancythe nurse insisted I come in for evaluation. I felt foolish heading to the hospital for a headache but it was so painful I figured it couldn't hurt. Luckily, Anding was the doctor on duty that day because he came in to see me promptly and immediately got to work treating my pain. He checked in often and upon no change in my pain no matter what the treatment, he rightfully suspected something more serious. He brought in a neurologist and together they uncovered meningitis! It was a very scary experience but I felt at ease with such a competent doctor by my side. Had a healthy boy last month and couldn't recommend Dr. Anding enough!"

The waiting time is to be expected - he's a gyno not a pediatrician. I have been going to him for the past 10 years and he is just great. Caring and very explanatory on all of the procedures - never made me feel uncomfortable. I highly recommend him...wait, now that I did, I will probably have a longer waiting time :/ he's worth it though."

Her other DR was unable to be reached as this 2day ordeal was happening, so I decided to switch doctors immdiately. Dr. Anding was so helpful and took the time to console my sister as this was her 1st pregnancy. He resured her that she'd have no problems having another baby. 3mth later my sister was pregnant again!! The entire staff is super awesome! Dr. Anding is top notch in his field and that's what my sister deserves! You won't be disappointed. Thou the wait is at times a lil long, we've found Thursdays around 1pm is a great appt time!

She was always willing to answer questions, never rushed me, and was through in her explanations.

Her nurse's response: ""yeah, I don't know why we didn't give you that. We were supposed to."" The reason they gave me for my miscarriages was old age. I'm 37. Not that old.

Dr. Pinell is by far the most amazing doctor I have ever met. I was so impressed with his bedside manner and how well he got my sister through 2 very difficult pregnancies that I became a patient of his 8 years before I had kids so I would be existing and could have him as my OB. Fast forward and he got me through 2 very high risk pregnancies. I now have a 7 year old daughter and 5 year old BBG TRIPLETS. Perfectly healthy. All thanks to him. I still see him every year and look forward to my visit. He and his staff are the most caring group I have ever used.

I specifically asked if I needed someone to come with me when I made the appointment and was not told what was going to be done to me. I was told I could come alone and that it would be no problem. The nurse carried in a ""can"" of frightening tools and made no attempt to prevent me from seeing them. The pain was beyond horrible and when I asked, there was nothing available to assist me with pain control. I am seeing a therapist as a result and regret not stopping him. Dr. Pinell may know medicine but he should consider pain management and discretion before his nurse hands him a foot long rod and shoves it inside of any woman who is not sedated and numbed up. It simply is not OK!"

Once it got closer to delivery he was there on the phone at night and I felt like I was in good hands. My delivery experience at the Womans Hospital was awesome! Now I am pregnant with my 2nd and I feel silly that I was not happy with him at first. I guess I expected more but there is nothing more you need. He is very knowledgeable and I am sure he has seen it all so if there was a problem I am sure he would say it right away.

A.Chavez showed me a picture of my reproductive organs told me right side looks good and asked me about birth control. I have 4boys and we do want more kids. He walked out the room told the nurse to give me a prescription and that was all. I walked out confused because he never checked my stitches to see how the healing process was going, nor did HE tell me what to expect from this procedure, this was my first surgery ever & I lost my fallopian tube. 6/26 stitches have not dissolved.

I think the world of him but, like the other commenter, I feel his front office is the worst I have ever encountered. They are actually rude and leave you with the feeling that you don't matter one bit to them. If it weren't for Dr. Stern himself, I would not return to him over and over. I've been with him since the days of sweet, wonderful Bertha and now the terrific and caring Pat. But I wouldn't give you a dime for the office staff. Oh, and don't even bother calling during their lunch hour to leave a message. The answering service told me that they do not take ANY MESSAGES during lunch hour. I asked, ""Then why do they even send the phones over to you?"" and the answer was, ""Beats us. We get so many angry people tell us the exact same thing, but as long as they want to keep paying us to answer the phone and tell people we don't take messages, we'll keep cashing their checks."" Hand to God, this is what the answering service told me. So, if you can get past the ugly attitude of the office staff, you'll find a wonderful doctor. I'm a glutton for punishment, I suppose, because I've been going to Dr. Stern for over 20 years. Maybe they treat new patients better so you may want to give him a try."

However, the front office staff is the Worst I have ever experienced. They need some guidance in professionalism. Because of this recurring experience, I will be looking for a new doctor. I wanted to see him one last time... and i was told that he would not see me because i have decided to complained about his Staff. I was never able to talk to him to let him know what is going on."

He delivered my son 22 years ago and I was hoping for him to deliver my 1st grandson 4 yrs ago; he would have but my daughter pregnancy turned high risk and Dr. stern referred her to Dr. Kirshon, another excellent doctor near the Woman's Hospital of Texas. I can still remember vividly when Bertha, his head nurse was pressing down on my stomach when I delivered my son. The staff is friendly and very respectful of your privacy. I wouldnt trade Dr. Stern and his staff for no other doctor in this field. When he moves his practice to St. Luke Vintage, I will be following him no matter how far I live. I was actually referred to Dr. Stern by one of my best friends; he delivered her firstborn child. Hopefully, Dr. Stern will deliver my future grandchildren when my son decides to give me my third grandchild. :)-"

I was high risk and had emergency surgery to save her at 16 weeks. Faith was born at 37 weeks weighing 6lbs 14 and it was an emergency delivery. We went in to our visit and Dr Adam said go straight to the hospital, we are delivering now. I didn't know it but I lost all of my amniotic fluid . Our 3 yr old daughter was with me and needless to say my husband made I to Women's from SA in 2 hours! Faith was not breathing and had the umbilical cord wrapped around her when she was born. I did not know it . Dr Adams took control and immediately I heard Faith crying. I did not know until hours later that she was in distress when I delivered. Dr Adams is fabulous. Faith's middle name is Carolina !!!"

I had issues when she said i had to gain weight and minimize my excersice and then stop all together at 20 weeks , because i am a health freak and refused to gain weight. Obviously she knows best and shes for the baby my wants and needs didn't matter if it was going to KILL my children. I love that she has the guts to speak with authority no matter what we (the parents ) think is best. I'm grateful to have such an honest and blunt doctor.

This is how long I've been waiting for each individual appointment so far. 1 hour, 3 hours, 1.5 hours. These times do not include the actual time the doctor spends with me. The staff say this is just how it is because their a high risk clinic. Staff are abrupt and rude. The doctor might appear knowledgeable but lots of doctors are knowledgeable. Bed side manner is horrible and she rushes everything. She practically yelled at me for being underweight (which I'm not my BMI is in the middle of the normal range) and accused me of having a inadequate diet. Which I am certain I don't. I will be finding a new high risk OB because there has to be better options than this dr and clinic. "

She has been my doctor along with my regular OB for five pregnancies! I can say without a doubt she is the reason my oldest child is here, and has seen me through some pretty rough pregnancies since. I have never minded waiting o her, she is worth it! I have never trusted any doctor more. She is a God send.

I spent almost a month in the hospital under her care, and she is always on duty. She even spends the night there, and still has work in the office the next morning. I also hear people complain that's she's late, but I'd rather wait on her because she's simply the best at what she does. She's blunt and honest, but she will save your life!"

The main concern was that my baby at 25 weeks was three weeks behind size and stopped growing. DR Adam took her time with me and conducted the ultrasounds herself to figure out what was wrong with the baby. Well she figured out that the placenta was no good. I had reverse diastolic flow. Therefore, the baby was not being properly nourished. Also, IUGR, low amniotic fluid, and my blood pressure was through the roof. I had to be admitted to the hospital. I delivered my baby at 27 weeks. My baby only weighed 1 pound and 2 ounces. Now, Dr Adam was very honest, and she did say that may baby was way too small and most likely would not make it. But she assured me that she would do everything possible for us to be fine. While being in bed rest at the hospital for a week, my baby's heart rate started dropping. I could tell that it was a very hard decision to make, to either leave her in the womb longer (since she was too small) or take her out and let the baby fight in the NICU. Either way it was a risk, but DR Adam did not risk my baby passing inside of me. She quickly scheduled an emergency c-section. Her quick and smart decision making saved my daughter. My baby girl spent 3 months in the NICU. Now she is almost 2 years old and healthy! Thanks to God, Dr Adam, and the Woman's Hospital of Texas NICU staff.Definitely recommend her. I'll go back to her again if I have another baby in the future. "

She knows her stuff and she's going to tell you how it is. If you're a high risk pregnancy then the majority of your news isn't going to be all that great. But she will see you through and fight for you and your baby. This woman has had a hand in saving so many lives, moms and babies. She can be blunt and sometimes be on the phone consulting or making decisions for another patient while in your appointment but she is worth all of it. I don't live in Houston any more but I told my husband if our third pregnancy needs a high risk doctor that I'm moving back to Texas for Dr. Adam. Pregnancies are emotional especially when they're high risk, but put aside your emotions and do what's right for you and your baby. Go see Dr. Adam."

I had a terrible time with my 2nd child's OB and was tempted to switch back to him at the end of my pregnancy but due to the drive i decided not to. He answer's all your questions, is calm and collected during L&D. He saw me in the street once and asked how I was doing, he checked on me twice when i was in the hospital. Was never rude or rushing around. I loved that they checked baby on u/s every visit. There was few times where i sat in the waiting room for more then 20 min.

On my 1rst visit, it's the typical blood work-up, & I was advised to get a trans-vaginal ultrasound, etc...& come back in 2 weeks for more blood work. In the first visit I expressed my concerns,& our visit was no more than 6 minutes. I still felt lost, but I thought that we would have more to discuss AFTER the results of the ultrasound. I couldn't get thru to the office for a week (left messages), & FINALLY on a Friday while on a plane I finally got thru to his nurse who READ my results (which were not exactly good), & he was THERE at the office! I had so many questions, BUT I figured we could discuss them when I went in for my 2nd blood work. Nope. He just referred me to another doctor, hardly explaining anything, and I felt I was really wasting HIS time.

He is calm, and patient, and I've always walked out of his office happy and reassured. Even when the news wasn't so good, he still made sure that I understood all my options clearly, and could make an informed decision. They had to induce my labor, and when he stopped by to check on me, my partner was out getting lunch. Well, he made sure to go down to the cafeteria, and repeat everything he just told me, just so that we'd all be in the loop. I had a difficult labor, but with his help both me and my son came out of it completely unscathed (well, I had 3 stitches, but felt great). Without his help, I believe I would've ended up with a c-section. Oh, and the delivery room nurses worship the ground he walks on. I am definitely going back to him with all of my pregnancies."

I wish I could use him as my PCP. He truly cares about his patients and actually takes the time to listen to you. He will listen to every silly concern and but will not make you feel like it was silly. He takes his time and makes you feel as though you are his only patient. I originally had another doctor in the office (that I had not met yet & I'm sure was a fine doctor as well) but after a midnight phone call I made and Dr. Hold was the one who called me back, I was amazed with the way he handled my phone call. Other doctors I have had always made me feel bad for calling them at night and would not seem to care. Dr. Hold was very kind and took his time to listen and let me freak out and then calmed me down and asked questions which made me feel very comfortable. I switched to him after that call hoping to get the same care throughout the rest of my pregnancy and that is exactly what I got. I couldn't be any happier with care he has provided me and my then unborn child. I will not change doctors"

My husband is against male OB's, but right away told me to swap docs, and I've never looked back. Took his time explaining everything to us. He wasn't available for my emergency c-section, but I was fine with that, because he was at my bed side checking on me when I woke up and talking with my family answering questions. AMAZING doctor!!

I needed a new gyno after moving to the Katy area and was recommended Dr. La by my PCP in the same building. While having a male gyno was not my first choice, I can say that I never felt rushed like I did at my previous gynecologist. I never felt like I was only being handled by his assistants and I never felt like he was just waiting to yell ""NEXT"" while seeing me. Both before and after the examination he met with me in his office and spoke to me about my issues and how we would proceed. Even better is that most of the GYN's I tried to see about this issue turned me away because I was not pregnant or looking to have a child. They don't care about women in my opinion, but this doctor does! It only took me 3 weeks to get to see him after booking, unlike the 3 months I would have had to wait at some other places."

He's helped me through PMDD, through high cholesterol and anything else he's able to with my insurance requirements. He is my absolute favorite doctor. I have never found a PCP that I feel as comfortable with, so I tend to call Dr. Cone for everything. His staff is phenomenal, particularly Lynne and Becky. They care so very much and they always do what they say they will, usually sooner than they said they would!

She intentionally put me on progostrone for no apparent reason even at 33 weeks with 400 mg daily dose . Then at 34 weeks of my pregnancy she did an altrasound at her clinic and she told me the amniotic fluid was too low at 2 cm. so she made me stay that night In a delivery room with an Iv and by the morning the hospital checked the amniotic fluid and it was 13 cm and got released from the hospital. I had an appointment two days later and after the ultrasound she said that my amniotic fluid was only 1.9! And wanted to deliver the baby after giving it steroids because the lungs won't be fully developed. My husband was with me and told her that it's impossibe for the amniotic fluid to drop to this level without it leaking outside of her body, and that we needed another ultrasound for a second opinion! That did not go well with her and she kept saying ""YOU WILL LOOSE THE BABY"" if you don't deliver it soon! This was my 3rd pregnancy and I just know everything was fine and she was using a dirty tactic to scare me and my husband. So we went to the hospital for another ultrasound test and the surprise was that the hospital said the amniotic fluid was around 8 which was normal! She did not believe the hospital results and came running to me with a flustered look on her face and she did the ultrasound yet again for the 3rd time and this time she said that the fluid is now 4 and that she does not trust the hospital numbers. She said ""that's it get her ready for delivery and put her on IV fluid and steroid and in the mornig I will do the ultrasound my self and don't let anyone else do it"" to the nurse. Me and my husband refused to accept her decision and wanted to get another opinion from a specialist in fetal medicine at memorial Herman hospital. The specialist said after the ultrasound that the amniotic fluid level was fine at 9 cm which is similar to what the hospital measured! At this point me and my husband realized that the doctor was only interested in delivering the baby based on her schedule even though it may risk me and baby's health! We switched doctors and the new doctor was shocked on the treatment we got for the first 8 months and the unessecarly progesterone pills she been given me for no apparent reason other than to collect money for unessecarly testing.

My wife and I asked for a test to determine if certain genetic conditions i.e. downs syndrome, cystic fibrosis existed with our pregnancy. Dr Karges stated she does not perform these tests due to the possibility of the information being used to potentially terminate a pregnancy. Beside all of the crosses hanging in each examination room, we thanked her for her time and moved on to a more realistic Dr."

I started seeing Dr. Karges when I moved to Houston (and even saw Dr. Jemelka, her partner, a couple times), and I just had my second baby. Dr. Karges took such amazing care of my family and me and gave us so much peace of mind. Both doctors, the nurses, and everyone in the office is so considerate and helpful. The nurses quickly returned my many calls when I had questions, and both doctors were always willing to see me asap whenever I was worried about complications. The office is also very clean and comfortable."

It is so nice to have a Catholic doctor who I can trust completely and know that she is protecting my health and fertility in a way that is in line with Catholic morality. For my particular issue, any other doctor would have simply thrown synthetic birth control at me as a ""quick fix"". Instead, Dr Karges worked to repair the root cause of my issue. By monitoring and regulating my progesterone levels in a natural way, I was able to have a healthy and happy baby without compromising my Catholic faith.
To the person complaining about Dr Karges' position against IVF and her religious views: there are signs posted ALL over the office that say ""This office does not support IVF"". So if you are there for IVF support, it should be pretty clear from the moment you walk in the door that you are in the wrong place if you are wanting IVF. Other clues that Dr Karges has a religious affiliation: 1) Her office is located in St Joseph's Hospital; 2) Her practice is called Caritas, which a quick google search will tell you is Latin for charity, one of the three theological virtues; 3) Once you arrive, there are crosses and beautiful prints of Mary and the baby Jesus on the walls. At the check out, there is a statue of the pregnant Mother Mary. Not to mention the aforementioned sign that clearly states that she does not support or provide IVF or birth control.
For me, knowing that IVF and birth control are off the table with her has been immensely comforting. I know that I can trust her, and that she isn't going to recommend anything that will put my morality in jeopardy. Having a doctor who I can trust so wholly and completely with my health and fertility has been amazing. I highly, highly recommend Dr Karges and her whole staff."

As first time parents, we were hoping for a little more compassion when we were going through a scare and had to be rushed to the ER. We called to let her know what was happening and never received a call back. When we finally got a hold of Bridget, her MA, she was not helpful in relaying the information to Dr. Tejml. Bridget is probably the worst part of the experience at this office as she often ""does not know"" and doesn't do much to find out answers for you. Luckily, everything is fine now and our appointments have been steady. So, to sum it up, Dr. Tejml is ok but not great. Besides Bridget, the rest of the staff are very pleasant and helpful."
404,Dr. Krista K. Tejml,Houston,Texas,Gynecologist (OBGYN), Female,11,4.41,2015-05-03T14:29:10.484Z,3,2,3,3,4," THE WORST- Went to the office with my husband for our 1st Ultrasound (US) together, we were brought straight to do the US, it was so emotional & beautiful, my husband holding my hand & both of us tearing up seeing our child for the 1st time together. Then we go to the room & Dr. Tejml tells us there is something really wrong with our chromosome testing. Their protocol for delicate situations such as this is careless & simply wrong. It was a roller coaster of emotions within minutes, when she could have simply seen us before the US, explained what was happening & then completed the US, this would have allowed us to have a different perspective. But it was about the doctors convenience not the patients. Since then I've lost my baby & those memories have made it more difficult. I had to navigate through calling everyone in the city to make an appointment to get further testing, no support from Dr. Tejml office at all, they simply tell you & drop you.
Always answering machine, calls returned at around 24 hours or longer, not the same day, wait times at appointments are fair and to make appointment takes weeks. They have no flexibility. If it's urgent they make no exceptions.
Dr. Tejml over all is a good doctor, reserved but knowledgeable. She has poor follow through. I was going through a complicated pregnancy, she said she would find out something for me, I never heard from her.
GOOD: The day after I received the bad news of my results, I showed up because I her MA did not return my call, Dr. Tejml saw me for a few minutes which was very helpful. A couple of weeks after I also received a call from Dr. Tejml and expressed her sympathy for my situation.
Her MA, Bridget, is careless, Dr. Tejml had requested I come in earlier for an appointment & I didn't receive a call or VM until 2 weeks after, & then she tried to lie saying she had been calling but never left a message until 2 week after, per other staff their protocol is to always leave a message. On another occasion I had urgent questions for Dr. Tejml, waited for hours for the MA, Bridget to return my call, when the call got disconnected she did not call back when I tried to call I got the answering service, when I asked her directly why she didn't call me back, her response, ""Because I had to go to lunch and I had already told you everything that I needed to tell you"" total lack of compassion, careless, clueless and irresponsible.

She listens to all questions and first of all does not scare you. She makes problems seem very simple and makes us feel comfortable. I was worried about my health issue and was totally relieved after visiting her, she makes a thorough examination and takes time to explain us."

Agreed to see me on a day she doesn't usually see patients due to a sensitive medical issue I had. She takes the time to answer all questions and doesn't rush you. I have had both long and short waits at the office but that is normal with OB/GYNs. Easy to get an appointment within a week.

After loosing my first baby, I had a hard time trusting any physician, but she sure earned my trust. I would go back with her over and over again. My baby was born with no complications and I feel like I didn't go through a c-section. She keep checking me during the time I was at the hospital and was always loving and caring. She is truly an angel!"

She delivered my son 16 years ago. Someone recommended her to me and that was the best thing they could have done being that this was my first pregancy she and her staff took real good care of me and even today when I go in for my annuals they are just as friendly and loving as the first day I met them and yes they do remember you and that makes a patient feel so good you are not just another #.

I delivered my first baby boy with her. She has fantastic bedside manners, and really takes time to answer all your questions. She remembers you and makes you feel very comfortable. She is very knowledgeable & its great that you can see Alice, nurse practioner, when her schedule is booked. I would highly recommend her to all my family and friends. The only downside is having to pay for parking every time, but that's everywhere in the medical center!"

She was very welcoming and easy to talk. She even informed me on information I should already have known and gotten from my previous doctor. I was so happy with the visit. The practitioner and staff were also very friendly. I sure hope they're always this way. She explained everything very well, very positive. Thx Dr. Samora-Mata"

I gotta say at first i had my doubts, but then when I read the stuff he asked me to read, and did a couple of home tests to check of symptoms will ease, I was shocked.
He is one heck of a dr, I'm a very picky person and detailed oriented! When I go see a dr I expect to see the best, if I'm not convinced I move to the other one!
After 11 gynos and obgy in 3 years, I'm sold!
None of them knew what was wrong with me even one had the nerve to almost call me crazy saying the pain is in my head!
Until dr Marc Jacobs explains simply its a muscle problem, that's y I thought he was joking! Until I tried some relaxing techniques... :) thank you!"

He went above and beyond when I was pregnant last year. I am a high risk case with high blood pressure he followed me VERY closely. He even came to delivery my son via c-section when he wasn't on call because he knew I was more comfortable with him. I can't say enough good things about Dr. Jacobs. You will have to wait in the waiting room for him as he is very busy.

He has great bedside manner and his office is always neat and clean.

He's been my doctor for 25 years and wouldn't DREAM of going to anyone else. He was the first OB/GYN I went to when I was 16. Scared to death he (and his nurses) put me at ease right away. He delivered both my boys and through the delivery's he was there checking on me making sure I was not in too much pain and as comfortable as possible (he even held the bucket for me when I was getting sick during labor). He sincerely listens to his patients and takes as much time as needed with you. I would strongly suggest anyone go see him, esp. if you have a teen going for the first time he's awesome. He is the most gentle, caring man I've ever met anywhere!"

I felt so violated while she poked at on whole body without telling me exactly what she's doing. She is extremely judgmental about how others live and tries to preach what she believes in.

BELIEVE me she cares about her patients and she is an on call OBGYN and a pregnant woman in labor....well we all know a baby waits for no one. After you spend some time with her you will feel safe in her care and will continue to make appointments with her. My personal story?? SHE SAVED MY LIFE ! She performed my fibroid removal surgery back in the late 90's in my 20's and as we all know they come back. Fast forward to a year ago, I had been suffering with bleeding and extreme pain from fibroids, enodometriosis, scar tissue and on regular pain killers and birth control pills for years. I went to Dr. Crowder to get my birth control refilled and finally she refused. Told me that if I continued I could end up with a blood clot and she was not going to be responsible for my death. She knew I was a MESS inside. Told me to see the experts at Baylor hospital because my surgery was going to be a possible hazard and they could handle it. WAKE UP CALL! I went, scheduled the surgery and sure enough ended up having an 8 1/2 hour surgery with 3 doctors in the operating room! If I had waited any longer I would have had to wear a colostomy bag.

I just got a call from one of the lab companies she sent my tests too asking where there $3000 is. Tell me honestly would you have lether run all those tests knowing it was that much out of pocket ?

LIES , now when i called them to mention this bit of information , and remind them they wrote down all the prices and gave me a total i am now being told that was just a ""QUOTE"" !

Right away I was pleased with how easy it was to discuss my medical history with him. He proved to be knowledgable about my past complications and very encouraging for future pregnancies. He was eager to answer all of my questions and said that he calls his patients himself to give test results. To me the definition of a competent and professional doctor is one who provides medical intervention when the body fails to maintain the functions it is designed to do to keep a person (and baby) healthy. I personally have had and prefer to have a natural delivery, and feel that Dr. Espana is a doctor that would allow a woman to give her body the chance to do what it was desgned to do naturally before resorting to medical intervention. And on the flip side, Dr. Espana was proactive as he explained what he can do to prevent some of the problems that I had in the past. Thanks for your care Dr. Espana!"

I feel incredibly lucky to have him as my doctor. I first saw him for my well woman exam and continued to see him when I got pregnant. He delivered my baby girl just last month and everything went as smoothly as could be. I credit my quick recovery to his skill and coaching. He is everything you want in an OB/GYN - patiently answers all your questions or concerns, great bedside manner and sense of humour, and most importantly, knows his stuff. He makes you feel comfortable and doesn't rush you. All the nurses at the hospital told me I chose really well because he is seriously one of the best doctors there. He will be my OB/GYN until he retires! "

He is an amazing OB and I would reccommend him to anyone."

I had never had a male doctor before & this is our first pregnancy, right now being almost 8 weeks. I was very nervous but once we met with him, I felt comfortable; he was very informative, attentive and funny (not in a sarcastic way either). The person that helped us at the front was very helpful and the lady in the ultrasound was nice. We did not have to wait long but we had a morning appointment & I hear those are the best."

My husband and I called him Quirky McGuirky because his sense of humor was fantastic... he was knowledgable, concerned, mad when I got screwed around by Diabetes America (sent there for gestational diabetes, then he pulled me out), on time for my delivery and a generally just a great, NICE doctor. He was late for appointments A LOT BUT when it was my time to give birth he was RIGHT THERE, so if he's late for your appointment it's because he's working to bring a new baby into the world, he's not out playing golf. Highly recommend Dr. McGuirk to anyone and everyone. Top notch!!"

Mcguirk,Houston,Texas,Gynecologist (OBGYN), Male,15,4.2,2011-08-20T01:02:57Z,4.5,4,4,5,5,"I loved the bedside manner Dr. McGuirk exhibited with my friend years ago, and when I needed to go in for a visit, I asked for him. He listens extremely well and takes the time to ensure his responses are thorough. With other OBGYN's, I felt like they were counting the seconds before moving onto the next patient and more money from seeing tons of patients without truly caring for them. Not with Dr. McGuirk--he is friendly, personable, and does a great job of making his patients feel comfortable even in stressful situations such as labor and delivery. We laughed during my c-section like we were at a party, making the experience fun, not nerve-wracking (repeat c-section after 2 c-sections with other doctors). The front desk staff sometimes seems too busy to smile & be as pleasant as they can be, but when they see grumpy pregnant women all day, it can't be easy to be always upbeat. Punctuality depends on deliveries. I have repeatedly recommended Dr. McGuirk and will continue to do so."

He gave me bad medical advise which resulted in another hemorrhagic cyst which required another surgery. On a different visit, I told him the name of the birth control pill I was currently taking and he pulled a book out of his pocket to look it up. I've never had a doctor do this before. Another time I called in need of an appt. due to serious pain and the girl on the phone told me they were booked and I could go to the emergency room. She refused to work me in or even talk to him on my behalf. Another time, I called due to a yeast infection and again the girl on the phone refused to even contact him about calling in a prescription and told me I had to use meds over the counter which are more expensive. They also over charged me on visits and I'm still waiting to get my money back. I will not use him or this facility again. I have found a better doctor elsewhere."

I had recently moved from Atlanta to Houston and I did not have a relationship with any doctors at the time. He was GOD sent! I picked up the phone and called his office after looking through a directory of doctors at the health insurance website. I was in excruciating pain as I was having an ectopic pregnancy. He got on the phone and instructed me to have someone drive me to his clinic which was just 3 miles away. When I got there he confirmed what he already thought and I was a ""direct admit"" into the hospital for surgery the next day. It could not be performed the first day because I ate earlier and the anesthesiologist needed me to fast for 12 hours prior to surgery (i think). Needless to say his bedside manners was phenomenal. He even gave me his cell phone number to call. I never had a doctor do that. He's amazing and super supportive! He's one of the BEST! ~ La Panamena"

I have never felt more comfortable with a doctor before. He has great bedside manner. He is very friendly and knowledgeable. I have been seeing Dr. Franco for several years and could not be happier with him or his great staff. I have recommended several people to him, including my Mother, and my sister. They are also very pleased with him. They even refers their friends to him too. Now days, it is very hard to find a doctor who actually cares, and listens to your problems or concerns. Well, Dr. Franco is that doctor. It doesn’t matter how much time you need or how many questions you have, Dr. Franco will take the time to make sure you are leaving with all the answers you need. I could not imagine a better doctor, and I am happy to call him mine."

I have always hated going to the doctor but the past months have been a joy my husband and I are so thankful to be blessed with such a wonderful doctor. If your looking for a honest, level headed doctor who really takes his time with every visit and the best part he does not have an attitude or the god complex like most doctors."

They were absolutely phenomenal and recently saw me through a really traumatic pregnancy which could very easily have had a different outcome, but thankfully baby and I survived and are doing well. Diagnosed with High blood pressure (as high as 220/163 at the time of transfer to Dr Gei's care), and eventually pre-eclampsia and HELLP syndrome; with his excellent knowledge, skill, extreme care, patience, etc, he was able to effectively manage the situation resulting in an immensely positive outcome. Many thanks to Dr Gei and the team!"

After my general obstetrician detected a complication, he referred me to Dr. Gei, who specializes in Maternal Fetal Medicine (High Risk Pregnancies). By the time I made it to Dr. Gei, my complication was already too far along and was detected too late by my general obstetrician. Although my baby passed away from an extremely pre-term birth, I have full faith that Dr. Gei did all that was humanly possible to try and save my pregnancy, and had I been transferred earlier to his care, the end result would have been very different. His compassionate and empathetic nature helped turn a sad situation to a hopeful outlook for the future. Dr. Gei’s thorough explanations of my high-risk conditions left me better informed to face and plan for future pregnancies. Instead of rushing through our appointments, Dr. Gei took time to answer all of my questions with terms and analogies that I could easily understand. This may explain why some Internet reviews claim long waiting times during appointments. I look forward to seeing Dr. Gei again for future pregnancies, as I am confident that I will be in good hands."

Wait times to see her were long, but worth the wait. she was very knowledgable and understanding, and spent time listening to all of my concerns. She was very factual but gentle. My last appointment was with her PA, but she came in instead because she was in between patients. Also, during a separate visit, her PA was unsure of her diagnosis, so Dryden came in for a second opinion. Very professional."

My first gynecological exam was a terrible experience and am now in my late 20s and knew I needed to see someone. Got a referral to Dr. Dryden and had to wait a while to get an appointment with her. So glad I waited. I got there early and was able to start immediately. Staff was beyond caring and professional. And Dr. Dryden was smart, thoughtful, attentive. She gave me recommendations for other doctors for other issues, didn't push birth control like so many doctors, and told me to call if I had any other questions or issues. I know I'll have to see her PA next time, but I felt like I was in great hands."

My husband and I have had a ton of issues with pregnancy over the past couple of years, and she has been there for us every step of the way. She is extremely smart and knowledgeable. I wouldn't ordinarily post something, but I read some of the negative reviews and fully disagree. Typically you hear most from people with negative experiences, not positive ones, and that's just not fair. Dr. Dryden is an excellent doctor that cares so much about her patients. She is held in the highest of regards by other doctors, and everyone I know who uses her loves her."

This is my first pregnancy and she has answered all of my questions and always encouraged more. I never feel rushed with her nor her PA. Maybe she has changed staff since some of the other comments but they have always been very helpful and friendly. She has now moved into the Women's Pavilion at the Texas Children's Hospital and the facilities are new and clean. Sometimes there is a wait in the office but it is not usually over 30-45 minutes. I would recommend her to any of my friends or family and intend on using her again for our next pregnancy.

Staff keep claiming I never provided a variety of information (preferred pharmacy, contact info, consent forms, etc.). All things I have filled out/provided AT LEAST once. Did not send my prescription through, so I had to call twice. When I went to pick up my prescription, it was the wrong one. Not worth calling back though seeing as I needed it 1 week before.
When I called for an update on a separate order, I was told I would hear back. One and a half months after my appointment I called again for an update and was only then told that I ""didn't sign the consent form"" (which I waited around an extra 10 minutes for the staff to find after my original appointment and signed).
Long story short: Dr. Tjoa was good, but nothing has gone right since. Will be finding another office after all of this is over unless things improve. Currently waiting for a consent form to my email..."

Yes...sometimes you may have to wait an hour, but you forget she also has to deal with medical emergencies and deliveries for her patients. You can't predict when that will happen, so you have to be understanding. If it was you, I am sure you would be furious if she decided to see her appointments before handling your emergency case. :) She is also very thorough. She always reiterates what she is going to do prior to doing it. Being in the healthcare field as well, you know you have a good doctor when she does that. Hope this review helps."

Then when I asked doctor to speak slowly because English is not my main langue. She said this is her slowest (which is not slower at all) and her voice was not friendly at all. Then she wanted to do PAP smear for me but I refused and I told her I just did that for less than a year. She said I have I had to do it because I was there and changed their cloth already! The way she treated me and her voice (feel like I'm very annoying for her) made me feel very terrible. I will never go back there. This is the worst experiences.

I spoke to Dr regarding this dission, spoke to staff to make sure this devices was covered under my ins and even contacted my ins myself. Went in for the procedure today and was so nervous I did not notice that they paperwork had Mirena on it. I did fill out a questionare asking if I was breastfeeding and checked yes. They inserted the Mirena and sent me on my way. When I was reviewing the after care pamphlets and I noticed it was for Mirena contacted them immedietaly. They DO NOT want to be held accountable and are making me pay for the removal. They were rude and said I should have noticed in the first place. I had a 30 min conversation with the dr, w ins and the verified that Paragaurd was covered w my ins, so why was Mirena in the room??? I recomend for NO ONE to go here."

He sidestepped questions and became defensive and rude upon requests for clarification. However, the worst part of the experience with Dr. Morgan was him saying "" The more questions you ask, the less willing I am to help.

I could remember the time when I was going through some things and he pulled me in his office and took the time out to listen to me and give me positive advice and really made me think about the choices that I had.

He really likes to talk. I am perfectly fine with that! Actually coming from a doctor I like it when they take the time to explain everything. He is very cautious makes sure all tests were run. This doctor is very thorough and has the BEST bedside manner. Very personable sometimes makes his own calls. This OB/GYN group was just featured in a Houston magazine (H Texas) rating them a class act. When my original doctor who helped delivered my 2 sons moved away to Vegas I thought I would never find a Dr as helpful as him. Dr. Tsai is way better and more helpful.

At the end of my pregnancy and had high bp at night for two nights. Then I saw her in the morning and shared my concern, that my numbers were high at night, good in the morning. She took my bp and answered that my numbers were fine. Two days later I called the nurse and told her my numbers on the night before. She took it seriously and send me to the hospital right away. The staff was waiting for me and put me on a monitor. After an hour the OB who was on call told me I needed to deliver immediately because my bp was too high and both me and my baby were at risk. Bottom line, my opinion is that Dr. Schroeder needs to understand that even though her patients do not have a md, they are not clueless about their condition. If she had listened to me, I wouldn't have had to go through this. Yes, I like her personality, she is very gentle, but I need more than that. I need someone who works with me..."

I requested a copy of my medical records on 1/27/17 via fax, which Melissa, the office manager, acknowledged the same day when I called her to confirm receipt. The records would have to be retrieved from off site, as it was a few years since I saw the doctor last. I asked if Lily, the other records person could retrieve them in the coming days as I had a upcoming appt with my new doctor and it was important that review my records prior to my appt. Melissa had an attitude and flat out refused to obtain the records off site, as Lily was busy and unable to leave the office. Melissa assured me that I would have the records within the 15 day statutory required timeframe. I called back a week later and Melissa rudely said she didn't have the records yet and that she still had time to retrieve them under the law. My new appt came and went. 4/5/17 and still no call from Melissa or Lily letting me know that the records were in. I was put on hold for nearly 15 mins and told rudely by Melissa that the records would cost $50 because there are several pages and that I couldn't get my records until I paid. I asked why she didn't call me to let me know the records were available and she said that she was on vacation the previous week. Now mind you, the request was made on 1/27/17. She was unapologetic and flat out rude. When I went to the office the following day to pick up my records, she immediately turned in the opposite direction and ran to the back office upon me advising the secretary of my name. Melissa is a horrible office manager who needs extensive customer service training. Dr Patolia needs to seriously evaluate the type of staff she has working for her."

They screen their calls and have stopped answering, or answer & hang up. They never know how much I am supposed to pay for my visit, claim never to have received sent paperwork, and bill my insurance incorrect amounts and services.
I am so unbelievably frustrated and upset I have to deal with this support staff for this entire pregnancy.

She has always taken the time to address my concerns. Unfortunately, her office staff is joke. The girls in the front look like they don't want to be there but the worst is the billing. The staff has no clear idea the difference between a deductible and co-insurance. I was being overbilled the co-insurance amount because the staff (more than 1 individual) was thinking deductible. No matter how many times I explained it to them that my plan had no annual dedutible, they just don't get it. Her billing staff needs adequate billing training because they are incompetant. They are also rude.

She is very pro vaccine and it rubbed her the wrong way when I refused the flu shot and told her I would need to research other recommendations before I followed through. I felt a lot push on the extras that were out of pocket. I decided to change doctors when it became apparent she was in it for the money when my insurance changed and she would be compensated less. I later discovered a very lengthy lawsuit involving numerous counts of gross negligence that she was found guilty of but in the process of appealing. Bottom line, I did not feel comfortable with all the negative aspects I had encountered over the 6 months of her care.

His office is so easy to get to and is in a beautiful old house with it's own parking lot so no garages or parking fees which is a plus - I hate going into the medical center. He has attended to me since I was 16 years old and is also kind of my PCP as I am not really comfortable with any other doctors. As others have stated there are not many like this out there still.

The stupid who answered the phone asked me if I had seen the doctor before I told her I was referred to the dr by an er physician she went on to ask me why can't I follow up with the er doctor and she doesn't understand why they always giving the dr's name out. I guess someone forgot to informed her that how the dr get business and referral by another dr is key to his practice. Even after I told her the er dr was not an ob/gyn therefore he could not take of my problem she insisted that's the dr I need to follow with. I really cannot review the dr Morgan himself but based on his YouTube he sounds knowledgeable it unfortunate his staffs are not."

He immediately put me at ease and he has been my doctor now for 33 years. I couldn't imagine going to any other doctor. I describe him as brilliant and caring and he is never one without the other. Dr Morgan's staff reflects the type of doctor that he is.

He sets the bar very high for those other doctors that treat their patients just like another dollar sign. Dr. Morgan takes his time to meet with me and explains everything. I have come to him even when it didn't concern OB/Gyn and he's there for me 100%. I highly recommend him."

He is the ONLY doctor who takes the time to talk to you like a person and not just a number. He cares about helping people. He has assisted me in finding other doctors when I have symptoms outside his specialty. He is a doctor first and Ob/Gyn second.

Everyone was very personable and made this a much more enjoyable experience than I thought it would be. I was very nervous walking in the door and immediately felt that wash away as soon as I walked in the door

After our initial consult, I had a good feeling about her. She switched my hormones and said I didn't need to see her for 4-5 months. I made an appointment for follow up 4 months ago. I just received a call saying she will not be available for my appointment in a few days time due to a family commitment which is fine, aside from the fact that the scheduling person informed me that Dr. Hardwick-Smith doesn't have any availability until January and would I be okay seeing a nurse practitioner. I replied no, I wanted to see the Doctor because I have some issues to discuss and why, since they were rescheduling me from an appointment I made 4 months ago, they couldn't make an appointment available. The scheduler just kept repeating, Dr. Hardwick Smith does not have an available slot until January. I told her that was ridiculous. She didn't apologize, she didn't say let me check to see if we can squeeze you in, just. Dr. Hardwick-Smith does not have availability until January. I said since Dr. Hardwick-Smith does not value me as a patient, I have to rethink whether I want to continue my care with her. Again, no apology, just an okay from the voice on the phone."

It's a lie. Drs can CHOOSE to have someone as a witness for their own protection, usually when the Dr is male, but it's NOT a legal requirement for her and I've been to GYNs many times before without anybody observing the exam. It's my preference which she outright refused to honor.
She was also not helpful with the problem I came to see her about, she was dismissive of my symptoms, which is quite frustrating because I don't just make time to go to Drs and have them exam my private parts for no reason. My symptoms were later diagnosed as a valid medical condition by a different doctor, while from Dr. Smith's point of view I was ok."

I came on board skeptical and not expecting them to live up to what they claimed to be. My first appt had some kinks but the whole office bent over backwards to make it work. That meant so much. We sat in her office and just talked for 30 minutes or more before we went any further. We discussed my options *together* as a team.I was down to two options. She encouraged me to first explore the less invasive option that would not have put one dime in her pocket. (it would have meant going to another doctor) While I was a good candidate for that procedure, its not what I chose to do. Dr. HS wound up doing the surgery I desperately needed. It was just as complicated as we both knew it would be all along due to my past medical history. Dr. Hardwick Smith was wonderful and the surgery was flawless. Dr. HS painstakingly answered every question both before and after surgery and addressed every fear in this whole process. Dr. HS is one of a kind."

You can tell the staff really care about what their patients think, they ask you to fill out surveys and follow up on the results. As a doc myself, if you knew how little they get paid for each visit, you would wonder why they bohter puttin gin so much effort. It just hsows that they really care about being excellent, not for the money but for patient satisfaction, and that is so unusual these days. They are growing really fast (from 2 doctors to 5 in just a few years)and there are lots of new faces but I can tell they really screen their staff, I like all the changes!!"

She has taken care of me for routine gynecology issues for the past 8 years plus delivered both of my babies. Her nurse practitioner Brandi is also AWESOME. Staff is prompt in getting back with you within 24 hrs if you have a question. They do a wonderful job addressing all of your questions and concerns about everything from nutrition to exercise. Saw that I looked tired after I delivered and even gave me sleep training advice for the baby as well as a skin consultation (for my tired looking skin).

Worth the wait if you ask me! there are other doctor in the group can see you sooner. they are great too. I find the staff to be excellent."

The Office staff is the WORST EVER!!!!!i can´t say anything about her but they canceled my appointment the day before (After i waited 3 weeks) saying they made a mistake and had to re-schedule me. I was on till they told me they new appointment was in 2 MONTHS!!! I think this is not profesional and i didnt even get to see her. GOOD LUCK!

I have been searching for a new OB/GYN to do my Well Woman Exams because I didn't have a positive experience with another doctor a few years ago. Dr. Tarrant and her staff took time to listen to me and were able to answer all my questions without making me feel rushed. The office is VERY nice and clean. I was able to get in right away when I got there. Overall I had a positive experience would definitely recommend Dr. Tarrant. I will be returning again for all my Well Woman Exams in the future!

I have found that her staff is very attentive and helpful. I really enjoy having a direct number to Dr Tarrant's phone nurse and my calls are always returned. I recently discovered that Dr Tarrant has relocated her practice to the Memorial City area and I must admit that there were some issues trying to find her in August, but all is well now. The best part is that her staff came with her, so I hope to be with Dr Tarrant for many years to come"

Both of my pregnancies were normal (nothing high-risk, no complications) and I delivered naturally with both, so I don't have experience with her in any of that. All of my dealings with her were great. She really took the time to listen to me and my concerns and talk me through them (and I had a LOT, especially during my first). She was never rushed. There were 1 or 2 times that I called and asked one of her nurses a question and never got a call back, but nothing was vital so I just blew it off and asked her at my next appointment. Really my only other complaint is that a couple times I had to wait quite a bit, but overall the wait times weren't horrendous during either of my pregnancies. I definitely recommend her!"

I will first give a brief history of all the issues i had with my pregnancy from hypernemesis gravistis, (severe nausea 15 weeks), placenta previa, preterm birth 33 weeks. I saw her every two- three weeks, she never acted like she was too busy to see me or schedule me in, was very personal and patient. Gave great advice, did not pressure me to do anything I did not want to do. Recommend and explained everything I needed to know about early birth cesarean delivery and possibility of hysterectomy (WHICH I END UP HAVING). she was not on call for the early delivery but everyone in the office knew my case and was very prepared at the hospital they hospital Womens Hospital had everyhting ready and in place even extra surgeons. Dr. Tarrant rushed up there when she heard about the early delivery and was at my bedside every day. I LOVE DR.

She is not very knowledgeable nor is she sensitive to patients care and needs. She can be very combative if you question the care she provides, and make excuses for her actions. She spent twenty minutes with a patient of her ethnicity, and two minutes with me, a patient of a different ethnicity. If you are of a different culture this is not the doctor for you."

She was very attentive and cautious sending me to high risk neonatal for genetic testing. I had 2 high risk pregnancies and she was very proactive, when she needed a consultant (cardiology, criticalcare) she chose the best! I work in the medical center as a registered nurse and almost all of my coworkers choose her. Nurses are highly particular about the doctors we choose for ourselves. I would suggest you schedule a consultation with her and form your own opinion. She is in high demand, if I would actually consider paying cash for the visit and to have her watch over me. There is often a wait in her office, most are there to see her so schedule early am appointments if you mind waiting. If someone is about to deliver you are going to wait. As a nurse I respect that - others may not. If research and teaching is important to you - she does all of that google her. Many of the people you may be considering she has taught-)"

She always erred on the side of caution and if she had the slightest concern, she would do an ultrasound to check on things.

I had never had serious female problems. When my trusted dr moved away, I changed to Dr. Peakes. Upon having a suspect pap smear and a few fibroids, Peakes was quick to decide I needed surgery and probably a hysterectomy. I found the suggestion ludicrous and asked more questions. I was told that the doctor would decide if i had a hysterectomy!! NO WAY!!! I searched and researched and found a wonder doc who was head of the OB/gyn dept at the medical school and was happy to learn that not only did I NOT need a hysterectomy, but that the pap test results were NOT what Peakes had determined. I am happy to still have a healthy reproductive system fully intact 5+ years later. I would NOT recommend Dr. Waverley Peakes."

When we first started the process we found the staff to be courteous. When we called and had a question about scheduling, payment and so forth they immediately called back. So with all the help and reading up on Dr. Rosenfeld we felt comfortable enough to proceed. My tubes were clamped in 2000 so the reversal was done 13years later and I was 36 when the surgery was done. As I stated above the surgery was less than a year ago. Since then we have not become pregnant, and due to wanting a child so bad and not understanding why we haven't had any success in conceiving I spoke to my family doctor and she requested that we do an HSG Test to see if my tubes were blocked or to find out that everything was okay. My husband and I do realize it takes time to conceive but felt in our hearts that something was preventing this from happening. So I had my HSG Test done this month and found out my tubes have a blockage."

I couldn't believe it when she remembered me the day I came to see her again for a routine visit. I can't say enough good things about her. Apart from being a top surgeon and great doctor, she has a great bedside manner, very personable. She's very thorough and knowledgeable in her explanations, and you can see she really cares about you as a patient. She's fantastic, as well as the practice as a whole. I like that it's a practice by women, for women. They're all extremely well-trained."

I was completely nervous and absolutely lost and she was extremely helpful and comforting! Even my husband liked her! He felt comfortable around her (someone who never feels comfortable around doctors ESPECIALLY when it concerns womanly things!) Hoping she will be able to deliver my next baby (crossing my fingers that it will be soon. =p )
608,Dr. Nicole Tran,Houston,Texas,Gynecologist (OBGYN), Female,8,4.42,2011-08-04T07:47:20Z,4.5,4,4,5,5,"Have been going to Dr. Tran for 6 yrs, she always is very thorough and takes the time to answer all my questions and explain things in a manner in which I can understand. Always gives me the good and bad side of the procedure. I only see her once a year unless I have a reason to see her throughout the year and she remembers my histroy. Very thorough doctor."
609,Dr. Nicole Tran,Houston,Texas,Gynecologist (OBGYN), Female,8,4.42,2010-05-30T14:53:04Z,2.5,3,2,2,3,"I used her for my OB/GYN. I don't know if she has too many patients or what, but she does not know her patients. She obviously didn't look or read my chart before visits. She coulnd't remember me having an Ultrasound, and that is because she just went over the results w/ me at the previous vistit, which was only 2 weeks prior. Also, she didn't remember putting me on diabetes medicine, which was a month prior. I know physicians are busy, but seriously, do you not look into your patients charts before you go in a room. I was so upset, being that this had all happened at my 37th week of pregnancy. I would imaging after all that time together, the Dr should know about her patient. I work for 2 oncologists, and I see a huge difference in how they treat their patients compared to her. So to me, there is no real excuse. If I weren't so far along in the pregnancy, I would have changed Dr."

I never waited anymore than 5 min to get into a room, never more than 5 to see her once i got back. She was always so thurough. She gave me all kinds of samples, pamplets, books to read. Refered me to some of the best doctors I have been to. Anytime I had a complaint of illness she questioned everything and ran every test. Gave me all risks and benefits to every procedue and medicine. I would still use her if she only took Medicaid :("

She has great bedside manner and takes her time explaining the plan. As a first time mom, I hesitated picking a young doctor thinking she might have less experience.. and boy.. was I wrong! Picking her was the best decision I ever made! I would be at least 15 min early on my appointments, and the most I ever waited in the waiting room was 5 min. total appointment time was 30- 45 min. Staff was wonderful, very helpful! She was the perfect cheer leader during my active labor. She was punctual as far as making hospital rounds while I was still admitted in the hospital.
Dr. Ratan gave me a wonderful experience during my first pregnancy. I can't thank her enough!"

Not only is he smart, has an ""academic medicine"" background--he has taught OB-Gyn at Baylor and Kansas (I asked). I had his ""teenage"" assistant as well. No problem! I could have refused. She was a college student, and nothing was inappropriate. Love my Dr. J! He has never failed to answer my questions--even when he's rushed. He's super smart, kind, and was Physician of the Year at MHMC! I'll never change docs! ""Thanks for my two babies!"" (My hubby loves him too.)"

He always ends an exam by asking if I have any questions and if everything else is okay. My last annual check up, he did inquire if he could bring in a younger, female student to observe. I didn't see anything inappropriate about the request and was okay with it. However, he left the decision up to me. I usually don't have more than a 15-20 minute wait. On those rare occasions when the wait has been longer, it is due him being called down for an emergency surgery or delivery. Dr. Jackson, and his staff, are just great."

One for an emergency surgery, which when wonderfully and he was very supportive throughout. I saw him for a regular check up and wasn't impressed. I got sent back to him for an urgent surgical procedure. He did the procedure in his office, he was kind, patient, and went out of his way to make sure it was pain free for me. I've heard from many many women who have had this procedure for whom it was traumatic because of the pain. So he's great in a crunch and only so so for a pap. ;-)"

Initially just popped his head in and said there were no problems but when we said we had questions he came in and sat down, he answered lots of questions (even for family members who were with me and concerned about the same problem I had, which runs in families). We were referred by our FP doc who also uses him and we are all very pleased."

I notified him about the baby is not moving much on my last week of pregnancy. He asked me to go to the hospital. I had contractions right after admitted to the hospital. He left me from 6:00p.m that day to the next evening to decide to have a C-section. As it turns out, my baby had the cord around her neck. I was fortunated that the cord wasn't tight enough. My baby had to went through all the scan for her head's bruises. The other doctor would detect the problem before hand. I regret that I believe my friend's ref. Please research the doctor thoroughly. He has too litle time to provide a good care for your baby."

He took me on as a patient in my 28th week of pregnancy when I had a terrible experience with another doctor. He was compassionate and caring. The first appointment we met first in his office and he just listened to me. That was wonderful. He took great care of me and delivered my baby with no complications. I would recommend him to ANYONE!
628,Dr. George B. Jackson,Houston,Texas,Gynecologist (OBGYN), Male,11,4.4,2006-09-11T12:52:19Z,4.3,,4,5,4,"I've been going to Dr. Jackson for over 8 years and love him. I've never had a baby so I've only seen him for my annual check-ups. I'm in and out of there quickly which is what I want. He always asks if there is anything I'd like to talk about, i.e., concerns, issues, etc. I think he's an excellent doctor."
629,Dr. George B. Jackson,Houston,Texas,Gynecologist (OBGYN), Male,11,4.4,2005-11-30T12:43:53Z,3,,4,1,4,"If Dr. Jackson was in the examining room 3 minutes that would be it. There was no follow-up conversationin his office which he has done in the past, although not recently. The standard tests were performed, but no follow-up call to let me know that they were ok. When I called to check, the front desk said, ""We only call if there's a problem."" I have been going to Dr. Jackson for over 20 years and in the past he would spend time asking questions. No more. This time he even brought a teenager in to observe. He asked if she could be there, but I felt it was totally inappropriate. I will not be going back and have found another OB/GYN."

I have had several Ob/Gyns that were condescending and rude. Dr. Wilson was the first Dr. to explain to me some chronic issues I had for nearly a decade. Her staff is generally really great, however I have twice had massive bruises following phlebotomy. Another time the appointment desk wouldn't refer me for a mammogram because of my age, even though Dr. Wilson and I had just discussed my risk factors/symptoms and agreed it was a good next step. "

Dr. Wilson took me on as I was trying to get pregnant and then once I got pregnant. Three months into my pregnancy, her nurse announced to me that Dr. Wilson is no longer delivering babies, and that I needed to find another OB/GYN. Dr. Wilson could not be bothered to tell me this, and I never saw her again. I don't understand why she took me on as a patient if she knew that a few months down the road she would no longer be delivering babies so soon. I had to find a new doctor mid-pregnancy, which was distressing and inconvenient. Though she has a sweet bedside manner, her overall lack of consideration for her patients makes me inclined to recommend that you find another OB/GYN who will be more respectful of your time and pregnancy."

The office staff is absolutely horrible. It's hard to get through to make an appointment. If you have a question about a bill, you have to talk to the appointment desk. The same people who don't answer the phone. Don't bother leaving a message because it will not be returned. If you get through and make an appointment, be prepared to wait for a long time in the waiting room. My prenatal appointments usually lasted at least an hour and a half. Now that I switched to a different Dr, I am in and out in 20 min. Much better!"

She saw us in her office, with my clothes on!, and talked so gently and kindly, like a friend. She asked what I would like to do and my husband was impressed because she asked his opinion as well. She allowed me to try other measures before I ended up having a partial hysterectomy. I felt very confident with her experience. Many friends and family members have since been pleased with Dr Wilson's care. My grandchildren were born under her care. I highly recommend Dr Wilson."

I want to share in hopes someone will read this and get to have the opportunity like I did. I started seeing Dr. Riera last fall when I became pregnant. He followed me through pregnancy and now follows me after. Sometimes it's hard to find a doctor that you feel stays up-to-date on new practices and information but also has a good bedside manner. He is so kind, never makes me feel he is in a hurry, listens to my questions (lists of questions) while never making one question seem unimportant, and takes the time to sit down and see how I am doing. I must also mention that his nurse and medical assistant are wonderful and personable. I am so thankful to call him my doctor."

I had been calling around and all the other doctor receptionist has told me no over the phone which saves me time and money to be rejected at the office. I did my research on Dr. Riera and was very impressed and thought this might actually be the right doctor for me. Come appointment day, Dr. Riera informed me that he doesn't recommend vbac at all, in fact, he said he wouldn't even do it on or recommend it to a family member. I was furious and hurt at the same time, not toward him but the receptionist. I had been waiting weeks for my appointment and I spent $105 for the visit. I'm not rating the doctor, he seems really nice and sincere and is probably an excellent doctor, I am rating the staff. Be sure to call multiple times and speak with different receptionist, if the story changes when asking the same question, 9 times out of 10 they don't have a clue and just giving you BS."

I have been going to her for almost 9 years and she delivered my son last year at 41 weeks. She listened to my concerns and answered all questions when asked.

Also, I would take my older daughter, now 5, with me to my appointments and Dr. Holste and her staff always warmly welcomed her. Love them!"

After having a very subpar experience with her, I came back on this site to re-read the reviews. The review left on 4/15/11 EXACTLY described my experience. As for the positive reviews out there, I am convinced they were written by friends/relatives or by Dr. Holste herself. As a new patient, I expected a more thorough exam, both on the question/answer front and on the exam itself. Like the other reviewer, I did not have any blood drawn, literally only 2 generic questions were asked of me, and the entire exam was rushed, lasting all of 4 minutes. My appt was for 1:30pm, and when I checked my watch while standing outside the building getting ready to head home, it was 1:45pm. I literally left the office thinking ""what in hell just happened?"". My opinion is, Dr. Holste doesn't care about patients or their helath. They are simply dollar signs to her. I highly suggest going elsewhere."

I was less than pleased, I have not ever had such a fast exam, she skipped several things that Dr.'s typically check in a well woman exam, she did not offer to draw blood, I had to ask for this, she did not ask any of the standard questions, I left the office thinking ""what just happened""! I wont go back to her again."

I have been a patient of hers for 10 years and she delivered my son last year. The office sometimes runs very behind, but I have found that to be an issue at every OB/Gyn that I have ever been to. Unfortunately our insurance has changed and she is not in network. I would continue to see her for my annual exams, but since we will be trying for another baby an out of network provider could be rather expensive. I would recommend her to anyone!"

She delivered my son and I have always thought the world of her. However, I have recently seen her twice and both times she rushed through my appointment and was less than friendly. I don't know if she is overbooked or what but I am pretty disappointed by the lack of attention I received. I am usually not one to gripe but in this case I hope that someone from her office will read this and they can get back to what they were doing 4 years ago which was taking time with each patient and making them feel very comfortable and well cared for. Dr. Holste is really good and knowledgable - I just think her bedside manner has not been as good recently. :("

Forced medical procedures on me without telling me why. Would take blood work and then never go over the results with me. Ended up pushing me off to a high risk clinic because they thought I was lying about having previous health issues. I was asked every appointment was I was even sent to a high risk clinic.
The labor and delivery nurses also told me he was c-section happy, he only wants you to deliver on his time."

I am so disappointed that I chose Dr. Cook for my first pregnancy. I really regret my decision especially after what happened during delivery. The very second visit after I found out I was pregnant, they already had the bill for the WHOLE pregnancy visits ready for me to pay. I had to pay upfront half of the entire cost and then a month later the other half. For the entire 9 months, I saw Dr. Cook maybe 5 times. He was always busy, overbooked or I had to wait sometimes 45 minutes to one hour in the room to see him for literally 5 MINUTES. He was always in a rush. The last visits I was always seeing different doctors. Some nurses were very nice and kind to me but the women at the reception are just HORRIBLE. Worst customer service. The worst part of my experience with Dr. Cook and the OBGYN Center was right at the end. On week 38, I saw the doctor for maybe 5 minutes, he was brief, touched my belly and then few minutes later the nurse Mary Jane was already scheduling the day to have my delivery induced. I ended up delivering my baby on the due date without being induced but Dr. Cook NEVER SHOWED UP. I delivered my baby with the doctor on call at that time around 6:45AM – When I asked for Dr. Cook nurses said he usually starts his day at 7AM. He did not even see me right after I delivered my baby that morning. He showed up that day at 6PM!!!! All he said to me was that I had a good delivery and everything looked fine. I had a 3rd degree tear, which he never told me about. I found out about it 2 days after my delivery by the other doctor in his practice and mainly because I started noticing, something was not right. Communication was minimal; he was always in a rush since the DAY ONE up until my last visit, which was only 2 weeks after my delivery. After 9 months of pregnancy seeing Dr. Cook, he showed up almost 12 HOURS AFTER MY DELIVERY! Never told me a had a major tear and NEVER apologized for not being at the delivery of my baby. Insensible, careless and not personable at ALL. Unfortunately, the worst decision I made was to pick him as my doctor for my first pregnancy. "

I have been seeing him and his wife (they are at the same practice) for over a year. They are on time and it's so easy to get an appointment. He listens to my concerns and is understanding and compassionate. He is also extremely experienced and professional. He is honest and doesn't beat around the bush. He is a straight shooter. I highly recommend this practice and Dr. Cook. Amazing doctor and for anyone who is hesitate to use a male doctor I would highly recommend him!
If you are short on time, don't use the med
Center office! I have used other doctors with offices at the med center and I believe you should deliver at a med center hospital but I recommend booking your appointments at a satellite office. All med center doctors' office are extremely busy (especially since they may be at the hospital during your appt. which is out of their control) and parking is expensive.
USE THEIR SATELLITE OFFICE!
They have a satellite office so you don't have to fight the med center traffic but also have all the benefits of a doctor who practices in the Houston Med Center. Great doctor and amazing practice group."

I thought I found a great place in a professional office. I was wrong. Unfortunately, you will rarely see him. On my second visit, I was quite disappointed to discover a team of doctors --a new one each visit- would be taking care of me. I did not know who to trust. I felt rushed and always like a number. At the first meeting, I shared my requests to have the least invasive procedure as possible and my delivery turned into the complete nightmare I so badly tried to prevent. Initially, I expressed my interest in a natural birth and Dr. Cook politely said ""No You Don't."" I should have known then this office was not the place for me. My second red flag was when another doctor on the team tried to induce me at 38 wks for no apparent reason (perhaps 4th of July plans). I refused and the office called a second time trying to induce me on my due date at 40wks. Finally, 3 days after my due date the office called me in to check on me and the games began. The office worker who sends you over to the hospital was extremely rude! She had no concern for me period. Once in the hospital I was induced and that did not work. So, Dr. Melhem who I was meeting for the first time broke my water without my permission then I was forced on Pitocin almost to the maximum offered. After 3 doctors, 3 nurses and 8 hrs later and I was forced to have an ""Emergency C-Section"" that was clearly unnecessary if they would have allowed my body to naturally labor. My experience at this office ended up traumatizing me instead of creating a happy healthy memory. Although, Dr. Cook is very nice and warm person his team does not share his same warmth. This office is all about numbers and money. I will not recommend anyone goes here. If you do always ask several question. Do not allow anyone to force a C-section (Major Surgery) unless absolutely necessary."

I absolutely love Dr. Cook, Dr. Melhem and Dr. Nanda! They are highly knowlegeble, compassionate, with exceptional bedside manner. However, the practice has grown significantly over there past 14 years which has negatively impacted the wait time and forced me to settle for exams with newer physicians in the practice. I know insurance reimbursement in ObGyn practices are some of the lowest, forcing ObGyn MD's to open there practices up to larger patient volumes and often lowering quality of the visit. Even with this being said, I have recommended and will continue to recommend my family and friends to there practice."

Although he is a very nice person and a good physician his practice has expanded to the point that they have sacrificed quality over quantity. Most of the time the wait is extensive, when they finally see you, they are rushing to get you out as soon as possible. They often switch doctors and even if you request to see one doctor, another comes instead. Dr. Cook's practice seems to be interested only in the revenues. Recently, my daughter(who was delivered by Dr. Cook himself 20 years ago, made an appointment to see Dr. Stephani, who works in the same practice. She was seen by Dr. Cook's wife instead(Dr.Gable). She was not only rude but insensitive and impolite. My daughter came home crying and upset for the misdiagnosis given by her. I am a nurse, I know a thing or two about being appropriate to patients. After 20 plus years, not only my daughter, but I will no longer see Dr.Cook & associates nor recommend them to anyone."

My 1st appt I waited 45 minutes, got my u/s done by Dr.Melhelm. Next week I woke up bleeding-I already had an appoint that morning. Waited 30 minutes to get a room, told the technician my concerns, she said ""yikes,"" left for 30 minutes. When I saw Dr.cook he told me if I was m/c, I wouldn't want the baby anyway (as he was checking his phone) 4 hrs. later m/c confirmed. No follow up info given other than see you next week. I called the office 2x for more info, no response. They called back 4 days later to tell me Dr.Cook couldn't see me and had to reschedule. As it was a receptionist, got no answers. That day I got 2 letters (same info-sloppy office) with prescriptions attch from Cook stating I had an infection. Letters dated BEFORE m/c. Never told me when he saw me, or called. WORST PART-went to my new ob, he asked if I'd had my Rhogam shot bc I'm a negative blood type. It's only effective if given 72 hrs after mc. Cook didnt care enough to check."

I was really freaked out so I called my OB's office and it connected me to a 24 hour line. I had to reluctantly share my problem with the woman that answered the phone then she transferred me to Dr. White who was the on call physician for my OB at the time. When I explained my problem and told him I was concerned and afraid he did all but yell at me. He asked me why I thought calling him at 11:00 would solve the problem and asked how I thought he could help me in the middle of the night. He told me to call and schedule an appointment with my OB in the morning. I guess the woman that answered should've told me it wasn't an emergency and not connected me. I was very scared and his extremely rude reaction only upset me further. Definitely do not recommend.

The staff never told me what was going on until I complained. They left me in the room disrobed in the dressing they provide for approx. 30 more minutes of waiting. I complained to him when he entered and he said he had delivered a baby. That's all well and good but someone shoudl have given me the chance to reschedule when I came in and he was already out of the office delivering. He also only spent minutes with me and was out as fast as he could leave. Staff seems not to have compassion for those without insurance, no one can give you a price for your services until after you are done. Tried to charge me for a mammogram I did not recieve. Several mix ups over a few years time on my bills. On the up side their office caught and removed precancerous cells (surgery was over 10K tho and about half covered by insurance, surgery took like 10 minutes). Other appointments usually late 30-45 minutes or so."

I had female problems with heavy bleeding over the holidays. He gave me his personal cell phone # and house phone # in case I had other problems. He came to hospital to see me while his office was closed for holidays. He arranged to have a room ready for me on the maternity floor. Dr Miro will go out of his way to make sure you are OK.

Since I was getting pap smears to now my baby in my belly. He may seem a little less ""worried"" about the little things he usually calls them normal stuff. I like that he is relaxed and wont tell you dont do THIS and THAT like some doctors like to scare you for everything. He called me back every time I had a concern during pregnancy. In my opinion, he is great and I will definitely keep going to him for the next baby or just for checkups. I've recommended him to all of my friends."

He delivered my 3 children and I'm also seeing him for my current pregnancy. Dr. Miro has had the same staff for all of many years I've been seeing him. That says a lot about him as a person. He is always very attentive and respectful. He explains things in detail and expressed genuine care and concern for his patients. I was recommended to him 16 years ago by my mother who is now a retired nurse. I've also recommended Dr. Miro to several of my friends. He's an excellent doctor.

I only saw him 5 times throughout my pregnancy, including the day he delivered my baby. He did not ever listen to any of my concerns and seems to think everything is happy go lucky even when you are experiencing serious symptoms of a complicated pregnancy. Handled me very rough in the delivery room. Did not check on me before he discharged me from the hospital. Had to go in for two week check up, but all that happened was his nurse practitioner tried to get me to agree to a birth control plan because ""we don't want another one any time soon"". Apparently does not do six week check ups either and if something is not healing correctly down there they would not know because they never check. Saw Miro in hallway 10 days after he delivered my baby and he didn't recognize me. Not what I expected considering so many women recommended him to me."

She was warm and seemed thorough, but once you become pregnant and begin to have complications, she becomes cold, clinical, and down right negligent. This is true for her MA as well. My pregnancy ended in a miscarriage and the only things down were HCG levels tested and ultrasounds. Progesterone levels were not tested at all. The second time I became pregnant, I requested for my progesterone levels to be tested. They came back low and I was told by her MA that I would miscarry and that I could be prescribed progesterone, but it probably wouldn't help anyway. Just like that. My progesterone levels were never tested after that to make sure the progesterone was working. Dr. Desplinter does not explain things very clearly, and her MA is just as cold. The overall attitude is ""Meh, you're going to miscarry, so we'll just do ultrasounds to monitor."" She doesn't seem to fight for your unborn child. I would highly recommend going to a different doctor."

I have been seeing Dr DeSplinter for about 5 years. Until the past year, it was always a pleasure dealing with her and her office staff. I feel that Dr DeSplinter has become condescending and does not explain thoroughly. Last year I got pregnant and had many visits. I feel like I spent half my life dealing with billing issues. If there was anything done other than a prenatal visit, I was on the phone because claims were submitted (and denied) due to lack of codes. The billing department is a NIGHTMARE. Billing for lab issues go to Della and messages aren't returned for 7 days. Billing for other services are routed through the hospital so issues are seldom sent back to the Dr. I recently got put on the hook for over $430 for an ultrasound following IUD placement. The DR coded this as routine- thus this is not covered as routine care. Since when is an IUD placement routine healthcare? This is so ridiculous. Save your time, money and your sanity and DO NOT GO HERE.

First , many women /first time expecting parents cant discuss ob gyn issues with friends and secondly , I have learnt lot abt services by reading reviews and wanted to give back.
I came to know about Dr Sutaria as our PCP told us that she is an excellent doctor and all her patients she referred love her . She is the best doctor in town . Every single visit she used to thoroughly examine , answers all heath concerns, guides what to expect/ what not to expect. My wife didnt go to labor till 42 weeks and was being induced . The hospital at memorial city is state of art and the doctor was up all night monitoring the induction , she came at 5:30 am to visit , and routinely visited. She was there entire labor and then the baby was too big and it was medically necessary to perform cesarean section. She did an excellent surgery and post partum recovery was also fast . She is a blessing to Houston and her patients . I can never thank her enough for delivering my little angel. I see many ppl are upset of long wait times, but labor pain , deliveries, false alarms of labor arent planned . Many times physicians have to rush to see someone in labor vs routine exam , as healthcare is about providing care to one who needs it most first. I can never thank her enough , Best OB GYN."

I went back the second time and was in the room for about 5 minutes received a sample and a week later or so I received a bill. I called to see what exactly I was being charged for. The billing lady said well didn’t you get a pap done I said no then she says well didn’t you get a sample I said yes so she said that was a $200-$300 dollar medicine you got. We went back and forth and need to say she still couldn’t tell me what I was being changed for.I paid my co-pay went in the back the Dr. did nothing but gave me a sample, so I’m guessing I had to pay for the sample or the 5 or so minutes I was in the back 🤷🏽‍♀️. When I left my 2nd appointment I had to stop at the front desk to sign a release form for my next visit. I asked the girl if they will have it by my next visit she stated yes. The morning of my 3rd appointment I called to check if they received my records and she said I will have to talk to the nurse, I told her my appointment is this afternoon and I would like to know before I come there. Need to say she still transferred me to the nurse 🤦🏽‍♀️. When I arrived there she checked me in a said the amount Of my co-pay, I told her I wasn’t going to pay until she told me if they had my records. She goes in the back for about 5 minutes and comes back and says no we don’t have your records. I told her this is why I called before I came so this wouldn’t have happened. After all that yes I made another appointment my 4th and 10 minutes before my appointment the girl called me and stated she just looked at my chart and seen that I was no longer a patient there. I asked her why and she says I don’t know why it don’t say. I told her why am I just getting a call about this? Why when the appointment was made I didn’t get a call? Even the day before they could’ve called or the morning of. I’m in the parking lot and she calls the morning of 10 minutes before my appointment and she says sorry 😡. Dr. Bailey is nice but the staff is... HORRIBLE, UNPROFESSIONAL, DISORGANIZED, DON’T CARE ATTITUDE, LAZY !!! They can treat patients any kind of way but when we as in patients treat them in that same way they drop you as a patient."

I switched doctors 21 weeks pregnant and was a little apprehensive about finding a new doctor based upon my last experience. I am so happy I found Dr. Bailey! As a first time mom there are so many ""unknowns,"" but Dr. Bailey answered all my questions and reassured me during and after my pregnancy. She doesn't just talk to you as your doctor, but makes you feel like a friend.

Patients before you have already gone. Staff and doctor are talking while you are waiting. Lack of communication, no follow up call after tests are done, staff is rude, They do not treat patients with courtesy and respect.

He has a sense of humor and I liked that. He answers all your questions and makes sure nothing is wrong with you or the baby. If you get sick and don't know what what you can take you call and they tell very friendly staff. I know he might not be very punctual but I know he get emergency calls from mother who are about to deliver or are in the process. He tries his best to give his best in his office and hospital. It's not easy to take care of two places at the same time. I would never change OB his my favorite even though I have told him 2 times I'm no longer getting pregnant. Lol he doesn't believe me now.

When he's in a bad mood it's enough to make you cry. He always sent me to hospital for everything because his office wasn't capable of anything. Very rude during my delivery as well. Plus he cut the cord when my husband wanted to. I could go on and on but I really didn't care for him when I used him.

I was scared I would be sitting in clinic looking like a DMV with screaming kids and illiterate adults. Luckily, I found Dr. Battaglia and his wonderful staff! I was very pleased! The staff made me feel comfortable and Dr. Battaglia made me laugh! I was sent to the hospital due to high blood pressure during my pregnancy at 36 weeks. We decided on a c-section because I was too worn out to go through labor.I was in the operating room with in 30 minutes! He knew what he was doing and got it done fast!

He showed himself to be arrogant, rude, and inconsiderate during my visits. During my pregnancy he put me through countless tests that were unnecessary and it appeared to me that he was trying to make more money. After my c-section he kept me in the hospital longer than needed. He rarely came by to check on me because he was in lawschool at the time. He didn't even deliver my son. The few times he did come by the hospital he was rude to me and my husband. He did not want to answer our questions or alleviate our concerns. He is a personal injury lawyer representing clients which include medical malpractice and birth injuries. It seems like a conflict of interest. http://www.abrahamwatkins.com/Attorney-Profiles/Frank-J-Battaglia.shtml (I won't ever use him again.)"

Doctors seem to get on a pedestal along with the nurses that they are above everyone else and have no regard for the people that actually come in and pay their salaries...I will never go back and will find another doctor...she and her nurse are AWFUL."

We paid the up front fee of $3,000 because our insurance wouldn't pay for the procedure. As we left, they told us that they would try to work with our insurance to find some way to get them to pay and send us a refund if they were able to. About 3 months later, after the insurance sent them over $2,000, they told us that they were not going to send us a refund, because the insurance said that the bills they claimed should have cost more than we paid. So, we paid for everything up front, and then they kept the insurance money as well. They get away with it by claiming that what we paid was only a ""surgical fee."" That said, I begrudgingly have to admit that the care we received was pretty good. Dr. Meltzer is knowledgeable and efficient with what he does. If your insurance covers the care, I'm sure you'll be satisfied with him. Just don't count on receiving any kind of refund if you're promised one."

I had seen 2 other doctors several times and the results always come back normal. I love the fact that she listens to you and tries to rule out all of the possible problems. She also asks probing questions so help further diagnose you by testing all possibilities based on your symptoms even when your labs say normal. I also love the fact that the lab results are posted online and I can view my progress in one place. My appointments always run true to schedule and I am normally in and out within less than an hour. All my questions are answered and I never feel rushed. She has been truly concerned with my health where my previous OB/GYN that has seen me for over 20 years sends me home because my results are normal even though I complain of the symptoms.

Then, I told her I was going on a special diet (for PCOS) she laughed and said go to my GP for diet advice. Appointments were 60 seconds or less because I wasn't pregnant or trying to get pregnant.

All I could think of was OMG poor people!! Overall it was a terrible experience, the online portal was set up with the wrong information. The test results where not explained to me. The doctor just told the staff to tell me that I needed a follow up & biopsy. I asked to speak to doctor and they wouldn't let me, the secretary acting like a doctor kept giving me medical terminology. For appointments they are not only unprofessional but not accommodating at all. They wouldn't reschedule for the next 2 weeks!

I am hypothyroid but I have no problems with ovulation or periods. When I went to Dr Roberts it was like she had rehearsed what to say n just came in said it n left. Neither did she listen to what I had to say nor did she ask me if I had questions . I stopped her on her way out n asked a couple of questions n got the same text book answers. She just recommended clomid though my but charts proved I was ovulating . She did not have the patience or courtesy to wait until I finished. I figured out her level of knowledge
Is pretty bad too because I went to another obgyn who put me on low dose metformin n I got pregnant within the next cycle. I would not recommend her to anyone except someone with a very safe very normal pregnancy with absolutely no surprises for she has neither the knowledge nor the patience for dealing with real issues"

809,Dr. Erica A. Roberts,Houston,Texas,Gynecologist (OBGYN), Female,30,3.5,2014-08-19T23:55:16.311Z,2.5,2,2,2,4,"Dr. Roberts is a good doctor. The office staff is not as good, and honestly you have to deal with them more than you deal with or see the doctor.
-On one appointment during check-in I was turned away because they said they no longer accepted my insurance. It ended up being a mistake on their part that I had to figure out on my own. I left the appointment, called my insurance, and rescheduled once they realized their mistake. I basically lost two days on a routine visit to the doctor due to the staff's mistakes.
-On another appointment I was their for a shot, which they administered fairly quickly. However I was left waiting to see Dr. Roberts for 45 minutes. I asked the staff where she was and what I was waiting for. They said I had to wait for a prescription refill, but I explained I was their for a shot and didn't need a prescription refilled. They actually argued with me about why I was there. Since I had the shot I made the appointment for I explained I was leaving because I didn't need a prescription refill and Dr. Roberts still hadn't seen me 45 minutes after the shot. As I was leaving the staff yelled across the waiting room again that since I left I wouldn't have my prescription refilled. Unprofessional and a little disconcerting that they were arguing with me about why I was there.
In neither case, did I hear from Dr. Roberts nor am I sure she knew what was going on. Like a said a good doctor, but is the five minute visit with her worth all the issues with her staff? I'm not sure."

She has delivered all three of my children and helped me through two miscarriages. She is gentle and caring. After my first miscarriage, she was very realistic when discussing my options and explaining what I should consider before trying again. Once she discovered that my second attempt was going to be successful she was more happy and relieved than I was. I was still uncertain but she guided me through it. I would recommend her."

My wife went to the ER bleeding 10 weeks pregnant and got reassurance from the ER docs but was understandably scared. Dr Baird's nurse Natasha was slightly helpful but made no offer to get the records from the ER & instead asked my wife--mind you who was scared she was going to miscarry--to get them. She had no luck & waited an entire day to hear back from the ER until finally asking Nstasha if she could get the records from the ER. So, finally, Natasha sent over z release form, my wife signed it, emailed it back, & asked for a receipt confirmation, which of course she did not get. She did get a call from the nurse saying Bsird said everything was ""fine"" the next morning--but no info other than that. So, this morning she woke up with dome bleeding & called Dr Baird's nurse station. Natasha said to call back mid day & set how she was doing. So, she finally got Narasha on the phone & she refused to work her into Bsird's schedule despite her being so scared."

I picked her because she is in the Woman's Hospital. I was tricked by her smile in the picture. When I told her my concerns she was very rude to me and did not take my concerns seriously.

I have always found her to be extremely caring, supportive, and professional. During my pregnancy, I loved that she was very realistic about what is truly required for a healthy pregnancy (I found many books to be unrealistic with regard to what you should and shouldn't eat and do). She is very friendly, has a good sense of humor, and really takes the time to explain everything. I especially appreciate that she was very patient and stayed late to help my sister through a very long and difficult delivery. She clearly has a busy schedule, but that has never stop her from providing thorough accurate answers to all my questions and quality care. Before my pregnancy, I appreciated that she explains everything very well, so you know what to expect, and I found her to be very gentle (a must in my opinion)."

Her brilliance was evident in the prenatal care she gave me for both pregnancies in Houston. She delivered my two very healthy babies (one was a c-section and the other a successful vbac) and was supportive and encouraging of my vbac endeavours. She never once tried to discourage me. She was always engaged in our discussions, and showed a great deal of love and interest in my first born when he would attend appointments with me. She would always comment on how great he looked, how quickly he is growing up, and would often give him lots of hugs before sending us on our way. Dr. Baird is efficient in our meetings, which may be what some of the other reviewers deem as abrupt, but her professionalism is not neglected by any means. She does have a great sense of humor and always seemed very focused. I was very sad to move to Washington D.C. and leave this practice behind...especially now with baby #3 on the way. I highly recommend Dr. Baird."

She made me feel like I did not know what I needed and was EXTREMELY unhelpful in my hour of need and pain. In addition, the billing department is the most incompetent I have ever had the displeasure of experiencing. The doctor made a mistake so I had to reschedule my appointment and they told me I would not be charged. Now over one year later they are still harassing me for a bill I do not owe and have turned my name into a collection agency. I have spoken to them countless times and they have repeatedly reassured me that they would reverse the charge, but it is still not right. I do not know what else to do but to go down there in person and start screaming in front of the whole office."

Loved Dr. Neal as well but after 3 years under her care...she retired too. Then Dr. Baird. Not sure about her. I loved Candy the nurse as she was with Dr. Neal. I was staying with Baird because of Candy (nurse) but decided I had to leave Dr. Baird. I am 70 years old and needed more than I felt she had to offer me. I am leaving OB-GYN and associates after years of being a patient there. I need an older female doctor who knows more and understands more about the ageing female body. No more young Ob-GYN's.

When I got pregnant with my twins she was so helpful in answering any questions I had since it was also my first time being preg. She was also very open minded on letting me choose a vaginal birth and did not ever push a c section like many other Dr's would. I ended up with a wonderful pregnancy and delivery thanks to her and all her helpful advice and support! She is a fabulous Dr and I would recommend her to anyone :) I love the way she also takes her time with her patients and answers and explains any questions I had. She does not at all make me feel rushed during the appointments. Overall Dr Smith was the best and I will definitely be using her again for my next pregnancy :)

Those girls have always been super kind and sweet. Keep in mind, they are super busy. This doctor is one of a kind. Goid luck finding one as specialized as him. My doctor from 20 yrs ago almost killed me. Dr. Papa found my problem during the 1st visit!!! And I don't know what I will ever do if he stops practicing. Maybe some of you are simply looking for a friend. I was looking for a great doctor, was referred to him by a friend, and he saved her reproductive system that many other doctors couldn't. So I don't know what was going on for those of you with the bad reviews, but it blows my mind to hear them. I even had to make a new appt one time when he got called out of office for an emergency cesarean at the hospital. Years later he got called out of office to do the same for me. So quit your whining. This is one fine doctor that you can trust! I just love Dr. Papa!"

Rude, incompetent and mean come to mind. Though I have come to trust the Doctor's skills, the staff has made it so unbearable to ever return. He needs an overhaul in staff, and they need to be trained on people skills and how to talk to and deal with people. You know the people that help pay their checks. The clients who are left are only hanging on because of the doctor himself. Whenever I recall my visits dealing with the staff, I can't believe I tolerated the treatment I received. I will never return and tell all my friends and family to avoid."

I found his staff to be rude and clueless. The office seemed really outdated and the wait time was way too long. You pay for parking, they will not reimburse. I went in for one appointment and felt like a number dealing with not so professional staff. I saw the doctor for a few minutes, tried to ask questions and he seemed to care less. He would not tell me what to expect for the next visit expect to say make an appointment. I asked the appointment lady and she didn't know the answer either.

She is a very skilled surgeon that gave me a myomectomy when other doctors said it could not be done. Now, I'm healthy and back to normal and can have a normal pregnancy.

She was dead set that I have a specific STD, which turned out negative. On top of that, she did not even run any other tests nor asks me anything about my symptoms. She was very concern about my sex life and told me that she is almost positive that I have a STD. She booked me another appointment for her to READ me my results when they could have just given it to me. I went to another doctor who diagnosed me with UTI infection before getting my results because I progressive got worst while waiting. Dr. Holz and her staff only cared about the co-pay and her staff made it seem like she's a federal judge who cannot be seen until you make a payment, when all I wanted was my result."

My second pregnancy was more difficult and high risk, and she again has been wonderful and amazing! I am so sad that I have to leave her since I am moving again, but she has helped me and is available until I have to leave. Her nurses always got back to me quickly and answered my questions or got with Dr. Ball and called me back quickly. I fully recommend Dr. Ball to anyone! She is really amazing!"

Although I had tried to make an appointment several times and wasn't unable to get through bc busy phone lines. When I did come in the front office staff was friendly although very busy. I had some issues with them not writing down my insurance and trying to charge me out of pocket but it was resolved. Seems like they need to staff more people or be more efficient but Dr. Ball is great and is worth the hassle.

I was sad after having my baby that I wouldn't get to see her each week. She always took as much time as I wanted and answered every question I had. I can't recommend her enough. I will definitely continue to use her.

The front office staff...blah. They're not really friendly and rude on the phone. I tried to make an appt and they told me that I couldn't because I wasn't enough weeks and would not allow me to see my doctor unless I had some issues going on. They had me rethinking keeping her as my doctor.

She was my general doctor for woman exams, and then I got pregnant and she has helped me through my pregnancy. Very knowledgeable and easy to talk to. I recommend her to anyone!!!"
856,Dr. Carrie J. Ball,Houston,Texas,Gynecologist (OBGYN), Female,9,4.03,2010-02-03T17:02:20Z,2,3,3,1,1,"The front offfice staff was kind of rude. Once I got into the room I waited about 10 minutes (not to bad). She told me absolutly nothing useful, was only there literally for around 3-4 minutes. So I saved my money so I could have a problem checked out and it was basically wasted because I got no information and paid full price. She left her office to go to another location before I even finished paying."
857,Dr. Sue M. Palmer,Houston,Texas,Gynecologist (OBGYN), Female,8,4.09,2015-07-26T03:49:51.525Z,5,5,5,5,5,"I will start off by saying that I am an extremely picky person, with outrageously high standards. With that, Dr. Palmer met and surpassed all my hopes of the doctor that would see me through my pregnancies. She is a truly fantastic doctor whose actions speak volumes about how very much she cares about her patients and their babies. During my first pregnancy in 2010 my OB referred me to Dr. Palmer after determining I had gestational diabetes. Respecting that I did not wish to take insulin shots, Dr. Palmer worked meticulously with me on a weekly basis to adjust my diet so that I was able to control my blood sugar levels through diet modifications alone. At every appointment her ultrasound technician would perform an ultrasound. Afterwards, Dr. Palmer would come into the examination room to review the information the technician had collected, spend time collecting more information, and then afterwards invite me into her office to visit about how my pregnancy was going and to answer any questions I had. Really, it was an absolute dream. I do not know any other doctor who spends so much time with his or her patients and is so truly available.
I appreciated my experience so much with Dr. Palmer that I went to her for both consultation and delivery of our second baby in 2014. And again, I cannot say enough wonderful things about my experience with Dr. Palmer during this pregnancy as well.

I was high risk because I was diagnosed with diabetes prior to pregnancy and thanks to her I delivered 2 healthy baby girls. She truly cares about her patients and takes the time to go over weekly diet and blood sugar logs to see if any improvements need to be made. She is a ""no nonsense"" type of doctor and gives it to you straight, but like your own mother would. I remember crying a couple of times in her office because she was being tough on me for not following a healthy diet and controlling my blood sugar levels, but that tough love is what led me to deliver healthy babies after being on bed rest and having a rapidly increasing amount of fluid around my babies. I would definitely say that she is one of the best high risk ob/gyns in Houston. I almost forgot to mention that she replied promptly to my middle of the night first time mom pregnancy pain phone calls to her answering service."

Been to her all of four times and in the beginning she was wonderful. However with the most recent visit my partner was made to feel like she was not doing what was necessary and cause of that she wasn't worthy to be a mother of twins and shouldn't be carrying them. She made it seem as if we were doing something wrong while never telling us that the babies were in danger or not growing as expected. She came across very rude and berating. Her staff is excellent, cheerful and always happy, even her daughter. We were hoping she would be the same. She refused to listen to my partner about her prior conditions and surgeries that impacted/caused limitations. Instead of listening and altering her expectations, she stated ""had I seen you pre-conception I would've told you not to have kids"". If you see Dr Palmer, please get a second opinion. We are changing doctors. She stated ""if u don't like it, you need a new OB"". For once we are taking her advice!"
860,Dr. Sue M. Palmer,Houston,Texas,Gynecologist (OBGYN), Female,8,4.09,2013-10-15T15:50:32Z,5,5,5,5,5,"I was referred to Dr. Palmer by my OB since i developed gestational diabetes. She was sweet and kind and was very clear about what she wanted me to do in order to control my sugar levels. She explained the kind of diet she wanted me to be on, and listened to all my questions and took the time to answer them. Since i am not an american, she even took the time to listen to what kind of food i normally ate, and what it was made of, and explained to me how to maintain a healthy diet while eating my own food. That is something i appreciated very much. She also always made it a point to check my weekly diet and blood sugar records and advised me accordingly. Once, i just emailed my records to her, but she replied the same day with what she wanted me to do. The staff too are friendly and kind and very courteous. I had a very nice experience with Dr. Palmer, and would recommend her to anyone."
861,Dr. Sue M. Palmer,Houston,Texas,Gynecologist (OBGYN), Female,8,4.09,2013-07-30T12:29:30Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Thanks to Dr Palmer I have a beautiful healthy little boy. She not only saved my sons life but my own as well! I think it is important to remember that Dr. Palmer is a high risk doctor . You go to see her because your pregnancy isn't the norm. Sometimes the truth needs to be delivered in a way that patients understand the urgency or severity of their situation. I was told to put on my big girl panties and instead of being offended, I took her advice and did ALL other things she told me and the outcome is a miracle. I am so thankful for her honesty and that she wasn't afraid to tell it to me straight! When I did what she said I was much less stressed and so much healthier. She truly was a miracle worker!"

No other doctor would take me on. Doctor took the best care of me during and after the birth (vbac). Me and my happy healthy six year old have a lot to thank her for. She is very friendly and is very knowledgeable. Would recommend her to anyone.

I even referred him to several friends and family members. After being out of the country for three years I went back to him for my yearly exam. Wow! He was a totally different doctor! He was condescending, rude, obnoxious, and degrading. He answered NONE of my questions. It was so bad that I don't trust the test results because they were submitted by him. A year later and I am still flabbergasted. The worst part is how much I had trusted him."

I used him as my gynecologist for 8 years before using him as my OB when I got pregnant. He has always been thorough and attentive when I bring issue to him. I had a few issues with my pregnancy, and I feel like he always erred on the side of caution, always running tests to find out the problem. The nurses in the office are awesome! They made my pregnancy experience with the office very calming and enjoyable. After 18 hours of labor, I had to have a C section. When my C section incision got infected, Dr. Cooper put me in the hospital as a precaution, which I appriciated. He visited me everyday until I was discharged. I plan on using him again for my second child, no problem!"

He scheduled me to have an ultrasound but told me I'd likely be put on birth control if it was normal. I went for the ultrasound and HAD to make an another appointment and be told everything was normal and to start birth control. When I asked him why I couldn't have received a call he proceeded to tell me he's much too busy for that and he'd be there all night. It took me almost 30 minutes each, 30 wait because he was behind schedule, parking and $30 copay for a 3 minute appt. (i checked the time). At the first appt he already told me what would happen. Dr. Cooper thinks his time is more precious than mine. As a former teacher and school counselor, I spend many evenings calling parents way after hours. I never left people waiting more than 10 minutes. What happen to common courtesy. I know he had me come in so he could bill me. I did let him know how I felt and he shrugged his shoulders."

Then, when I got pregnant I went to him as my OB. Things were great, at first. We found out we were having twins and were thrilled. Dr. Cooper told us at 10 weeks that they were dichorioic/diamniotic twins. Then, I didn't have an ultrasound with him for TEN WEEKS! He only listened to heartbeats but did not do an ultrasound. Well, at 20 weeks we found out we had severe, stage 3 Twin-to-Twin-Transfusion Syndrome, which is deadly to both babies. And it only occurs in monochorionic babies, so obviously, he was wrong when he said they were dichorionic. He NEVER should have let me go 10 weeks without an ultrasound when I was having twins. I trusted him even though I was uneasy with going so long without an ultrasound, I should have trusted myself instead. He's a good doctor, but basically, there are many more doctors that are much better out there."

Cooper's staff was OUTSTANDING! My relationship with his nurses truely made our pregnancy a wonderful experience. Cooper was receptive to all of my concerns by repsonding with questions to asses my answers. Through the pregnancy, even at my 2 week postpartum, he sent me to the lab with a urine sample as a precation of any symptom I had. His induction process for me was optimal knowing I wanted a vag delivery. During the 32 hour process he called and came by frequently to check on us. No sooner did my baby and I show signs of distress, he had us in route for ceserain, even though I was 9.5 cm. He came by before to explain his reasons and answer our questions. I am so greatful for his immediate response, as my fever spiked higher and higher quickly. We trust him completely and will have him deliver our second one in the next few years."

He is compassionate, caring and gentle. If you call his office he personally calls you back. He even gave me his cell and said to text or call, day or night. The only negative is his staff. Going to a obgyn is a very uncomfortable situation, when you are greeted by rude and unhelpful staff it makes it even more uncomfortable and taxing. But if you like the Dr you must over look it. I have referred numerous friends and coworkers to Dr Piegari. He is a great MD."

Surprisingly, he was gentler than any woman I had been to, and he also did not rush the exam. He took the time to make sure that I understood everything and ensured that he answered all questions thoroughly. He did not make me feel any less important than his pregnant patients and made the entire process comfortable. I no longer dread my annual well woman's exam!"

(They could not tell me that my baby was posterior, and that is why I was laboring for days with no progress. The nurse on call also told me that amniotic fluid does not smell, which the nurse in L & D told me was not true.) He told me that I could VBAC for my second, but I had to do it on his timetable. My son had different ideas and lost his calendar, and I was forced into an unnecessary surgery just because the date changed and the doctor didn't feel comfortable waiting, though we were fine according to all of the NSTs I went through and the biophysical profile and my son's 9/9 APGARS. I liked him, but I could never trust him again. My son wasn't quite ready to come out, and we were lucky that everyone was okay."

I feel like the reason she ran late was because she was probably giving everyone the same level of attention as she gave me. She was wonderful and caring and really listed. In addition to my well-woman exam (PAP smear), she also did urinalysis and an STD check at no additional cost. Her staff called promptly with results and also called in a prescription for me.

My original OGA Dr. was too busy cramming in patients to notice that things were very wrong with my pregnancy. Dr. Firpo took over my case, delivered a healthy baby and saved my life. She has always been caring and attentive. She will listen to any of your medical problems and help you or find you a referral for your special needs. I always have to wait too long, but I know that it is because she is listening to patients and helping people, instead of spending 30-90 seconds with you like other doctors do. The general staff at OGA (check in/out, appointments, billing, etc.) are unfriendly and difficult to deal with. But, the staff and nurses inside Dr. Firpo's office are all great.

His images and techniques are impeccable and i cannot think of a better ultrasound.
The benefit with Dr. Kirshon is that he is an MD doing the ultrasound. No an ultrasound tech. He is a experienced physician so you can ask relevant questions and get excellent answers.
Dr. Kirshon is knowledgeable and a good explainer/ listener.
His nursing staff and nice and work well with us. This is supposed to be a miraculous experience so both Dr. Kirshon and his nurses made it well worth it.

I never had a negative experience with his nurse. Dr. Kirshon was friendly and funny. I did feel like I could ask him anything and he would always answer my questions, but he was often in a hurry. I was on best rest for a month and I saw him daily though weekends was often someone else from his practice (all nice, though I did not care for Dr. Hare at all). My one major criticism: he seemed unable to keep my case in his head, and often asked the same questions over and over (including asking 3 times IN THE OPERATING ROOM if we were doing a tubal ligation-we weren't). But upon request he often wrote orders to make my life easier during bed rest (ex removing the heplock, short wheel chair rides etc.). I would not see him again, but partly b/c I would not deliver @ TX Woman's again-they were ridiculously overcrowded in L&D."

I have a blood disorder & my concern was that I'd have a c-sec w/ general anesthesia, not seeing my baby when he was born. When I talked to him about this he said it was very unlikely & I shouldn't worry about it. He also said he had an anesthesiologist that would do an epidural if I did have a c-sec. I ended up needing a c-sec & 30 minutes before they took me back to the operating room they said I would have to have general anesthesia & my husband would not be able to be in the room with me. I started crying hysterically & he wasn't even there to deliver such news. He was running late. While I waited, cold, on the operating table, he came in. He didn't acknowledge me. After our son was born, he came to see me & was warm. He also was quick to see me on my visits after surgery. However, I am very cautious in considering using him in the future."

He and his partners are extremely hard working and dedicated to their practice/patients. His staff is fine - I read multiple complaints about the staff but given the context of the work, the high cost overhead, I found them to be fine. In fact more than fine - they made me feel cared for. A high risk pregnancy means an anxious woman and it is awesome to have the skilled care of someone like Kirshon."

But Doctor is really knowledgeable and helpful in explaining every detail of your pregnancy.

Every one of them has a chip on their shoulder. It is unbelievable that these women could get a job at McDonalds, much less a doctors office. As much as I liked and respected Dr. Kirshon, trust me, it's not worth it."

He told me that my baby would die by week 24 and was very insenstive and rude. I understand he had to deliver bad news but there is a way to state it. He also is not God. It was as if I was that statistic and there was no hope. Well I serve a God who is in the miracle business. I went to get a second opinion from the best doctor in the world, Dr. Alfredo Gei. He is the most compassionate and knowledgeable man around. He saw me every other day even right before the Texans game on Sunday! I delivered at 32 weeks and my baby is healthier than ever and completedly normal. Praise be to God that Dr. Kirshon was wrong."

He delivered my first set of twins and my recovery is going great. He works so hard and such long days, but guarantee he will come and see his patients in the hospital no matter what time of day it is!

They were so kind to me and he helped me figure out what was wrong. The girl helped setup appointments for me for tests I needed and really held my hand through the whole thing...I guess sometimes in life you just need to be cared for and thats how I was treated. I am doing so much better. I recommend this office to everyone.
903,Dr. G. Patrick Solis,Houston,Texas,Gynecologist (OBGYN), Male,5,4.45,2012-11-14T15:16:45Z,3,4,3,2,3,"I read many great reviews and decided to see Dr. Solis based on the great feedback. I found, though, he felt short of his praise. His bedside manner was so-so and he rushed me. At one point, I was still asking him a question in my paper gown and he was literally halfway out the door! Since I am not a doctor, I can't accurately rate his knowledge, but I found much of what he said was counter to what I have heard from other doctors in the past. I need to go back for follow ups to some bloodwork--because I don't think I have a choice--but after that I will be finding another doctor. Plus, his toupee kind of freaks me out."

His staff is wonderful and helpful. Dr. Solis was smart, but very rude. He did not want to answer basic questions I had about my healht. I did not feel like he went beneath the surface about my questions regarding night sweats, how to prevent chronic BV episodes, and which vitamins I should be taking. He lacked patience and was very stereotypical. Dr. Solis asked me how many children do I have instead of asking me do I have any children. I found this to be racially stereotypical question to assume I have children, especially when I do not. Dr. Solis was very rushed for me t be a firs time patient visit. I will not be going back."

He has been more than a doctor by demonstrating compassion when I suffered the loss of my son, and failed pregnancies. He operated on me for endometriosis 33 years ago, ending many years of suffering, after many doctors said just relax and take a tylenol. He corrected a birth defect so that I could have a baby. He took excellent care of me during my pregnancies and did everything medically possible so that I could deliver a living child 16 years ago. He demonstrates compassion and respect, takes time to discuss medical issues, and connects his patients to doctors that can help with issues that are not his field of expertise. I have never had a better doctor! I can't say enough about him to show how much appreciation I have for him and the quality of care I have received for the last 33 years! I am so thankful a friend me to just try one more doctor, 33 years ago! "

I have seen him for over 3 years after my female ob-gyn quit the practice. If you are hesitant to see a male ob gyn - you will not be disappointed by seeing Dr. Yosowitz. He speaks with each patient personally after your visit and gives you a lot of information. You are more than a number in his office. He does not deliver babies or perform surgeries but his wealth of experience is invaluable. He referred me to another doctor in his practice for a surgery he recommends. I trust his judgment and value his opinion. His staff is wonderful - they personally call you after your appointment to give you the results of any tests that you had performed. And you can get an appointment in the same month that you call. I highly recommend him to all.

Beginning with him quite young, I foolishly felt like I didn't know who else to go to and felt ""stuck"" with him. Switched to the most fabulous, competent, gentle ob-gyn, Mary Van Sickle a few years ago, and feel like I went from hell to heaven."

926,Dr. Keith Reeves,Houston,Texas,Gynecologist (OBGYN), Male,3,5,2009-06-02T20:22:23Z,5,5,5,5,5,"This doctor is the apitamy of what a physcian should be. He is very professional as is his staff. The first thing I noticed was no past history forms to fill out in the waiting room. Before he does his examination he does his own interviewing of your past medical history. During the exam, he is very careful to tell you each and every thing he doing or about to do. He even tells you before he touches you. After the exam he sits down with you and explains what he found and the procedures he recommends. I left his office feeling very good about him as a person and a physician."

I had a miscarriage prior to seeing her, so when I chose her to be my OB for a second pregnancy, she was sensitive to my needs prior to ever stepping foot in office. She called me after hours to tell me lab results and put my worries to rest of a second miscarriage, and again, this was before I even had my first visit! It should have come as no surprise that she turned out to be an amazing and supportive doctor all the way through delivery, and beyond. She is confident, knowledgeable, and caring, and truly enjoys building relationships with her patients. I would recommend her without any hesitation - you will not find a better OB anywhere! Her staff is wonderful as well - Susie and Amanda were wonderful nurses! "

He listened to me and took his time during our visits. When I was experiencing gynecological problems but was in another state and under the care of another physician, he called to ensure that I my care was thorough. Additionally, he called me to ensure that I was well. I was seeing other specialists during the event who did not do nearly as much to ensure that I was well.

The nurse asked for a urine sample which I barely gave because I used the restroom. She said it only required five drops for urine. Not pregnant. Then she asked if I had taken Motrin and i said ,No, why.... She looked at me funny. Then the doctor came in . Then started the painful procedure which lasted more than 15 minutes.. That was it .... I was hurting no remorse from her.. As I was leaving the desk nurse kept trying to show me the way out... I was trying to talk to the doctor and nurse but this desk nurse was like a Pitbull throwing me out. Like I was the bad person... Please don't go to her very bad doctor and nurses ...

In explaining to the dr what I had been told by another dr he rudely interrupted me and began laughing. He was extremely insensitive to my feelings and I will never go back to his office.

I had been to two other OB/GYNs but was not pleased with them, so I was still looking. I first saw her at 14 weeks and the visit went great! I didn’t feel rushed. She answered all of my questions and explained everything very well. She has twins also, so I feel more confident in her since she has that expertise. I had to be admitted to the hospital at 33 weeks because I developed preeclampsia. She did a great job of making sure the babies were healthy and helping me understand what was going on. I had a c-section at 34 weeks and everything went smoothly. Even during the surgery, she answered any questions I had and kept me informed of what was going on. I will continue to see Dr. Heiman as my gynecologist. We don’t plan on having any more children, but if we do, Dr. Heiman will be my doctor for that as well. She is a wonderful doctor!"

I saw her pre-baby for birth control, for pregnancy & she personally delivered both of my babies. I have referred 4 friends to her, and they all LOVED her. (3 have had multiple babies with her also & one is post menopause age). Dr Heiman is very approachable, great bedside manner, and has gone above & beyond for me what most OB docs would do for their patients. Dr Heiman also specializes in breastfeeding. She personally contacted & spoke with Dr Jack Newman, a bf'ing specialist (http://www.breastfeedinginc.ca/content.php?pagename=drjack), about my recurring Candida infection in my breasts...which was finally conquered! I believe most docs would have pushed me to give up breastfeeding!!! I highly recommend Dr Heiman if you are looking for a wonderful OBGYN!"

I am dealing with an ovarian cyst and saw that Dr. Heiman specializes in this problem on her website. When I called to get some information, the woman I spoke with was incredibly rude. While I was talking she gave me a very weird and condescending ""um-hum"" and when I asked about the doctor's expertise in cysts, her response was to ask about my insurance.

I provided her with the CT scan information from the ER and she requested another one with contrast and iodine. This doctor actually called me the afternoon of the scan to tell me she could not help me, that I needed to see a general surgeon because I had a mass in my abdominal muscle and that she was pretty sure it was cancer, as this had been the result every time she had seen a mass in this location. After dropping that bomb all she was concerned about was if I was in agreement I didn't need to keep my appointment the next day. She repeated that several times. Of course I sought immediate care with a general surgeon/oncologist only to find out the mass was an endometrioma, something Dr. Heiman as an ob/gyn should have recognized. Her care was clinical, not personal at all. I will never recommend this doctor to anyone. As a ob/gyn, she should have recognized the mass and never told me via phone I had cancer!!!"

She was very down to earth with me and spent valuable time, interest and patience with me each and every time I visited her as well as multiple inpatient visits post-surgery. I found Dr. Luethcke to be highly knowledgeable in her field of OB/GYN as well as her surgical knowledge and skills. After having major surgery performed by her, I was physically able to return to my physically and mental ly demanding job within a weeks time of recovery. I barely even have a scar, due to her additional knowledge of cosmetic surgery, thanks to her popular Houston Dr./Husband, Plastic Surgeon. I HIGHLY recommend Dr. Luethcke for all OB/GYN needs."

I found it very funny cause why would some one take a patient if they can't go all the way. As far as her staff is concerned, I found them little rude and people who never smile. The lady who collects blood samples and draw blood complained about the perfume I was wearing and said its intolerable. But people, don't go here if you want consistency and good service. Also dr. didn't explain us much and gave us a book about what to do and all. i was like we can buy these books in the market out anywhere.

It's true the wait time can be terrible. I learned to always schedule my appointments first thing in the morning so I could avoid having to wait hours for her to be out of surgery. I wouldn't rate a doctor on that, though; to me, what is important is the quality of the care. Dr. Luethcke has a great manner, and I enjoyed seeing her for my gynecological needs. She was great when I miscarried my first pregnancy and when my pap came back abnormal and I had to have cells removed. My experience with my first successful pregnancy was lacking, however. I never felt informed about the process, and I had to remind her of routine procedures that I knew about from reading information online. Many details were neglected or dismissed; for example, my strep test was never recorded and she told me to just remember the result for the hospital. She's a great doctor, but I think she has too much going on."

I know sometimes you might have to wait a while but after all she is the only DR. and sometimes she has to leave to go deliver babies. She is so great that my sister even started seeing her. My moms went with my sister to her pregnancy appoinments andd just loved DR.L She will spend as much time with you as you ask of her. I love her staff and her all are very friendly.

She is amazing! I will agree that her the punctuality is far less than par. She found my mother's breast and uterine cancer and has ALWAYS taken the time to educate my sister and myself. Dr. L has delivered two of my children and in another 7 months, will deliver my third. I feel that some are punishing her with poor ratings because of the hour wait time (which I feel is scheduling's problem).

They also cancelled my appt 4 different times, and no one called me!! i would show up in the office and that's when I would find out after driving over 30 mins to see her. She also would want me to do extra tests on my fetus when it wasn't necessary. When I would question it more, she would never really give me a good reason. If you are looking for a Dr. to take the time during your OB appts, do not go to her. Her staff if so rude too. It felt like a factory there. I changed dr's in my 6 months and have not regretted it! Ask as many questions as possible. When I told the office i was leaving them because of the above issues, they said ""ok"".

I have been going to her for the past 4 years and am sad I did not find her 6 years ago when I first needed an OB/GYNO. Dr. L and her staff are both kind, considerate, patient, helpful, and very knowledgeable. I am so lucky to have found her (actually she was recommended by a friend) Occasionally I will have to wait a few mins longer to see her if I arrive late. Get to your appt on time or a little early. What Dr office do you not EVER have to wait in for a little bit anyway?? While I was pregnant I had a problem and called the office (someone did answer if you dial the correct extension!) and got me in right away with out waiting. YOu have to remember she is an OB as well as GYNO."

She's had ulcers her entire life. She has a lot of scar tissue and needed to be examined to see if a hysterectomy was needed. This so called doctor told my daughter it was her fault because she wasn't active enough and felt sorry for her husband. She also told her she needed hormones and that she should come back in a month. This was the first time my daughter has seen her. So I guess that makes her an expert on my daughter's health. She told her she had parasites and needed to change her eating habits. She sells probiotics and suggested my daughter buy them..
If I had been there someone may have needed to come bail me out of jail. I hope anyone reading this takes heed and doesn't use this person for their needs."

She died the night Dr. Sohner sent her home and said come back on monday. She was completely emotionless when she came to tell us she did not make it and ""these things happen"" she was buried on the day her 1st child was to be born because Dr. Sohner was busy and did not want to come in and deliver her baby. Obviously my opinion of her is not so great. Please choose another doctor "

She delivered my sister and I, 24 & 25 years as go! She has also delivered my two by c section. A lot of people say she has no bed side manners. Thats not the case, she is very professional. I trust her with my life. Almost every female in my family see's her and I have recommended plenty of friends there and they love her! I wouldn't trust anyone else to deliver my babies, she is amazing! Her staff has always treated me so well, and Rhonda (nurse practitioner) is the best person you'll ever meet. All in all, the nurses and Dr. Sohner know their stuff! Smartest women you'll evee come across and I'm forever greatful for them!!"

They forgot I was in the room, and the doctor went to lunch! Then, on my following visit, the doctor run $800.00 test without my knowledge (when I mentioned to her I had a concern months and months ago about something, but has not been an issue for month-and she even assured me everything seems normal) while I thought she was just doing her routine check. When I called and asked to speak with her, I was told rudely she was on vacation, and while trying to resolve this issue with her stuff, when I told them what happened, they said that there was nothing they would do, the test was already run and needed to be paid, and when I got frustrated about them not helping, their response was that this conversation was over and hung up the phone on me. I will not be using this doctor ever again and will always tell people about how rude the stuff is."

I had my son at the end of may, 2012 and dr. sohner did not come in til the last minute at 3:30pm when I had been in labor since 6am the previous morning. I almost died giving birth to my son because instead of being patient she ripped him out of me as soon as his head came out. There was nothing gentle or professional about it and I lost over half of my bodys blood from the force she used. She also pulled my placenta out w/o telling me to push which caused some of it to break off inside and lead to her scraping my insides with her hand for it. While I was bleeding and nurses ran around frantic I asked what was wrong and she refused to answer me. I recently found out she did the same to my neighbor 23 years ago when having her daughter."

I've seen Belinda twice and NOT IMPRESSED. They took an ultrasound and I had to FINALLy call their office 3 weeks later for a result. They have no follow-up with me. If I want to know what my test results are then I have to call them. I'm looking forward to changing doctors in 2011. I've had a few great doctors, a few so-so doctors but on a scale of 1 to 10, I rate this office a 2. They are competent but they just don't really care. I agree with the previous post - we are just $$$'s to them. You basically have to wait an hour to get seen and then it's a 10 minute check-up, bloodwork and no follow up - really? It's sad - I was referred to her but I just can't do this for another year..."

On a well woman check up, I asked her if we could discuss my 14 year old's puberty problems. She was so sweet and diagnosed her as having a potential hormone problem. She squeezed my daughter in for an appointment two weeks later. The diagnosis changed my daughter's life dramatically because of Dr. Sohner. I can't thank her enough for taking the time to listen. I think her quietness causes others to think she is cold but she is caring. I recommended her to a couple of my family members with the warning that she is quiet. They are all pleased with her and everyone love the nurse practitioner Rhonda."

I waited in excess of 30 minutes for my appointments everytime. The first couple of appointments she was good, but after that she was inattentive . She didn't listen to my concerns and on my due date ( I had an appointmnet) she made the nurse practioner see me because she was ""too busy"". She never checked to see if I was dilated over the last few visits and was trying to schedule a c-section for the following week but I requested that I be checked to see if I was dilated, I feel that because of that exam I went into labor within 12 hours. Thankfully Dr. Rodriguez was on call when my son was born,he was awesome and seemed to have experience with big head or large babies (9 lbs and over). I do not recommend her to anyone but would give Dr. Rodriguez 4 stars for bedside manner and ability."

When I did have a question, I had to ask it three times before she was willing to answer it which I found quizzical and frustrating. She was often late and catching her breath when she came in. The very first time I made an appt in fact she was running late, should have gotten the hint then. Usually would have to wait a good amount before the nurse would take me back and then another 30+ min before she came in. Facility can also be updated as well, ultrasound equipment is dated and the pads where you put up your heels for support are dusty gray."

I loved her at first and recommended her to friends who have been through multiple babies with her. they like her. I, on the other hand, have had no pregnancies, and maybe that's the problem. I seem to think my reproductive health and issues in preventing a pregnancy are just as important as the women in the next room who are pregnant or trying to get pregnant, however, I don't seem to get the same time and attention. Years ago she spent lots of time with me talking about my concerns. The last couple of times i've been in, she's spent no more than 4 minutes with me, even when I'm asking questions about changing birth control methods and discussing specific health concerns. her response was, ""read these pamphlets"". I will be looking for a new gynecologist."

There would usually be a large gap between the time the nurse left the room and the time she would come in. She didn't want to answer questions straight on but gave rather generic answers (or would say ""I don't know"") which I found rather confusing/frustrating. I expected my visits to be educational in nature as this is the first time I'm having a baby but came away from most visits with little to nothing actually learned or gained. She is usually running behind and forgetful-- I'll ask her for a pamphlet or some kind of information and will have to frequently remind her for follow-up. Can't reach her outside of actual visits. Disappointed and would not recommend her to others."

Dr.Wynne Duncan has to be one of the very best obgyn docs in Houston. She and her staff provide excellent care and I have always found them to be courtious and professional. She has a busy practice, but takes the time she needs with each patient. I used to see her at her old office and her new office is by far much better, with a much nicer staff. I can't imagine anyone saying anything bad about her, she's one of the few that are still left practicing that truly care about her patients. If anything, she goes way above and beyond to see to it that her patients get the best treatment possible. I once had to see the other doc in her office, Dr.Lloyd, and he too was excellent. I tell everyone I know to use her."

I don't know what the people are thinking that have written anything negative about her. I am probably a super high maintenance patient and she has bent over backwards to be the best doctor I have ever encountered - and I have seen plenty in my life. She is caring, dedicated, compassionate and technically skilled. She is also really sweet. Her staff is always friendly and prompt about returning my calls and or answering questions I might have. I am appalled that anyone would post anything negative about this doctor - but I guess with the internet people can say anything they want."

She has wonderful bedside manners and she was even concerned about cosmetic issues following my c-section. You can't even tell I was cut! Nannette her nurse is WONDERFUL too.

He delivered our first baby and now I am expecting my second one. His staff (Brandi) and himself are absolutely my fav. I trust him, totally.

I had some complications and he took ALL measures to make sure that I would remain healthy and so would my unborn child. That meant me being in the hospital for 6 weeks and bed rest. He came and checked on me and my unborn child everyday. He has a wonderful uplifting attitude towards his patients and I have always felt that you can talk to him and not be rushed. My son was born 8weeks later and I can report that he was a healthy 6lb 8 oz. boy. He is now 33 years old and very healthy.. I owe that all to Doctor B for all the precautions he took for me and my baby!!! I now live in Florida and still fly to Houston for my regular routine check-ups ..Thank you Doctor B! Diane Rampelli

She is very knowledgable, you just have to draw the information out of her. She is very direct, but it is understandable, because she is a doctor. She asks specific questions and seeks a specific answer, not a story. I prefer this in a doctor as it gets things moving along. You just need to be prepared when you go in if you have a few questions. Have a list and be prepared. The bed side manner was a bit rocky at first, but I realized that it was a two way street. The more personable I became, the more personable she became. Sounds like how people actually act. The wait is a bit long, but depends on what you are having done. The longest I have waited is 45 minutes, but sometimes I am in and out in 15 minutes. This is how it is at every doctor. Our family doctor and pediatrician have 30 minute waits as well. My husband really likes her because she is direct, specific, and practical. A good doctor to cut through the drama and worries of the world."

She has a terrible bedside manner and clearly does not want to answer patient's questions. Moreover, when we had some trouble with our pregnancy, she got angry with me for taking up too much of her and her staff's time with questions. I would NEVER recommend her."

She was the first doctor to diagnose the reason for my infertility. She recommended a treatment plan and was very helpful. She always took the time to explain things and never talked down to me. She had to do several surgeries and address complications. Her bed side manner is excellent. I would recommend her to anyone wanting a compasionate doctor.

While I believe she is very knowledgeable I think she sometimes makes her patients feel stupid. I trust her and like her as a doctor but would not recommend her to someone who can get their feelings hurt. She can be very up front and almost too much. Overall great Dr. for the right person.

This was hands down the WORST experience I have ever had with a ""Dr."" She hurt me very badly during the exam, I bled for 3 days after, and then had the nerve to accuse me of trying to nothing more then sue her. She was incredibly late more than 2 1/2 hrs, and staff kept lying about the wait time. I had a Hypoglycemic episode because of the long wait, she simply said it was my fault for not asking for soda or crackers from her staff. At point she threw down her pen and told me she only wanted patients with a positive attitude, because she didn't have to put up with negativity. Dr's are supposed to make you feel better not worse."

I had a pretty rough delivery, she was fine during the delivery part. But I will not be using her again for this pregnancy. I did not feel like I could talk to her or ask her questions. She was always very rushed and never really smiled nor made any type of small talk, and no empathy. When asking questions her reponses would make me feel dumb for even asking the question. She also got very upset with me, borderline yelling, during one of the appts because I didn't call to tell her I thought something might be wrong. Anyways she was fine for the delivery but I will be using someone else I feel like I can talk to."

I have known her for many years. I have been under her care for a variety of OBGYN situations involving two miscarriages and some other uterus conditions. She has always been remarkably patient and thorough throughout with clear and specific explanations to all my concerns. It is your responsibility as a patient to do some research about your situation and concerns beforehand, so that your doctor's appointment will be more efficient and focused. Therefore, I've always been extremely satisfied with Dr. Rivero's keen advice, expertise and kindness."
1054,Dr. Maria T. Rivero,Webster,Texas,Gynecologist (OBGYN), Female,17,3.47,2016-02-25T17:00:09.286Z,4.8,5,4,5,5,"Dr Rivero has been my OB/GYN for 4 pregnancies including my 2nd which was a miscarriage and my last where I had twins. I would trust her with my life and the life of my children which is the most critical element when selecting a doctor. She has always been kind, compassionate, extremely knowledgeable, professional, and extremely experienced having seen all kinds of concern, issues, and types of deliveries. Her quick actions during the delivery of my first child literally saved my life as my placenta had tore, and I was bleeding rapidly. Her nurse had told her she had all my placenta which was not true, and she recognized the signs. She also ensured the delivery nurse was giving enough pain medications early on.
Throughout my pregnancies her concern was for both the health of myself and my baby. She made certain I clearly understood everything regarding any decisions or care. She referred me to specialized care when required (which by the way meant she was not making more money, and it is ridiculous to me that a few of the reviews believe she is making money from more lab tests, hospital visits, or specialist. She is trying to give you the same care she would want for herself and her child.)
She helped me make decisions with my twins on how much bed rest, if I should do a C-section, etc, and I knew she had several other twin pregnancies ahead of mine which gave me comfort. She is very compassionate, but like a good doctor she tells you the truth. She can’t always control the truth or predict the future. It is her job to make sure you understand as much of the truth as she knows based on the best information she has from tests, her knowledge and experience, and exams. It is also her job to help you reduce any risk for your health and the baby’s health.
She has a kind heart to take on a percentage of less fortunate. I feel like some of the lower ratings are because she is caring for less fortunate (where some doctors prefer not to), and they tend to write lower reviews with poor grammar.
Bottom-line: She is one of the best doctors: knowledgeable, professional, compassionate, and kind. She not so compassionate as to hide the truth or let you ignore real risks to feel good. You want your medical doctor to be the best medical doctor when delivering a baby.

Shawn was awesome and the ONLY one who cared to be compassionate to me on my 2nd miscarriage. I know I'm emotional and bitter right now but telling me ""well at least you can get pregnant"" after my 2nd miscarriage is REALLY not comforting. The staff takes FOREVER to return phone calls, the office staff is incredibly rude. They like to ask me what kind of blood work I'm in for even though I have no clue. The miscarriage was painful and no doctor would talk to me. I was just told to keep doing what I was doing. I'm done with the place and would NOT recommend this place to anyone who values their time, would like someone to treat them with compassion or would like phone calls returned in a timely manner."

She is not the most empathic person but the most important is that she is always very aware of any issues during the pregnancy. She is doing all needed tests and if there is anything what she is concerned about she is doing extra tests. I also had a few moments when didn't feel comfortable for 100% with her personality - sometimes asking questions made me nervous but in the end the most important things are her knowledge and professionalism. The most horrible thing about the office is that it always takes sooo long! I always needed to wait for Dr. Rivero in the room for at least 40min. That's too long!

Dr. Rivero has delivered all 3 of my daughters and has been nothing but professional, her bedside manner is perfect! You don't want a doctor who is going to come in joking around and acting goofy, Dr. Rivero has a job to do and that is to keep you and your baby healthy. She orders all of her tests because she is cautious and likes to make sure her patients are all treated to the best of her ability. Every nurse at all the hospitals I have been have all told me that Dr. Rivero is one of the best because she puts her patients first, yes she may have to be rude to a nurse to get what she needs for her patient, remember you are her patient..she is protecting you! Remember she has a job to do and that is to make sure you and your child stay healthy/safe."

Her staff is great except it is impossible to get in touch with her nurse, she does not answer the phone or return messages. It is always a long wait and once you get to see her she is in such a rush and makes you feel stupid when asking questions. Your experience all depends on her mood that day, if she has had a bad day you could leave in tears. She is knowledgeable but it seems like you could find a doctor who knows just as much who also has a much better bedside manner. For the majority her nurses and staff make up for her rude behavior but I will be finding a different doctor for my next pregnancy and would recommend others to save themselves the trouble and go else where."

I was surprised to read some of the other reviews on her. She is a thoughtful and experienced physician. My visits with her both while pregnant and otherwise have been pleasant, informative and thorough. The office wait time was about 25 minutes but honestly what doctor's office is a breeze in and out trip???? I always planned accordingly for wait times but the office staff is great and very professional.
Top 10 reasons I highly recommend this doctor
1. gets you involved and an active participant in your own healthcare
2. active listener
3. quick and efficient but still managed to know me as a person and not a chart
4. easy to schedule appointments
5. phone line for after hour concerns
6. expedient in notifying me of test results or concerns
7. extremely professional
8. excellent bedside manners
9. knowledgeable
10. empathetic and caring"

Scary situation they gained my hard earned money from unnecessary testing !! And had no other options for me and did not speak one word of positivity or encouragement just treated me like a number! I was shocked and definitely upset I wanted to tear the place down Bc that's how dr. A and staff made me feel!! Runn as fast as u can from these ppl u deserve better and these facility, one word sums it up in my mind, TRASH !!"

I went in to the Sugarland location as she works out of two locations and thought the office was very nice and clean and the staff seemed friendly and caring. When I first went back I met with her on my first appointment at 7 weeks and got an ultrasound for confirmation. This however was the ONLY ultrasound I was ever given till my miscarriage in late June. The next time I went in to see her was for a follow up to an abnormal pap in which she listened to the babies heartbeat with a fetal Doppler and although the heart rate in my opinion seemed low she never mentioned she though there was anything wrong nor did she order an ultrasound (10wks). I then needed to go back in for another follow up to the abnormal pap in which I also was NEVER given another ultrasound this had to be at 12wks. After the procedure I experienced mild stomach cramping and discharge from the procedure for about a week. I called in twice and spoke with her nurse Glinda who assured me this was normal after such procedure. After about a week the mild cramping slightly went away but on Monday I experienced a small amount of bright red bleeding. I quickly contacted the office and told them I was coming in frantic that something was wrong. When I arrived in the office I met with the Dr. Amajoh who did exam me and told me that she didn't see any further bleeding. She informed me that the area in where we would need to be concerned about bleeding the uterus there was no bleeding and a small amount of bleeding can be normal. She then listened for the baby's heartbeat again ONLY with a DOPPLER in which she said everything Sounded okay. She told me not to worry and to go home and get some rest. That was the only amount of bleeding I experienced for the rest of the day but then Tuesday I was again plagued with bright red bleeding in which I called in about and was simply told to elevate my feet. By Wednesday the bleeding was still being accompanied by cramping in which every day I expressed my concerns and NEVER was I offered a ultrasound or even informed that the pregnancy could be a threatened miscarriage. The entire week was agony with mild bleeding and cramping till Friday night when the bleeding got really bad and I experienced a full miscarriage. Throughout my pregnancy I asked for there opinion on several things such as my blood pressure ( I had went in to Walmart and had my blood pressure taken and noticed it was high) I brought this to there attention and NEVER did they say it was an issue. They told my blood pressure was normal. The fact that I was only given 1 ultrasound at 7weeks even though I expressed a LARGE amount of concern with abdominal cramping and bleeding. I would never trust this doctor and warn any other mothers to choose wisely because in the END THEY TREAT YOU LIKE A NUMBER ON THE BOOK NOT A TRUE PATIENT IN WHICH THEY CARE ABOUT.

He was late for my first and second appointment. He also cancelled one scheduled appointment for no reason and I later got a call 30 mins from the scheduled time not to show up. The worst part was that this doctor did not listen to my concerns. I specfically told the doctor that I don't believe in genetic testing. He pulled a fast one on me by running a genetic test on me and said he did it on me and not on the baby. If a patient tells you they do not want something, is it right to do the test against the patient's wishes? I called and the lady at the front desk was so rude, i felt like crying.

Not only did Dr. Miller knew exactly what Fertility Awareness was, she one of the most knowledgable people on it I've ever met.

All I can say is if my staff treated my patients the way the Kelsey-Seybold staff treated me I would not be in business. The nurse, Ann, acts like a gate-keeper to keep you from speaking to Dr. Sander. Even when I had vaginal bleeding she minimized my concerns, though Dr. Sander later said I should have had an Ultrasoun. I had a change of insurance for my 3rd visit and called the office 1 week prior to update the info, so that billing could be easier. When I arrived 20 minutes before my appontment they had done nothing with my insurance. I waited 30 minutes and it was still not done. They informed me that a balance on my account had to be pain even though I set up online bill pay to send a check, which seemed too much for them to understand. I asked if I could see the doctor and come back to pay them afterwards and the nurse, Ann, got on the phone and told me I was too late and they had to reschedule (after over 1 hour!!)."

When I started having heavier monthly flows and painful periods, she informed me of my uterine fibroids. A year later, in a followup from the initial ultrasound that identified the fibroids, what was believed to be an ovarian cyst was found. She was adamant about going in. I had the operation a couple of months later and she did a great job. I will agree that she tends to forget those of us who don't go in regularly. She is typically booked a couple of months in advance and has a lot of patients, so if you only see her once a year, so won't remember every detail of your life. This doesn't bother me though. She's very easy to talk to and will stick around and address any questions, fears or issues you have. After my surgery, she checked on my once daily in the hospital. I'd recommend her, even though it will make my wait time for a checkup even longer."

Sander,Houston,Texas,Gynecologist (OBGYN), Female,8,4.05,2009-08-23T23:51:42Z,3.3,4,4,2,3,"Kathy is a very nice lady; however, she did not remember critical information about my specific health issues. She even forgot that she sent me to a specialist on a follow-up visit, which was NOT very comforting as a first time mom. I also spent additional money to go to the ER to have the ER doctor tell me something that Dr. Sanders should have shared with me. Kathy was not helpful in providing insight to what I now believe were common issues in pregnancy that could have been addressed by diet change. It took an ER doctor and a nurse from the Kelsey staff to tell me what could help address my issue, and it did. Kathy is probably great for mothers who already have children, but for first time moms - you should seek a Doctor who will be in tune with your body and help you understand what to expect at each stage. Yes, I have read the books, but insight from my OB-GYN would have been very helpful according to my specific case."

Both pregnancies had issues, and Dr. Sander was awesome. My only complaint is I hate dealing with Kelsey Seybold, and it takes forever to get an appointment with her if you are not pregnant."

I showed up the day I had my appointment and was told that they had tried calling me and left voice mails to I formed me that my appointment was cancel. I never received one call from them.
I so disappointed because I missed a day of work, 2 months waiting for this appointment, and they try to reschedule me in two more months. You can obviously see that they careless about their customers. "

Then another Dr. comes in two hours later telling me Dr. Kirkman went home and that she would be delivering my baby! It took her all of an hour to tell me I was not dilating and that I needed a C-section. THANK GOD kirkman went home and I had a competent doctor delivery my baby. Very scary experience....I have no clue how Kirkman is allowed to be a practicing doctor.

Her staff lost my blood sample and not only did not call me to let me know, but she did not apologize just pointed the finger at someone else. It cost me a office visit fee to find out that there was nothing to tell me because of no tests being run. This doctor is just wasting your time and money."

The wait is unusually long and the staff doesn't seem in any type of hurry or even care enough to apologize about the wait. I would not mind the wait so much had Dr Kirkman been great... but I rarely saw her. On one of the two occasions that I did she smelled strongly of alcohol. I switched Dr's mid pregnancy. Scary.

Otherwise don't waste your time. She is uncaring, incompetent, and fast to tell you to go to the ER if you have problems. Even if the problems are from medications she prescribed to you.

She sent my pregnant wife to a ER next to her practice and we suffered for 6 days at the hospital . She never cheeked on her and also yelled at the nurse because she called her late at night.

I anticipated delivering with a midwife, but after a few labor complications I ended up needing a c-section. Dr Hall was the physician on call and ended up assisting me.

Always either super late or just cancels appointments last minute. At my 20 weeks prenatal appt, she suggested not to bother getting the genetic screening test because results don't come back for another month and by then she says I can't legally do anything about the pregnancy. Truth is, results come back in less than a week and she lied to me. She gave me something to sign without explaining to me what was written on it, and it was actually something that gives the hospital permission to sterilize me. Why would I ever want to do that? All the other obgyn's at Texas Women's Pavilion were booked until next year, including the midwives. Dr Hailey Hall was the only one left available. Now I know why."

She lacks compassion, never addresses the patient by name, she certainly lacks basic bedside manners. There is always a very long wait time, almost always exceeding an hour, and she never apologizes for the delay. She doesn't have a nursing staff of her own, and as a result, phone calls or emails to her are never returned. She is the only OB I know who doesn't perform ultrasound scans of the fetus after the 20th week, despite my repeated inquiries about this. My baby was born with an undiagnosed medical condition which, according to the care team in the NICU, could easily have been caught on a 28th or 32nd week scan. Needless to mention, this is a very costly mistake.
A pregnancy is a special period in a woman's life and one would want utmost care from their physician at this time. Dr. Hall fails to meet the least of these expectations. Texas Children's Pavilion for Women is an excellent facility with top-class amenities. Just as long as Dr. Hall isn't your physician!"

I have recommended her to my friends, whom I've gotten good feedback. As I read some of the comments, I am very surprised that some have commented on her rudeness. She always receives me with a warm hug when greeting me. Very thorough and has great bedside manners for a doctor. The wait time was ridiculous, which I pointed out to her and she said they are working on that. Although, surprised, I believe any rudeness could be coming from being overworked. "

The office seems to always be in a state of chaos & this has caused some scheduling/wait time issues. Contacting Dr. Hall or her staff can be difficult due to these issues.

Dr. Hurtado helped me figure out some hormonal imbalances, does not treat superficially, and has stepped in where my endocrinologist fell short. Her staff has always been responsive and kind. As some others have mentioned here, the wait times are consistently on the long side, but I agree that to work with her is well worth the wait.

Always in a hurrty that she didn't detect I had an incompetent cervix and an infection at week 25; I almost lost my baby. Asked if I could travel to Mexico; she allowed it and turned out I ended up being put on bedrest and giving birth in Mexico. Thanks to the amazing doctors in Mexico, stayed on bedrest in the hospital for 4 wks, they were able to prolong the pregnancy until 29 weeks, then my baby girl was born.

There were definitely times when I wanted to ask Dr. Moss questions that I felt rushed or like I didn't get a complete answer and was beyond frustrated, but over my several visits I built a relationship with her and also got to know a softer side of her. My advice: be ready with questions and be willing to be direct (especially with a first pregnancy). I was often in and out while others were still sitting in the reception area waiting to be seen by their doctor, which I appreciated!"

Being my first pregnancy id had many questions. She answered all of them so vaguely and walked out when i was still asking. I had a problem after birth which she brushed off and said itll fix itself. First told me it wasn't there then i showed her it was and she gave me that response. Its been almost 3 months and still not resolved. This dr office also never answers the phone except for scheduling. You must call multiple times leave multiple voicemails, emails thru patient portal for them to take weeks to reply, this was for medication and other things. Dr moss had terrible bed side manner and never showed any concern for my problems or questions, even laughed at my legitimate concerns, which i had no idea about somethings in pregnancy and felt like a slap in the face when i asked and she laughed.

My sister who was with me stopped her when she touched my private parts to ask what she was about to do and she responded abruptly and rudely, ""A pap-smear... who are you, her mother??"" This doctor was not happy that I had questions about my body, had no concern for the reason I was there - which was bleeding while 9 weeks pregnant. She rushed through every answer, cut her eyes and left the room as soon as possible. Whether it was a terrible day for her or this is just who she is, I will not be returning to her and I certainy do not recommend her at all. "

I cannot say enough about the staff at this hospital. Every single person I came into contact with went above and beyond to ensure the comfort of myself, my family, and my babies. I believe that every person I came into contact with is an angel of some sort, and I'm so grateful I chose Dr Moss and her amazing team! As ""joyful"" as OB visits are, I look forward to my visits with her. Her staff is always prompt and courteous, and we always have something to chat about- whether it be food cravings, kids, travel, and medical concerns- she delivers practical advice, she's a straight shooter, and her bed side manner is wonderful!

Dr. Ortique delivered both of children. And now I am expecting my third child and I am waiting to change insurance to GO BACK to Dr. Ortique so she can deliver my third baby. Listen if you are looking for a babysitter doctor........Dr. Ortique is not that doctor. She is a doctor that KNOWS her stuff and she is straight forward and she lets you know what you need to do to have a healthy pregnancy. My first pregnancy was smooth with slight complications that Dr. Ortique got under control. NOW my second pregnancy let's just say Dr. Ortique showed me right than that I choose the BEST doctor for my pregnancy needs. Through out my second pregnancy I needed to be hospitalized and needed surgery during my pegnancy. Dr. Ortique checked on me through out my stay. She has great bed side manner. She truly cares about her patients. I thank Dr. Ortique for delivering my two angels!!!!

I can say initially I was a little put off by her due to the fact that I have a big personality and she is very quiet and mild. I had my first visit with her when I was 4 weeks pregnant. She did take the time to talk with me in her office and get my history and background of my family. Over time she has really grown on me! I am now at 40 weeks pregnant (3 days overdue). She has always asked me what I wanted to do before assuming that her way was the best. If I didn't have an answer then she would tell me how she does it normally. If I asked her a question that she didn't know the answer too she took the time to look it up. I never felt rushed in any way - and regarding the comments of those who said she was rough - I have yet to be in a GYNO's office where any of it felt good! I am looking forward to delivering with her in the next few days! (I gave a low punctuality score due to the fact that she did have babies to deliver when I had appointments!)

I am not pregnant yet but I can tell that she is thorough and knows her stuff. We got in on the day after the 4th of July and she still took time to have a sit down consult and do my annual. I did not experience any pain. I will make sure that I follow any guidelines she gives. I already trust her. She answered all of my questions.

She was so sweet and loving, she asked about our family and we felt right at home at Texas Children's Women's Pavillion, she explained everything well and made jokes to ease the stress. We loved every moment and we were not rushed like others have stated. She did my utlrasound and gave me plenty of samples to choose from of prenatal vitamins and the nurse was very nice, the blood work employess from Quest were nice and my experience was amazing, I can't wait until it's time to deliver, I know I will feel very comfortable. Dr. Ortique, keep doing what you do best....."

Unfortunately, I had this person as my doctor and my daughter was born 3 months early because this person did not take the time to acknowledge the signs I was experiencing. This person mad me feel like a new mom that didn’t know anything. I went it to the ER and she did not even come to my bedside to release me. When I asked why the pain was so sever she said I’ll give you pain meds and you will be fine. Later that night I delivered a 2 pound daughter that was in the NICU for 96 days and has had had 9 surgeries due to being premature. I wish I would have had the guts to change doctors. I tried giving her a chance but she was rude and in a hurry at each visit. I pray that nobody will trust her with your life or your baby!! **Sad that you ask how much I had paid. I can not put a price on what we have paid."

We were very surprised to find that we were having twins which was totally missed by the doctor during three previous ultrasound and were told that we were having only a single baby. well with all this it was but natural for us to change the doctor.

I had my well woman check and had to terminate my other form of birth control first. I cannot get a call back. I cannot get them to schedule an appointment. I'm not sure if she's morally against birth control, or against it because I'm unmarried. I've resorted to finding a place on the internet where I can order birth control. I will never be back. I'm also angry that I now have to pay money to go find another OB-GYN to prescribe me birth control because I cannot get her to return my phone calls. I'm considering filing a complaint with the medical board if I still can't get a call back next week. "

She is very friendly and knowledgeable. I was a little upset about the fact that i didn't meet her until my 4th appointment after being told i would meet her at my 2nd appointment. Her staff is terrible. It took me almost 3 months to book an appointment with her. I was constantly told that they would need to talk to her before they could book me and that they would call me back. I NEVER got a call back. Every time i called, i was told i would be put on a list but when i would call back to check up they didnt have any of my information i had already given. If it wasn't that my sister in law had recommended her, i would have gone somewhere else. Expect to have to call several times to get test results because they do not call you. The staff is very unorganized. The wait time is much longer than any other doctors office i have ever been to."

They lack customer service skills, frequently violate Texas Privacy laws when discussing patient information on the phone well in the hearing range of patients waiting in the reception area.
His cash-based policy is certainly within the law but allows for no flexibility...his surcharge on credit cards is not allowed in Texas so he might want to discontinue that practice."

I am upset; however, that he no longer accepts any insurance except for Medicaid. This is a major inconvenience for me and I am forced to find another doctor. I find this very upsetting. I am not willing to pay the full cost of seeing this doctor and then be reimbursed after my deductible is met. That is why I chose an insurance plan with a copay, to not have to deal with this sort of thing. I imagine Dr. Birkin will lose alot of patients. Then again, maybe he only wants his ""cosmetic"" patients anyway."

First off, Dr. Mott doesn't listen to anything her patients try to tell her, she constantly over-talks the patient. And secondly, she sent my wife to her friends(other drs) that didn't even understand why my wife was being sent there. She had my wife getting treatments that WORSENED her condition, and required her to be hospitalized, and that was unacceptable!!! Thirdly, the staff is HORRIBLE and SHARON(nurse) is the worst person, in any medical profession, that a patient should have to rely on to get information from. They NEVER answer the phone and when Sharon gets info from you she never relays any information to Dr Mott and vice-versa, nor does she give the patient accurate info. SHARON constantly gave my wife OLD info that was discussed 2 months ago with previous office visit!!! And if you need to get someone on the phone to ask a question.......FORGET ABOUT IT!!!! The only way they'll communicate with the patient is through email. They won't call you back if a message is left for a call-back. And even if you get an appointment, take off the whole day because an office visit is easily 3-4hrs!! We went to see this dr for 9mos....yes 9mos, and never was able to get her surgery completed. They couldn't even fill out my wife's FML paperwork, because they were so busy!!! Finally, my wife had enough and we were recommended another doctor, by a doctor that was APPALLED by my wife's condition not being taken seriously. We visited The Woman's Hospital and after only 1 office visit, surgery was scheduled AND COMPLETED within 1 MONTH from the FIRST office visit!!!!!!! It's unbelievable to me how so much TIME and MONEY was wasted at Dr Mott's office with ZERO communication, that kept my wife's health at risk!!!! Dr Plavidal at The Woman's Hospital was AWESOME AND RESPECTFUL!!!!!!!! If you call Dr. Plavidal's office, an actual PERSON answers the phone!!!! Maybe Dr Mott is better if you're pregnant, but don't waste your time at her office if you just need a simple procedure done(fibroids)!!!! Pregnancy must be MUCH more cost effective to her bottom line!!!!"

She believes in getting to know the patient inside out, spending time with them like they are her only patient. In an OBYGYN, this is exactly what I wanted. Someone who takes time to get to know me, listens patiently to my questions and concerns, carefully addresses all of them, formulates a plan of action based on my needs, both medical and otherwise. Wait times are long - the person scheduling the appointment tells me upfront that I will wait a long time because Dr. Mott never rushes through an appointment. I come prepared with books and a laptop. I trust Dr. Mott completely, knowing I'm in very good, very experienced hands. Highly recommended without reservation."

Last minute appointment cancellations (day of). Staff do not answer the phone. Staff shows no compassion and customer service is very poor. Dr. Mott caters more to pregnancy patients....

She is outstanding, she is my bar for any physician I choose to care for me. She demonstrates care, compassion and knowledge that make me feel confident in any advise she give. She is the only doctor that has hugged me when greeting me and always has the last question . ""Is there anything else you need from today?"" When you are with her in an exam room you have her full attention. If you require more time or personal attention she will give it to you. Sometime she has to deliver a baby or another patient requires more attention and I may have to wait. Her staff is prompt in telling me what is going on and will give me an opportunity to return or wait. I feel like that the same attention is given to me, in my time of need.
When I chose her in the mid 80's, I was 32, I told her"" I want to grow old with you caring for me."" She smiled and said I hope so also. I turn 62 this year, I see her annually and travel from where ever we are living to do so, from Damascus, Calgary, Colorado Springs and now Paris. "

Additionally, the test cost $700, which is excessive for a urine screen. Also, her staff was extrememly uncooperative in releasing information to us after we switched doctors, and were extremely unhelpful and in getting me the perscriptions I needed while I was a patient there. Since we were required to pre-pay for her services, we are now also having trouble getting the unused portions of our money back so we can apply it to the new doctor. All in all, Dr. Nguyen has a pleasant bedside manner, but do not expect that to transfer into the business side of your medical care or expect her to observe your rights as a patient."

The office wait time is rarely ever long and she is very thorough and spends time with you at each appointment. Her staff is awesome. She was my OB during my second pregnancy and delivered my baby girl in March; she took the time to know what kind of birth I was hoping for and is very supportive of natural birth (as is the whole practice and the hospital). When baby time came she showed up to deliver her at 1:00am even though she was not the on-call doctor that day because she knew it was important to me. After an all-around horrible experience with my OB when I had my son, I could not be happier with the medical care I received or the hospital and birth experience and would recommend her to anyone and will definitely see her for routine Gyn care and any hypothetical future pregnancy."

Dr. Wiener was extremely nice and down to earth. I had a lot of questions and she took the time to answer all of them. I was able to talk very openly with her and did not feel uncomfortable.

I went to three other doctors because my pain kept getting worse and I couldn't get off birth control to work with my local fertility specialist( we've been trying to get pregnant for three years). Dr. Mangal has been a life saver. Yes, you have to wait a long time. Yes, his staff is often disorganized. Yes, he does talk a lot but is very friendly and answers my questions when I call him on it. With a scope and open surgery he removed three grapefruit sized cysts and saved my right ovary from the middle of a cantalope sized cyst after two other doctors told me that ovary was dead. He is passionate about surgically removing endo, which is what I needed, and his bowel colleague Dr. Mathias has eliminated my painful bowel movements with diet, vitamins, and meds. I've come from two states away for these appointments, and I am continuing them for the two years recommended. I woke up from my last surgery and could breathe without endo pain for the first time in twenty years. I am so grateful. I recommended my sister who also has endo to see Dr. Mangal, and her experience so far has been excellent, too. We both have had intentional follow up from him personally in returning calls. When I got off the plane in Houston for one appointment, I had a missed call. I thought it was my husband- but no- Dr. Mangal checking to see how I was doing! On a Saturday! At 10 pm! Cannot beat his level of dedication and compassion! I feel blessed to be on his caseload after the misery of my previous experiences with doctors ignorant of my condition or lacking the knowledge or skills to assist. Dr. Mangal is the best!"

The endometriosis surgery he was extremely thorough and left minimal scarring. I had to have part of my colon removed and endo scraped from other organs, he also to the appendix out and straightened by tilted uterus. I wish I had known about him sooner I wasted time and probably made my condition worse by seeing two other doctors before him.
IVF was more stressful as nothing seemed to run on time and clear expectations weren't set up about the timeline .
Hang in there!!! It definitely got better at the end and it worked! We only had one embryo but I'm not pregnant with our first baby and all thanks to this doctors dedication and talent. "

I saw him and watched the video then was unable to pursue surgery due to my car falling apart and my crazy work schedule. I was able to get in to see him in September and quickly scheduled a surgery for last week. He not only found endo everywhere (I've had stage 4 endo for 4 years) but he also found a tumor that had been there for around 15 years.
Anyway, unfortunately for me (but fortunately in the sense that I'll be having my endo removed) I will be having a fully extensive surgery soon. I need to have a bowel resection along with endo removed from my bladder. That's just part of what will be done. However, Dr. Mangal is a Godsend for me. Dr. Mangal is an instrumental part of my life and me being pain free soon. My husband looked at me after surgery and said ""after seeing those pictures I finally understand the pain you've been in. I'm so sorry."" I've met so many women in the past couple of weeks who have had surgery wth Dr. Mangal who remain pain free years after ther surgeries. It is so exciting to me to hear that.
Definitely see Dr. Mangal, he is wonderful at what he does. "

Yes, he has a lot of patients book for the initial appointment. He receives tons of referrals from his colleagues. You will watch a video that explains your issue in laymen terms. He will do tons of test to collect as much data as possible. He will use all this information and present you with an action plan. I had surgery two weeks ago. I feel like he is very detailed oriented and does his best to do what is best for each individual patient. "

I live 6 hrs away and I was actually referred to him by my fertility specialist. And his flat out honest opinion was, "" I could do the surgery, but in all honesty, I believe Dr. Mangal will do a much better job and he will reconstruct you and leave you like brand new"". No doctor was willing to work on me for fear of hemorrhaging to death! And I can say this, ""As God Almighty is my witness, Dr. Mangal not only gave me hope, but he gave me my life back""! I feel FREE! I feel great! After 2 1/2 years of misery and pain, after my local ER denied I had anything (after a CT), they performed an appendectomy, and still denying I had multiple masses as per CT report (that I only recently requested)!! Dr. Mangal successfully removed 5 uterine fibroid tumors, largest being 6'' big (grapefruit size), 4 oranges and a lemon... detaching my uterus from my stomach, removed tons and tons of scar tissue and had a partial hysterectomy, SUCCESSFULLY! I MADE IT! I'M ALIVE! BECAUSE OF DR. MANGAL!
Yes we watched a video, yes at times there was a wait, but when he had me in a room all his attention was on me and my PAIN! He is very compassionate and caring. The video helped my husband understand that my pain was REAL! After we left he cried and begged for forgiveness... because he had no idea what was going on. Dr. Mangal also called me at home on several occasions to explain his findings and what to expect from surgery. He actually explained my surgery 3 TIMES on the phone because I was in shock, but he was so patient with me and just explained again. He worked with scheduling my appointments to accommodate our schedule and finances. I had a bit of trouble with my insurance on my first visit and he did what was needed to give me 5 days to do what my insurance was asking before he gave me a bill. The girls at the front desk were always so welcoming and sweet. His insurance staff (Claudia) was on the phone for hours speaking to my insurance. And still when I finally got to her she wasn't frustrated or upset, she was so sweet! She told me exactly what I had to do once I got home. And her and her manager even helped us by giving us a map with directions to a restaurant, since we're not from Houston. Just super NICE STAFF! And last but not least, Angela.... she has become very dear to me. She is so nice and has such a big heart. I called her sooooo many times and she always helped me with a kind spirit.
After my surgery, as we were getting closer to home, I see the palm trees and I began to cry. I looked at my husband and I told him, ""We did it.. Dr. Mangal did it.. I'm coming home tumor free.. I'm alive"".... And I've cried so many more times, because I'm so blessed. And if I had to do it all over again, I would do it all the same... I would drive 6 HOURS away to Houston to see Dr. Mangal!
My husband made a plaque for Dr. Mangal that reads:
Good doctors like you aren't always the ones who have fancy degrees and qualifications. They are the ones who have a big heart and a burning desire to make the world a better place. One patient at a time... Thank You
We will be giving it to him this Wednesday at my post op appointment. And I must say, it's going to be a bitter sweet departure.... "

(I for one believe every word of the ""not recommended filtered review.)
You will wait 6 hours in his waiting room--no matter what time your appointment is.
His staff is HORRIBLE. It's not completely their fault--he does these cattle-calls to see any many patients at once (and, i now think this is to perform as many surgeries as possible--for the $$$). Angela, who is either a nurse or a nurse practitioner handles ALL of them. They mix up appointments constantly, and are always rushing to get you out of the exam room.
That's right, most of your first appointment is not an appointment at all, but you and eight other women (many of whom bring their husbands) watching videos in a room while Dr. Mangal does something else somewhere else.
While giving me my pelvic exam, this doctor took a call on his cell phone. At first I thought maybe it was an emergency---but it was not. Mindless chit chat. My naked vagina, feet in the stirrups, and this guy chatting away on his cell.
The last thing, the thing that really gets my goat, is that things (pain, and new horrible symptoms) have been so much worse since my surgery and Dr. Mangal doesn't give a crap. Angela (Dr. Mangal will never call you back. Only Angela) says it's normal for pain to be worse for many months after surgery, which might be true, but it would have been nice to know this BEFORE the surgery. I had no idea how bad it would be.
The pain was so different and so much more severe that I almost went to the emergency room. I'm not used to having pain IN MY FEET so severe that I cannot walk on them while menstruating. So new and exciting. A heads up would have been nice.
I've been trying to get a hold of him for weeks now, to get documentation for why I've been missing work every month (the increased symptoms which his nurse says, over the phone, are normal but for some reason it's impossible to get a work note stating this) and no dice.
Once this guy sews you up and sends you home, he doesn't care what happens to you. That's great if your surgery actually helps, like the person who wrote the other review. I'm very happy for her, as I know how hard it is to have female reproductive diseases dismissed over and over again (please see my review of just such a gynecologist, posted a few years ago). Unfortunately, if the first surgery doesn't fix everything and you need *anything* after your 5 minute post-op visit, tough cookies.
One positive thing I can think of is his bedside manner--he is polite. This is a personal preference: but I'd rather have a rude doctor who actually cares what happens to his patients after surgery.
There *are* good doctors out there, ladies! They are hard to find, but they are out there. I intend to keep looking."

His office staff was wonderful. He was thorough, though his bedside manner could be off-putting. He's smart but knows it & flaunts it. He made some assumptions that I had to correct. Overall though, he was sensitive and confident, which is good in an OBGYN. I just had to remember to be firm and tell him when I disagreed."

He makes assumptions on where I'm from and my lifestyle and can speak condescendingly( which I find funny) , but he knows his stuff technically and explains what he's doing. I don't like that he seems to be drug happy , but I've let him knows boundaries & he has agreed to work within my realm of comfort.
May still look for another doc if he continues to push theories on me that aren't backed with enough clues to make it conclusive but we shall see! His staff is the best!"

I was floored at several if the inappropriate comments made by this doctor. In addition he was very condiscending and rude. I have never in my life been so humiliated by a doctor during a routine check up. I discussed this behavior with some if his other patients who agreed that he had treated them the same way even making one friend cry! I will not be seeing him again.

After countless hours in many OB offices which always resulted in,""I'll never be able to have my own children."" I now have two healthy beautiful baby girls (3&1). Never once did he put me on fertility meds it was another issue keeping me from conceiving. He found I had PCOS,Insulin Resistance, Endometriosis and a thyroid issue. After putting me on the appropriate medicines and having a laparoscopy he suggested I got pregnant a month later! He takes the time with you and never makes you feel like you're not important, which also applies to his office staff! He is the most compassionate Dr I've ever met and am very thankful for him!"

He has never once made me feel like ""just another patient"" his bedside manner and personal touch is something i have never found in antoher Dr and I truly cherish all my memories of time spent in conversation with him not to mention the actual births he attended. I intend to contact him again even though i am over 2000 miles away about posible IVF.

He took me as an OB patient during my 7th month of pregnancy, something that most OBs refuse to do. He was adamant about not attempting a VBAC, which gave me pause because he came highly recommended from other women whom he delivered vaginally after previous c-section deliveries. He was always willing to chat with me and answer my questions, which is a big plus for me. While I was in the hospital after the birth, he stopped by a couple of times a day to check on me; I am sure that is expected, of course, but how many doctors actually do that? Overall, I think he is a great doctor and is still my GYN to this day. Several of my friends and two of my coworkers are his patients; one of my co-workers has been going to him for over 20 years."

My first time meeting Dr. Fisher she and her staff were so kind and professional. I'm 30 years old and started having incontinence. I had to do something so I chose her based on online reviews and how friendly she seemed.
I am so thankful that I did because she found something cancerous that was putting pressure and causing the incontinence. She went above and beyond to get me into more testing without needing to wait to be scheduled.
She spent hours with me that day doing everything she could to try & get all my testing and examinations done. She was able to refer me to a wonderful team at MD Anderson where I am currently a patient. I've since had my surgery & am fully healed and on the right track to being 100% again."

After exams spending time to explain any health issues and won't let me leave until I feel comfortable with everything. He's given us his pager and cell phone number to contact him.

I have seen him annually for my well-woman checkups all these years, and I really dread the day he tells me he is retiring. He is always friendly, calm, personable and professional. He returns my calls personally most of the time and he has given me his pager # which he timely responds to if I call. He always spends plenty of time with me answering questions, and he is extremely knowledgeable and up to date on the latest medical procedures and info. About 10 years ago, he gave up his private practice and joined a University Medical Program in order to give back by doing research and being a teaching Dr. He still has a partial practice there.

I had a c-section, spent 9 days in the hospital after and promised myself that once she discharged me I would never see her again.

I was sent to her by my OB because of an abnormal test result on my AFP Tetra Scan. We were told our baby was fine & not to be alarmed, it was just a precaution.
That was not the case though, and Dr. Hare was horrible. She did not speak the entire ultrasound, and when she finally did, she basically told us our daughter was sick & was going to die, and we needed to have an Amnio. I was 25 at the time, and she treated me like I was an ignorant, 12 year old child who shouldn't be having a one. She then waved us away to a genetic counselor where we were given the option to terminate, or get an amino.
Luckily, a friend referred me to Dr. Kirshon so I did not have to see Hare again. He delivered the same blow, just softer and with more compassion.
Unfortunately, my daughter was very sick, and 3 weeks later I delivered her stillborn.
But needless to say, I would never recommend Dr. Hare to anyone. She gave up on my child while she still had a heart beat, and she had no bedside manner in the least bit.
Worst experience of my life. Even worse than hearing that my daugher did not have a heartbeat "

I followed her practice to her new location which is almost an hour drive for me, however i find it worth it. She's caring and has excellent bed side manners. She also knows what insurances will pay for so she's reluctant to order meds that are out of the ordinary. She will take her time to answer or discuss all my questions, a quality most other physicians lack. Her office staff seems to be still in training and would benefit from feedback."

She understands so much more than any other doctor I have seen. I feel she has given me my life back. My energy is better than it's been in years and she brought my cancer risk down.

The staff is surly and untruthful. Each visit is a horrible ordeal. I would not go at all except the doctor (when you finally get to see her) does know bioidenticals. The care I receive is not as good as it could be because it is so unpleasant to go to the office or even call. Sometimes I have waited for two hours and then not seen the doctor at all. Each visit raises my blood pressure. If you go, bring a drink, a meal, and a long novel, you'll be half way through War and Peace by the time you see the doctor.

I got pregnant right after that and I got to see her 3 times tops before I hit week 36. I was never given pictures of my ultrasound because ""paper is too expensive"" and they have the oldest ultrasound equipment EVER! She makes you wait for at least 40 min and talks to you for at most 5! She never remembers you even if you come back every week.
On my 39th week she induced me naturally I n her office and promised that if it didn't work she would induce me 2 days later at the hospital. I never received her schedule confirmation call. When I came in to the hospital, I was not even in the list, they didn't have my prenatal records and I WAS SEEN BY AN O/C DOCTOR BECAUSE SHE WOULD BE OFF SINCE THE DAY SHE PROMISED TO INDUCE ME!

I had the worst experience, She has made me wait 45min-1hr for almost all visits and after such long waits she hardly spends any time, was very rude and and not willing to answer any questions. She is very rude to her own staff as well. It seems like she is always looking for ways to make money through c section, since that's what i ended up having even though i had no complications through out my whole pregnancy. Guess what, she makes you pay a huge amount upfront and after my unplanned c section I realized why.

They marked me as a ""no show"" at 3:54pm (9 minutes after my appointment time). The last time I saw this provider was on 07/19, I was supposed to see her on 08/10 but they cancelled that appointment. Then they rescheduled my 08/30 appointment to 08/23 and I was flat out refused being serviced that day. So I have not seen a provider since 07/19 for my prenatal care and I'm currently 34 weeks pregnant. Both the front desk girl and office manager confirmed that they do have a 15 minute grace period policy and I arrived at the office well within that grace period. I have already filed a complaint with the Texas Medical Board to investigate this provider and her practice because they refused seeing me without proper explanation and documentation and they failed to give me proper prenatal care as my obgyn.

Having to deal with Sherri and Monica (office manager) in this clinic was a horrible experience. They demanded a fee in order to have the doctor sign my employer's maternity leave request form. Let me clarify, all the doctor needs to do is SIGN the form and they demanded a fee to do that. After talking to Sherri who was very rude I asked to be transferred to a manager and I was transferred to Monica. I left her a very detail message explaining the issue I'm having, how rude I was treated by her staff and how upsetting I am having to go through this being 7 and a half months pregnant. She called back hours later, did not apologize, did not even acknowledge she had received my voicemail. After asking to speak to me all she said was ""this is Monica calling you back from Dr. Jemelka office, how can I help you?"" With this kind of attitude, they don't need to be working in this profession dealing with pregnant woman. I like the doctor, after seeing her for the first time I was planning to transfer all my prenatal care to her not only for this baby but future pregnancies. Obviously, I'm not going to do that now if this is the treatment I’m getting from her office staff. I NEVER EVER have to pay a fee to have a doctor sign a sick leave form for my employer, EVER!

This is my first child and I had a lot of issues early on in my pregnancy. She has been very calming, caring and reassuring during my 7 1/2 months of seeing her. Because of my pregnancy issues I have seen her more than most pregnant women would have to see their doctor and with all the visits I have had with her I can say with certainty that she 100% deserves the high rating I am giving her."

They don't return calls. The wait time is awful. I was told my personal business in front of the entire office. No one had time to talk to me, so the woman in the front office tried to hold what should have been a private conversation in front of everyone in the front office. She even slid both windows back to make sure I saw and heard her.
I have been a patient for a very long time, and this is the most unprofessional front office staff he has had.
I am very disappointed in Dr. Barnett for allowing his office staff to act in such a matter. They represent you Dr. Marcus Barnett!"

I remember being nervous about moving to Houston and having to find a new doctor. I went in for one of my regular doctor's visits (3 weeks from due date) and Dr. Barnett noticed my daughter had flipped back around in a breach position. I was asked to go directly to the hospital and he'd meet my husband and I there. I had to have an emergency c-sect, but the best part about it all was Dr. Barnett prayed just before starting my procedure. Being a Christian woman; that meant so much to me. My daughter is now 12 and I still tell her stories of how great my pregnancy experience was."

He made me feel very comfortable with the pregnancy and let me know exactly was going on at every moment. I was 16 when I had her and not scared at all. My second child was with a doctor in Hawaii and in a military hospital. I hated it. I would have given anything to be able to Have Dr Barnett out there with me for number 2.

Waiting time was always more than an hr. Even though I was a schelduled c-section she did not sent me to the anesthesiologist to get the necessary pain management. I had to go through very last contractions to the point where I was feeling the pressure of the baby coming out. Even after the c-section half of my incision did not close and was left open like a big gash wound.It was still oozing fluids went to her at 2 wks to show it and she said its normal, She sees it all the time and sent me home.She didnt do anything to close it even though I specifically asked her what she can do to fix it.At 6 weeks still open and oozing, by this time the open flesh started to hang out, i was seen by another doctor in the group who was shocked that nothing was done for my incision and recommended that I see a sugeon right away.It was only by Gods grace that my incision did not get infected by leaving it open for so long."

I'm shocked at some of the reviews from years ago. I remember the long waits and the multiple waiting rooms at the old office, however most of my memories of waiting were because she was delivering someone's baby. I had a very difficult but safe first delivery that required a lot of Dr. Bobo's time. She was so compassionate and I would trust her with my life again (and did with a less stressful second delivery). She prioritizes her patient's lives and doesn't rush their laborntonfit a normal workday schedule. All the nursing staff at labor and delivery that I interacted with like her a lot and many had very complementary things to say about her as a person and as a doctor. I found her practice by asking a friend who had just finished a ObGyn rotation in her residency who was the OB that my friend would want to work for/with from all the physicians she had observed. In my opinion, her ratings should be much higher because her care and skill are top quality. "

She delivered my first-born was very attentive and helpful throughout the process, even personally calling another doctor (perinatal) to schedule an appointment for us. She has a good heart and truly cares about her patients. As for those complaining about the wait time, yes, it can be a bit disappointing but many OBGYN offices with a reputation for excellent care are busy that way. It has to due with the many directions and the time they spend with patients. Sometimes they are literally running to surgery to care for another. I do not hold that against this office at all."

Even the wait time for appointment in the office is very unreasonable. I have continued to go to her because its very convenient but I have had enough. Who ever is managing this office needs to be fired. I have worked in doctors office in management for over 30year and do know how an office should be structured this office needs a complete overhaul.

She puts her patients first and is a very compassionate doctor. She is very popular- which means she can be busy at times. I have been going to her office for 3 years now and think they have gotten much better at time management. If there is a hiccup in the schedule, it is because she goes out of her way to deliver her patient's babies. I am very happy I know who delivered my son! I would highly recommend her! "

I found Dr. Bobo's style to be completely paternalistic and confusing at the same time (a really strange mix, I know!). She would give me contradictory opinions at the same appointment and would get very defensive by me asking a question to try to clarify what she wanted me to do. I won't go into the specifics of my medical care, but I believe that certain situations were mishandled. Although unrelated to her ability to provide care, she continually checked her hair and make up in the exam room mirror during my appointments (this was just weird and has nothing to do with her as a doctor, I guess). It all just added up to me having the impression that my appointments were about her, what she wanted at that moment (because it might be different at the next appointment) and had very little to do with my preferences. She's also very into defensive, high intervention pregnancy management. Every appointment I had another lab test or sonogram that I ""needed"" to do...and this was a healthy, uncomplicated pregnancy.
I came to believe I wouldn't be able to trust her during the delivery of my baby. I switched providers in the middle of my pregnancy and was very happy with a different doctor who had a more open communication style. Dr. Bobo has good reviews elsewhere so clearly some people respond well to her, but her style really did not work for me."

She is nice, but very medical, very knowledgeable and by the book. I am concerned with high risk pregnancy, so I try to tolerate all of these. Her nurse does not return calls within 24 hours or longer, if you have any concerns that did not count towards emergency, it won't be answered promptly. Lab results never returned to me, unless I called several times and requested to be sent."

He is a wonderful doctor, extremely knowledgeable. I wish he wouldn't of taken his practice to Houston. I'm done with children for now, but if I ever decide to have anymore, the drive to Houston will be a long one... lol.

(Actually I was referred by a relative.) I had been searching for an excellent doctor as part of our pregnancy planning. He treated me for fibroids and cyst removal surgery. He and his staff (especially Estella) went above and beyond to make me comfortable as I was very anxious and stressed about my condition. He treated me with professionalism, patience, and genuine care from my initial consultation, office visits, the surgery itself, to my post and pre op treatment. I plan to have a baby in the near future, and I look forward to his guidance during that time as well. :-) Just an outstanding doctor!"

He is such a calm and nice man. Was referred to him by another woman I met after not liking my first OBGYN. I also appreciated that he runs on time, there is nothing worse than sitting in an office for an hour. He also has everything you could need in his office, so I didn't have to get blood taken or do the gestational diabetes somewhere else. We recently moved out of the area and I am so sad that he isn't my doctor anymore to deliver our second! Highly recommended!"

I have endometriosis which can be tricky to treat - he was very patient, knowlegeable and caring. He is very compassionate. His staff nurses, particularly Nancy, are very caring and helpful. When my insurance company was determined not to pay for necessary medical treatment, Nancy went above and beyond the call of duty to convince them to pay."

Interpersonal degenerate would be complementing his personality. After examining a health issue, the doctor had the audacity to firmly suggest my partner was cheating on me, because he suspected an STD -- turns out neither were the case. I'm glad I will never deal with this individual again. As a hard truth suggestion for the doctor, he should find a new line of work. "

I have honestly never been to a doctor that acted like he could care less about what was coming out of my mouth like this one did. Did no further testing and sent me away empty handed and with no questions answered. Such a waste of my time and money.

He had a lot of helpful advice on problems I had not related to his field. He even recommended some other doctors to see. His nurses are always available on the phone to answer any questions I have about my prescriptions. He prescribes generic brands when possible to help his patients save money. I haven't had any problems with the medications he's prescribed.

She doesn't seem to be very knowledgeable of health effects of different birth control options. The nursing staff and reception are very good. They make up for her lack of human nature and service."

I don't not recommend seeing this woman. She makes you feel uncomfortable in all situations, and makes you feel dumb for asking questions. Her bedside manor is horrible and doesn't comfort you in serious situations. She prescribed me with two different treatment creams for HPV and neither of them work. I am in a tremendous amount of pain and she is no help what so ever. If I could sue this woman I would in a heartbeat. "

However she charged us 415/visit(our portion of insurance)and split them between the first few visits so we were vested with her and could not afford to go elsewhere. I guess that is how she traps the patients into staying. My refrigerator has a better personality than her. She has ZERO emotion, she doesn't remember her patients or acknowledge your love ones in the room. She doesn't explain anything and doesn't tell you anything unless you ask first. The front desk staff is horrible, and calls are never returned in a timely fashion if at all. I really dont see how she has any patients at all, i wish i would have read reviews on her earlier because this seems to be the general consensus. Either way i will do what i can to get the word out, and will never recommend her. We are not going back for our future children for sure."

I felt my exam with her was rushed and she didn't feel the need to get to know me or my medical history. She's not personable and did not make me feel like a welcomed new patient. Her nurse was the same way. Needless to say, I will be looking for a new doctor."

Her staff were helpful and I enjoyed having the same doctor every visit and almost always the same nurse. I did not like having to go to a seperate location for lab work though, and them trying to bill me when I had paid at the dr.s office. Due to the size of my last baby I was encouraged to have a induction a week before the due date which is something I regret, pitocin was a mistake and almost caused me to have a c-section. The anthesiologist botched the epidural and had to re-do it 3 times....but luckily I had an awesome nurse. Finally I was able to convince Dr. Barcio to let me sit up and push ""my way"" and with the help of a mirror I was able to concentrate to deliver my son since I could not feel how much I was pushing. She was attentive after he was born and I had a good follow up. I would recommend her."

We are leaving her and going elsewhere. I thought I just didn't know how things were in this world, being a guy but I had hoped that a doctor would realize that first time parents would need questions asked for them. I don't know what questions to ask. On her defense, she did ask us if we had questions, but when we mentioned a desire to have a drug free birth, her answer was basically that we could have that as long as it progressed in the manner she chose. That's where we called it quits."

Her nurse didn't communicate my blood results to me, until I called her office, even when my blood results showed serious problem that required immediate attention. Her office staff were very prompt at creating a installment pay plan for me, for a sum of money for which I will not be getting service for 3 months from the time I start of my payment. Anyway I declined the pay plan as the sum was not big enough and also I was not sure if I will be continuing to see Dr. Barcio after such terrible service."

I had two 8cm fibroids that were causing painful days for me, she did an ultrasound found out the issue, I believe the next week I was getting them removed. The procedure went well, she came to the hospital and checked on me. Three years ago I gave birth to my son, it was expected to be a difficult pregnancy but Dr. Levin was on top of everything. I love her attitude and personality, she makes me feel welcome like part of the family not just a patient. She is a great doctor with a good taste of style. "

She is so personable and I feel like she treats me like family when I am there. I have referred all of my friends to her, and they love her too. She delivered my little sister 16 years ago, and she always makes a point to ask me about my sister and our family (my mom still goes to Dr Levin also). I recently got engaged and when I told her at my latest appointment she gave me a huge hug and was very interested in all of the plans.

Levin but was referred to her by coworkers when I became pregnant with my first child. When I called to make an appt I was told dr. Levin would only accept me as a patient if I would have a csection.

They are very helpful and remember me by name each time I come in. Of course punctuality will probably never be perfect with any doctor. She is responsible for the well being of patients and I'm glad she takes the talk to talk and listen to me and my concerns. She has been incredibly helpful. I have had 1 pregnancy/miscarriage before when I was seeing a different provider and had no idea what to expect.

She is very knowledgeable and willing to help in ANY way she can. She even gives me free birth control when they have it in the office which saves me 120 dollars! The staff has even went as far as to schedule my yearly at a time I was available and turn it in to the insurance when it came that time so I didn't get charged extra for having the procedure early!

When I called them to make an appointment, they told me they accepted Medicaid. I waited three weeks for my appointment, and when I got there, I gave the receptionist all of my information and Medicaid number. She told everything was ok. I waited for thirty minutes and when they called me to see Dr. Cohan, she did not even got up of her chair, talked to me in a very rude tone, and then told me she was not accepting Medicaid. When I asked her why wasn't I told before, she told ""I just quit accepting it and I cannot do anything for you"". They just made me waste my time. Worse experience ever."

While I will say that he is quiet and very to the point, I thought he was excellent. Obviously very knowledgeable and he explained everything about my baby as he was doing the ultrasound. He showed me where my baby's Bowles could be seen outside of his abdomen in the ultrasound and explained everything that that entailed while making direct contact with me. I feel very comfortable knowing that he will be delivering me and he and his team will be performing surgery on my baby as soon as he is born. "

Had to wait more than 1 hour to see him and he finished the scan within 10 minutes and told us he can not see clearly since the baby position is not ideal. He never told us the results for each scan.

He was very professional, attentive and took time to explain everything he was doing and to answer our questions. He even spent some time to show us our baby too.
Reception ladies were not polite, enormous amount of double paperwork. Average waiting time (about 30 min).
Nurses are good and professional. Overall positive experience. Would recommend Dr. Reiter to a friend."

My regular OBGYN referred me to him after I had an ultrasound that showed some concerns. Ultimately, he diagnosed my baby and explained in detail my diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment options. He did not rush me during this time even thought it was 530 PM on a Friday afternoon. He also showed great concern for me and my husband. I would give his office room for improvment since they did not manage the schedule very well (causing me to have a 2 hour wait time past my original appt). Overall, if you are looking for a doctor who you can place trust and confidence in, Dr. Reiter is it!"

Yes, you may wait a long time and yes, he may not give you the warm fuzzy feeling, BUT he is the best at what he does. He performed CVS with me on my pregnancy and was my doctor all the way through. He also recently performed a D&C on me. I don't necessarily want someone who is going to make me feel good, rather, I want someone who is an expert in their field and with whom I can always feel comfortable knowing that I am under the best care. With Dr. Reiter, you are getting the best care in terms of his specialty."

The nurse never answers or returns phone calls, and the doctor is not on top of what is going on. I had a complicated pregnancy, went to the the ER at the Methodist Hospital and nobody bothered reading the ultrasound reports which explained the complication (two nurses in the ER or Dr. Held) Nurse calls back with test results, but can't explain what they mean if you have questions. When I asked about bloodwork needed in the beginning due to medical conditions I have, it was apparently up to me to decide if I wanted them done, or the answer from the nurse was that she did not know what was needed. When I called to say that I had lost the baby nobody bothered calling me back except for nausea medication which is no longer needed. "

I have call waiting on my home phone as well as my cell phone. The nurse took a month to return my calls. Very unprofessional yet stated on my chart and phone conversation that she had returned my calls. I think this woman is overworked. I take my health seriously! By the way she said I had a problem with my cervix and needed to go in for a biopsy. It's been 1 1/2 years since I had my uterus and cervix removed. The Dr. recommends a biopsy as well!

I recieved a very rude phone call from the medical biller in her office who has no customer service skills, and she informed me that all of my appointments will be cancelled unless I have 2500 cash to give the doctor for the labor and deliver... and she added JUST IN CASE I TRY TO STIFF THE DOCTOR BILL!. She also informed me that 2500 is the price of a c-section which I do not want but I have to pay just in case, I told her about the insurance and she said it wasnt her problem, If I want to see the doctor I have to have corrected insurance. My baby is due in March, but they want their money RIGHT NOW..She barely spends time and is too busy comparing her own pregnancies to mine, She is incompentant I would see somebody else."

At this point, while doing the ultrasound, she basically blurted out that she didn't see a heartbeat. Stunned, we looked at her and said what does this mean? Very emotionless and without hesitation, Haque blurted it's probably a blighted-ovum and that it happens all the time. Because of the lack of bed side manner, and without any emotion or understanding of our situation, we were incensed. Because we expressed our displeasure with Haque's demeanor, she ""discharged"" my spouse from her care. This happened in excess of 10 years ago and it's something we never forgot. We now understand that these things do happen quite a bit, but how this was told to us and how she acted as if it was no big deal, especially for first time parents, no one should have to go through something like this.

I have had a pleasant experience with Dr. Haque and her staff. I would recommend her to anyone for their pregnancy. I'm considered high risk and I feel like Dr. Haque took all the necessary precautions. I had to be induced with my first two. The inductions went extremely smooth. I felt comfortable at all times. I will also be induced with my third base off my history and current medical conditions. I've seen other reviews stating the doctor forced induction however I never felt forced. It is for my safety and the baby.

It was the worst experience. During delivery, she was barely around even though my son's heart rate kept dropping. Then when it was time to push and I was fully dilated, the nurses just apologized and said they didn't know where she was and made me lay on my side and wait. They called and called but couldn't get in touch with her. Turns out she was in an emergency surgery....For 3 Hours before she got back to my room. The anesthesiologist was offering to deliver the baby. She also has zero bedside manner...After delivery she told me about my hemorrhoids/prescribed medication in front of my family and extended family. Didn't even give them time to leave the room. I would not recommend her to anyone and honestly I question her ability as a doctor."

Everything was going well till I got close to delivery, first baby and a very healthy pregnancy but she still pressured me every week after I hit 38 weeks to have an induction. I'm a nurse and I knew that there was no medical necessity for an induction. It made the end of my pregnancy very stressful. She wanted me to induce 3 weeks before I finally gave in, I induced at 41 weeks. I won't be seeing her for my future pregnancies "

I had to have a laparotomy to remove 5 fibroids; two cantaloupe size (12 cm) and three baseball size (10 cm). Dr Haque recommend an epidural which I am soooo grateful I took her advise. I had no pain after surgery! I had to have a 5 inch vertical incision starting below the navel. I was under general anesthesia and surgery lasted about 1 1/2 hours. The pathology report showed my uterus weighing 7.5 lbs!!! Dr. Haque was very knowledgeable on what options I had. Very caring and had awesome bedside manners!!! I lost 12lbs after surgery and no longer looked 6 months pregnant. The change was noticeable after 2 1/2 weeks. I wore the belly wrap day and night for my entire recovery period for 6 weeks."

She spends less than 5 minutes in the room and looks at you like an idiot. She's very emotionless and is just doing a job. I don't think it's a good idea for first time moms to go to her, although when you have done experience having more kids, you won't feel too offended. Know your questions when you go in, and talk to her. Call her out on the spot if necessary, but don't let her walk out on you when you're not done with the appt. "

I was bleeding for 2 months after my d & c, should have switched Doctor immediately when I felt some thing was wrong with the care.

The ladies at the front desk always think I should pay more than my co-pay or argue with me that my insurance company doesn't cover certain things. I am forced to overpay and then after they file with insurance I'm due a refund but never get it back. Their billing department is horrible. The wait time is at least 10 min and then they say they're putting you on hold but hang up on you. I actually had to contact the state medical board to get my money back ($177). This doctor has been fined by the tx medical board and has pending lawsuits against him. This is an office I won't ever go back to.

People should just give him all of the information, and let him do his job. His staff is beyond kind. Trudy is a gem. There were some comments here that mention that a few people felt they were passed to others for care. If he is delegating, he only delegates to people he trusts, and those people KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING. His team is amazing, and his brain is like a machine filled with knowledge and a lifetime of experience. He donates his time and his skills to helping those in need when he is away from his practice. For me personally, he communicates at the level at which I need him to... doesn't dumb things down, but explains what and why he is doing what he is doing, and he is not condescending at all. He is thorough. Let me repeat that... THOROUGH... thus, the wait sometimes... He is a true gentleman... kind and caring with a very soft and sweet demeanor. He understands faith and is a true blessing."

After an hour wait I could no longer wait and decided to leave, I told the nurse that I couldn't wait ny longer and she called the dr. And he without apologizing asked me what the problem was I told him that we had an appointment about fertility options, he couldn't recall what he had said and began to ask me personal questions in the hallway where everyone could hear.

Dr. Holt was called in to verify and discuss with me what all needed to be done (very informative and sympathetic). I just had my surgery 2 weeks ago and WOW am I doing great now.

Nobody told me the side effects(stops your period, menopause, hot flashes, depression,lack of sleep,etc). I went a second time but they had forgot that I was suppose to have a second shot and the nurse told me she did not even know I had had the first shot. (They never check my chart). I barely see him ever only his nurse assistants who keep contradicting each other. Had a FSH so see my prolactin but they never told me it had to be on the 2nd or 3rd day of my period and it came back with a 10 which means I can't have babies anymore. Went to a fertility dr and he said the test had to be done on the specific days and the test came back with a normal 6. Now I have had no period for 4 months, they gave me medication to bring it back.Just a few drops came. I have called again. They never call back.Holt said to get off my bipolar meds.

If there is a wait time, oh well, he is so worth it. Trudy has been with him the entire time that I have been going to see him. That says something about Dr. Holt as an employer.

Her answer to my question was ""Yes, that, change in exercise, and dietary habits"". She also pitched me birth control which she also noted as part of a consult. I didn't want it, but she gave me a trial pack anyway cause it was ""free"". Go somewhere else, there are plenty of other GYNO's in that building and the neighboring building.

At every visit I felt rushed and I felt like she was sick of me and my questions. In addition vaginal delivery was out of the question. She only wanted to do c section. And I was not high risk.
She is a crook, criminal and I hope karma catches up to her.
Also her office bathroom has roaches. "

After moving here from out of state I needed to find an OB/GYN in my area. She is young, up to date with a wealth of medical information and very easy to talk to. She is so sweet and is a great doctor. She really cares about her patients. I highly recommend her if you are looking for an OB/GYN. She's amazing. I always had problems with cramping or bleeding after pap's in the past and I was expecting the same when I came here but it was quick, painless and best of all no bleeding afterwards."

I was lucky enough to pick the BEST gynecologist in Houston (or anywhere else for that matter) 12 years ago. Dr. Leibman delivered my three beautiful children - spending the night at the hospital for one, coming back for the other and rushing there just in time for the 4th. In each case he could have had someone cover for him. He didn't. He also walked me through the most difficult loss I have ever faced when I lost our 3rd baby. He is calm, compassionate, dedicated & cares more than any doctor I have ever had. I feel blessed to be his patient. He loves his family, his work and his patients, and it shows. Deana, his longtime nurse, is awesome. When you walk into his office, it is a relaxed and unhurried atmosphere. He left a large group to build this small practice, seemingly for just the purpose of making his it a better place for his patients. He succeeded. I recommend him to everyone I know.

He listens to my concerns and is understanding and compassionate. He is also extremely experienced and professional. He is honest and doesn't beat around the bush. He is a straight shooter. I highly recommend this practice and Dr. Cook. Amazing doctor and for anyone who is hesitate to use a male doctor I would highly recommend him!
If you are short on time, don't use the med
Center office! I have used other doctors with offices at the med center and I believe you should deliver at a med center hospital but I recommend booking your appointments at a satellite office. All med center doctors' office are extremely busy (especially since they may be at the hospital during your appt. which is out of their control) and parking is expensive.
USE THEIR SATELLITE OFFICE!
They have a satellite office so you don't have to fight the med center traffic but also have all the benefits of a doctor who practices in the Houston Med Center. Great doctor and amazing practice group."

When I tried to ask her questions about my preganancy and conerns she told me to purchase the book ""What to Expect"" because that had all the answers. I found her to be abrupt, short, and rude. I was so traumatized by my experience with her that my husband had to force me to find a new dr for my second pregnancy as I never wanted to step foot in an ob/gyns office again.

You need to ask questions to get something out of her and she hardly spends few minutes, not worth waiting 50 mins.

I could not have asked for a better doctor then her.

During my time there I had pellets come out on 2 occasions never happened before moving to there office. On October 10th 2018 went in for my regular 5 Month repel-let, left the office was in my Vehicle for 2 hrs driving and when I got home and out of my truck, there was blood everywhere, I had been losing blood since I left the office. My wife tried to stop the bleeding she couldn't, it was gushing out, went to neighborhood Emergency Clinic, Doctor had to put 4 staples in me and told my wife and I we would of never stopped the bleeding, because the Dr. had hit a artery.
I went to see Dr. Imtiaz to discuss what happened, to see if I had lost any pellets and for her to pay for my Doctor bill, she said it wasn't her responsibility. Couldn't believe it, but I didn't argue just got up and left. Now I see why here reviews are so bad!"

Speaking for myself, this is how I felt last year and a few years before as I battled and struggled with early menopause at age 35. I also had a Thyroidectomy at age 21 when I suffered from Hashimotos. After seeing numerous Doctors, Gynecologists, Fertility Doctors and Endocrinologists trying medication after medication to get some sort of relief, I thought there was nothing or no one that could help me feel like a woman should feel. I learned about North Cypress Women's Center last year and made an appointment to see Dr. Imtiaz. This sweet, caring, genius of a Woman & Doctor experienced the worst of me and my hormonal outrages. I mean, let's do the math...I'm sure she sees MANY Women like me and I cannot imagine how tough it is to see hormonal Women every day of her career. After starting my treatment with Dr. Imtiaz, I am on my 2nd round of Hormone Replacement Therapy and taking all of the Supplements that she recommends for me, I must say that I have felt the best that I have ever felt in my life! I feel like a Woman should feel!! Dr. Imtiaz and her staff always told me, ""You have to give this time! It is not going to come over night."" Which they are correct...you must have some patience when it comes to this ""natural miracle"", as I call it, to get your levels on track. My Hormones are now right on track, I feel fabulous and she will be there for me to stay on track feeling my best!
I look forward to my visits with Dr. Imtiaz and her wonderful staff! They have helped me tremendously and I cannot thank you enough!!

I went in for preventative care annual checkup and Dr. Imtiaz ran multiple test and called for an ultrasound. I had no idea it was going to be listed as general illness! Now I am left with $400+ in useless tests and I was always completely healthy, the worst thing about this is when I called to ask why, the ""nurse"", would not let me talk to Dr. Imtiaz.

Told by Dr. Imtiaz that is an organism that you can get off a countertop, I needed to clean my house. I self referred to an Infectious Disease Dr., Grp B Beta Strep is common flora from vagina and my infection was related to my hysterectomy. I was given the improper dose of antibotics, the surgical wound opened in two different areas requiring twice daily packing for 4 weeks, the scarring in these two areas is unsightly and Dr.Imtiaz is failing to report this as a post-op infection. She has poor surgical skills, is not honest with her patients, when questionrf is kurt and defensive. I would not recommend her as a Physician or Surgeon.

She seemed very knowledgable about childbirth, an delivered my middle child. She made sure I had several ultrasounds, and even scheduled one toward the end of my pregnancy - - to make sure my daughter wasn not too large for me to deliver naturally. However, I did have a lot of problems with her staff. They didn't seem to be up front about how much I would have to pay for my pregnancy. The nurses also seemed to be rude toward me, leaving the examination door open, and also telling me to take all of my clothes off for an appointment that did not require a pap smear or breast exam. I moved on to another doctor, because I couldn't see her for an appointment. They wanted to schedule me with a nurse practitioner on hand."

They do not tell you about their billing policies until you are in the middle of your pregnancy. They want to charge you in advance for delivery and they make you sign an agreement that you are responsible for any amount not covered by insurance. Since they tell you about it after 3 visits it you are stuck with them and end up paying a lot more. Also, the billing is way too much. The insurance declined most of their claims. Their policy states that they want you to pay 4600 dollars in advance. And as I mentioned they will take out any money not covered by insurance from this amount. That is wrong because there is an agreement between doctors and insrance companies that the services will be provided at rates determined by both parties. However, Dr Imtiaz office is violating this rule by charging the patients the amount not covered by insurance. The doctor is not bad. She is actually nice unlike most comments."

When they ask I always explain that my doctor was so overwhelmed with patients at memorial Hermann that she wrongly assumed I was a woman who kist couldn't dilate properly and left me in labor with strengthening contractions for 9 hours while my sons face banged against the closed muscle wall. Simply checking or attempting to adjust his position could have saved my son from a lifetime of suffering with a visible scar on his face.

My second visit a week later (for blood work) I again endured the office staff cleaning around me. I was there for about two hours and found out that the dr typically would not be there until lunch time (making my wait time to be 3 1/2 hours or more!) They said this is his USUAL schedule. So my question is, why make apts when he's not even expected to be there? I had to pick up my children 45 minutes away but they wanted me to COME BACK.

Its unbelievable that a possible well educated doctor is being represented by very unprofessional staff. Oh well on to another doctor I guess"

I wasnt informed that they only do the minimum ultrasounds because of the insurance, they just assumed everybody is cheap instead of giving the patient the option of a better care on the pregnancy (i would have gladly pay out of pocket more ultrasounds.). When we received the autopsy and placenta analysis. his diagnosis was ""these things happen, but you can get pregnant again with no problem"". he doesnt have the care for giving answers to the parents that just lost a baby. or the medical curiosity of what was behind the case. to prevent the same to happen again. since then , I changed doctor, and I;ve been refered to a reumatologist, infectologist and genetist who all of them have been really looked into everything that was involved with my baby."

We went into labor naturally and checked into the hospital at around midnight on Sunday. Our first visit with him was at his office in the Medical Center around mid April. He along with his office and staff were always promt, courteous, knowledgealbe and helpful. Dr. Zepeda was a tremendous resource to us in the office and since we were having our first this was very comforting. In addition to being great in the office, he was GREAT during the delivery! From his calm and friendly bedside manner to his expert handling of the delivery! He delivered our 8lb,10oz baby vaginally with no complications. He exceeded our expectations in every way! It was truly amazing and special. Dr. Zepeda was wonderful and we will definitely continue to use him as our family grows!"

My only complaints are inadequate pain control post-operatively (backup medication was not ordered as promised; don't know whose mistake?) and the pictures of my surgery can't be found -- I really wanted to see them. But Dr. Zepeda has been very kind to me and has drawn pictures and brought out plastic uterus/fibroid models to show me how things looked. He told me he had a difficult time getting the laparoscopic instruments in place in my body because of my obesity, and I am so grateful to him for not just giving up and doing an open incision. I am recovering nicely."

He was very rude and unprofessional and would make very hurtful comments, telling me how fat I was and to cut down on the French fries and to exercise. I was 18 at the time, I did not eat fast food and worked out everyday. When the day of my delivery came. I was was told by his nurse he was out eating and was also going to get a hair cut, I was already in labor and he was still nowhere to be found.

Dr. Schreiber's exams are all inclusive to include not only your gynecological care but considers the care being received by my PPO MD. Dr.Schreiber performed 2 surgeries (a tubal ligation at age 40 and a full hysterectomy at age 45)without issue. Over the past 10 years my weight had become an issue for both Dr. Schreiber and my MD. Dr.Schreiber has helped me over the years to address this concern, as well. Dr. Schreiber is a very matter-of-fact doctor and because of that will tell you exactly what will correct the medical problem. Over the past few months, I've lost 30 lbs - since that time my knees have stopped aching, my energy has improved, and my bursitis is improving.

She is kind and feels like she holds your hand throughout your pregnancy. This is my second baby so not that I necessarily needed hand-holding, but it is still very comforting and I look forward to each visit with her. Her staff could definitely use improvement and if you are looking to get in and out quickly - this is not the office for you. Wait times can be a bit long but I feel she is worth the wait. Also, my experience is that you tend to wait a while for high demand docs (my doctor for my first pregnancy was the same)."

She is wonderful, kind and thoughtful, and no question is dumb. She is very personable and assured me that my post-partum blues were completely normal. She was always encouraging throughout my pregnancy and even during my postpartum visit. Great doctor. My only complaints are the wait times--always had to wait at least an hour to see her; staff isn't exactly friendly, including the nurses; always had issues with billing--was due a refund as well but wouldn't have known unless I had called the billing department myself. I know some of these issues are beyond her control but it does dampen the experience. However, I will continue to see her--great doctor!"

She is a great person and Dr. but her staff is TERRIBLE. I have tried getting a hold of the office manager for THREE DAYS now. No call back or anything. Very unprofessional for a office manager. I am suppose to be getting a hefty refund and haven't received it yet and that is what I'm trying to get in touch with the office manager about. I found out that I had a refund because I called in (just had a baby a few months ago) because I've been receiving bills from everywhere and wanted to make sure that I didn't have an outstanding balance with Dr. Boon. Ashley (billing department) said you are paid in full except you have a credit. By how horrible the staff is, I probably would have NEVER got a phone call stating that I was receiving a refund! I can't even get a phone call back from the MANAGER! Unfortunately, this has costed Dr. Boon 1 patient. I do not plan to go back after my next visit (birth control that I already made the appt for)."

I had to schedule 2 different appointments because I sat in the exam room for an hour without seeing anyone. I finally had to leave to go to work. I emailed Dr. Boon about my experience. She apologized and got me in a few weeks later. I spoke with her about her practices to see if she would be a good fit. We did not speak long. I did walk away thinking she was very kind. However, I received her bill 2 months later and was shocked that she charged my insurance $150. I called to contest the charge, and I spoke with her billing department. In this conversation, I was told that her practice ""was not running a meet and greet."" I am perfectly content paying a nominal fee, but $150 is not nominal for a 5 minute interview. I was then put on speaker phone by the billing department without my knowledge. When I realized I was on speaker phone, I asked to be taken off. I was told no. Highly unprofessional in my opinion."

I transferred to him after severe complications came up with my twin pregnancy. He has been so amazing, he is so easy to talk to and has the best personality. He makes me feel comfortable asking tons of questions and always encourages me to call if I need anything. He is so knowledgeable, I've read articles about some of the MIRACLES he has performed saving babies' lives! He has done crazy surgeries on babies still in the womb and saved their lives.

I started going to her when I was a virgin and I was talking with her about how I had pain when my boyfriend would use a vibrator on me and she told me to just go ahead and have sex with him when I said I wasn't sure. Her unprofessional manner horrified me and I felt like she was very uncaring and didn't take me seriously as a patient and if she doesn't feel comfortable talking about sex with her patients then she shouldn't have gotten into a field dealing with the care of a reproductive organ.

I will go again because all doctors are rushed these days and can't spend really give extra time with you when they have a full waiting room.

Dr. Smith is very short and impatient when I ask questions. She does not spend any time speaking with me or offering me any other information.

Her nurses are also wonderful, and always friendly. It is the ladies at the front desk, and who answers the phones who are rude, and short with the patients.

After she left her practice to raise her family I saw many other doctors and was very unhappy with most of them and was relieved when she went back to practicing. I had to have surgery last year and I couldn't have asked for a more skilled and caring doctor. She is the best and brightest and I highly recommend her to everyone I meet!

I used to be a patient of Dr. Rizzo years ago before she left her practice to take time off to raise her family & she was wonderful. Well she is not the same doctor now. She was very cold & uncaring when I went to see her last week. She should have never started practicing again. She wanted me to reduce my estrogen, but when I asked her what I should do if my menopausal symptoms returned she just told me that it would happen & it's part of being a woman. She offered nothing to help me. Then I asked her what about my libido reducing & she told me that all women's libido sucks so we just have to deal with it. I asked her if she would be happy if her doctor gave her answers like that & then I told her that she should have never returned to her practice. I got dressed & let her know that I would not be coming back as her patient again. I was so disappointed in my visit with her & I would never refer her to anyone!"

He spends a lot of time counselling his patients on more than just the problem they come in with. He is concerned about their overall health and wellbeing. Whether or not you like what he has to say depends, I think, on how much in denial you are about your bad habits and health-threatening behaviours. He tells you the truth, and he does not sugar coat it. Many people cannot stand to hear the truth. They just want assurance and acceptance as they are. To me, that is not the function of a doctor. Yes, I have disagreed with the doctor before and told him so, but, even then, I later thought about what he'd said and found the logic in it and realized he just wanted to help me. I think he is a very caring person who also happens to be very bright and knowledgeable. I'm glad I found him."

We knew the pregnancy was abnormal and likely ectopic, which was beyond her scope of care. I was pleased they worked me in so quickly and the doc confirmed an ectopic pregnancy and laid out my options for treatment. To that point, I was very pleased with him. After receiving the treatment, he then decided this was an appropriate time to discuss my weight. While I have no problem with that, the rude, disrespectful and demeaning words and tones he used made it clear that my presence disgusted him. It was the worst I have ever been treated by a professional - on a visit to diagnose and end an abnormal pregnancy,which followed immediately upon a prior miscarriage - inappropriate. He was knowledgeable, but rude and condescending in the extreme. Add to that, his staff lost my labwork and were uncommunicative regarding my treatment status. I would avoid this doc at all costs."

I was scheduled to have my tubes tied at the hospital where he is chief of surgery, and right before I was about to be wheeled into the OR and sedated, he put a halt to it because of my age (early 20s). When they let me speak to him about this decision on the phone, he was beyond rude to me and said he wasn't sorry about it. He is a very old-school, paternalistic doctor who should have retired years ago. Visit at your own risk. "

I was scheduled the next day for the explusion. I requested an ultra sound be done before the procedure becuase I still felt very pregnate. (This ultrasound is not procedure but done at request). My baby girl was fine, health and very alive. I was let go. He never apoligized and admitted to his error. Told me this is why we have the has part of the procedure. I almost didnt do the ultra sound becuase I was second guessing myself. I really hope this never happens to someone every again. I understand mistakes happen but please be nice and appoligize and be sypathic for what that patient went thru becuase of your error. He was not."

ANY concern/pain was ""normal"". Punctuality ... is just not there; helpfulness ...poor. Don't even try to reach him by phone - he trained his stuff not to bother, I think. And by the way, the doctor who thinks he's seen it all and knows it all is a poor diagnostician. That's why we are out after 5 months of his ""care""."

I've had female problems that were rare and he's always diagnosed and cured me from them. I would HIGHLY recommend him. He is extremely knowledgeable, yet his bedside manner is laid back and I love that about him."

I've seen him for 30 years. He delivered my child and now 2 of my grandchildren. I trust him explicitly. You can't find a better doc.

Good for normal situations but not the guy you want for a high risk pregnancy. Missed funneling of cervix which required preventative circlage. Our twins would probably not have made it if we would not have switched from him to a more detailed oriented doctor."

I was having problems and he diagnosed me correctly. However, when my pap came back with cancer instead of giving me a hysterectomy as I asked [he flat out refused because I might want more babies] he performed a LEEP procedure that I felt every moment of. It was excruciating. When it came to having my son I was high risk. I would have nose bleeds from high blood pressure and I went into pre-term labor 4 times, but everything was ""fine"". I put myself on bed rest at the advice of an emergency room doctor. Every time I went into labor the ER would put me on medication to prevent me going into labor again. Each time he would take me off. After I went into preterm labor at his office I ended up having my son 2 months early by emergency c-section. But he wasn't there. He treats patients like they are faceless drones and then pats you on the knee to tell you its ok. But its not so I found another doctor and you should too."

He's a kind, attentive man with phenomenal bedside manner. I've seen his best and worst days and he's always very professional and gentle. I am not 100% confident in his knowledge of PCOS, but he will try to do everything he knows to help, whatever your challenge. He has delivered 3 of my babies via c-section and he's treating me in pg #4. In 2008, for my well-woman visit he strongly recommended having a mammogram, which I did! I'm 38 and he felt better to be safe. No problems! I am very satisfied with his surgical and diagnostic skills. I'm glad he hasn't retired yet! None of the negative ratings sound anything like Dr. John F Irwin of OGA at Texas Women's hospital. I think that may be a different doc! Try doc Irwin and you won't be disappointed. Schedule an early appointment to avoid delays. He delivers babies for a living, so the later in the day, the higher chance he is behind. I've had 16 years experience to master this!! :) Blessings! <3"

She tells you just like it is and also will take the time to sit down and answer any questions you ask. She cares about the welfare of her patients, its not just about money. I have and will continue to recommend her, she's wonderful. I hate she doesn't deliver babies anymore, it was wonderful to know the doctor that's been treating you for 9 months is also the doctor that will deliver your baby, not a doctor on call. If you are looking for a doctor that keeps it real, she's the one!"

Behavior seemed so odd and abrupt that I told a family member about this visit, only to learn she had stopped seeing the doctor years ago because of same experience. If need annual exam and quick checks will work, but if need someone to confide in, please note it will be notated for another doctor to see upon release of records. That was my experience."

GO TO THIS DOCTOR . My water had broke and he insisted that I stay in the bed for three days so that my water can recuperate. 😏 Then they kept checking on my baby which was alive at that time. Then he suggested that he should infuse my labor so I can have the baby. Then once I started to feel the urge to use the restroom the nurse suggested that I get up and use the rest room while the whole time my baby was hanging out of me then they made me get up from the toilet and lay back on the bed. He finally decided to arrive very very very late while my husband and family of course freaking totally out. So then he decided to push my baby back in manually so then I decided to black out. That's when he preceded to tell my family that he had to do surgery and I shouldn't be long. After I woke up to a scared and red face doctor the staff ran out crying. So after a day went by asking for our baby the staff told us that we didn't need to know where the baby was. After getting with a lawyer later on that day the CEO and The Bad Doctor told my husband that he cutted our head off. him and that hospital I pray that they burn in Hades. Till this day I have my baby in a urn. "

I did not see Dr. Korhonen but a Nurse Practioner. Ok so the receptionist is very rude and looks at you like your stupid and why are you bothering her. It's was a older women that called me to the back and she wasnt warm or inviting. The Nurse Practioner was nice but she didn't say very much at all, when I asked her questions she gave me short answers, it felt like I was being rushed. The phlebotomist WOW, so unconcerned I tried to make conversation with her and she brushed me off. This was a Cold Cold visit to a doctors office. A doctors visit should be welcoming, inviting and not rushed. So, a couple days later I called in for my blood results and found out I was pregnant, I knew I wouldnt be using them as my OB because of how I was treated. Unfortunately, 3weeks later I had a miscarriage, this was the only doctor I had seen since I found out because I made an appointment with another doctor and was waiting for the appt which was in a couple days. I had the miscarriage on a Sunday, I didn't go to the hospital because I thought it was best and most comfortable to stay home so that I can take showers and clean up as needed. Once a miscarriage is in progress it's no stopping it in your early weeks of pregnancy. On Monday, I called Dr. Korhonen's office to ask what should I do next and I know I was speaking to the older women that called me back when I was there, I remember her unconcerned voice. She asked me was I still bleeding? We'll duh what do you think u work in this field. I told her yes heavy and she told me to go to the hospital it's nothing they could do. I wasnt unhappy about what she said but how she said it. I asked her did I need to come in at all after I went to the hospital she said no. Well geez you don't even want to know how a patient you seen is doing....my gosh. I guess not cause she didn't even bother to ask me my name mayb to document what happened in my chart. Never will go back to this office! The get the finger the middle one! Zero stars!"

I love his assitant Maria, she is very personable and nice. I would definitely recommend him as an overall. The older receptionist in the front is very sweet and patient.

He can be hard to understand sometimes due to his accent, but if you ask him to clarify he does so it's not a big deal. The wait is sometimes long (10-20 minutes) for a scheduled appointment, but as another reviewer said, Dr. K. is taking his time with each patient, answering their questions and giving them quality care so it's not something I personally would hold against him."

He has been doing OB/GYN for a long time and thus practices good medicine rather than order a million tests to try and diagnose. He has a certified nurse midwife that I see for my WWE and she is very nice and educational. The office staff is very helpfull and accomodating.

When you ask him a question he truly takes his time to answer you the best way he knows how. He never rushes and acts like you’re the only patient he has.

When i asked Dr. Obukofe whether i could have a vbac, she asked for all my previous c-section reports. Once she read them, she immediately told me i could have a vbac if i wanted, and was a great help and encouragement all through my pregnancy. When i had gestational diabetes, she referred me to an awesome specialist. I went into labor on Easter day, and was worried that the doctor may not turn up, but she did! she came to see me straight from church,and helped me deliver a healthy baby without a c-section! She was a great source of encouragement to me, and has always been very sweet and kind. Her brusqueness may seem like she is rude, but she is a very sweet person indeed."

All she said was the Dr. is right next door for me NOT to push. But this idiot doctor never came. When she did she notice something was wrong. It took her a long time to find out the issue. The baby's umbilical cord was wrap around her neck. The baby now has severe cerebral palsy because of her!! If she had been there on time she could delivered my baby via emergency c-section.

The first thing she said to me when she walked in the room was ""you look way too old for your age"". Which really hurt my feelings because no woman wants to look ""too old for their age"". She also made rude comments about the way I was dressed and she also said I had a ""head full of hair weave""; Which I feel should not concern her at all. As far as doing her job and completing the procedure, that process went smoothly. However, on a scale from one to ten I would give her customer service a 1. I will admit she is very smart in doing the procedures and recommending medication. Unfortunately, she is very dumb when it comes to MANNERS. In my opinion she is not that good looking to make comments about anybody's looks. I do not recommend her to anyone!"

Her Physicians Assistants have twice seriously offended me...Once the lady pretty much told me I was a bad mother because I wasn't breastfeeding my child exclusively and the other pretty much gave out all my personal information in the lobby so that anyone who was listening could here my issues. I would compare this Dr.'s office to a Jiffy Lube, they try to get as many people in and out as quick as possible and if you have questions or concerns they make a follow up appointment.

The only reason I met her then was because I had asked the midwife (the person who had been checking me at every appointment in Dr. Reiss's office during my whole pregnancy) if she would be the one delivering my baby. Sadly, she told me no, only Dr. Reiss does it. I was Upset and said i didn't even know what Dr. Reiss looks like. So the next appointment Dr. Reiss sees me and starts making small talk as if she's actually met me before. She then says my baby is too big,close to 11 pounds and had to induce. Of course I listened to the dr. I went in at 5am Dr. Reiss didn't arrive till 5pm. Unbelievable. After waiting so long my ambiatic fluid was all but gone so I was forced to have a CSection. NOT what I wanted. And had I chosen another dr I believe I would have a natural birth. DO NOT go to Dr. Reiss, she only cares about the quantity of patients for money, not good service...by the way my baby weighed 8lbs 4oz."

During my pregnancy, she tried, several times, to make me opt for a C-section. I chose not to but every time I saw her she brought up the subject and tried to scare me into having one. I ended up having a normal vaginal delivery. At my delivery she sarcastically said she was glad the baby didn't end up having shoulder dystotia. But it was quite obvious she was thinking about the money she lost because I didn't get a C-section. She completely disappeared after the delivery and never came to follow up. I waited for hours to be checked out of the hospital and was told she was busy doing a surgery (probably a C- section!). In the end, the nurse on duty also got thoroughly disgusted with the doctor's callous behavior after leaving many messages anot getting back an answer and let us go if we were willing to be discharged without being seen by the doctor. It seems she is just in this profession to make money."

Her terrible attitude and overall carelessness didn't cease when it was time to deliver my daughter. I was in the hospital in labor and called Dr. Reiss, she actually cut me off and told me I was interupting her dinner! Needless to say she never came and her partner delivered my child instead (completely ignoring my birth plan btw and used every method under the sun to augment my labor).

I felt like I was in the dark, that she never talked to me about anything. Her staff never even took my blood pressure once. I left at 24 weeks pregnant and can not believe anyone would pay her because she never did anything. Very disgusted."

I had a miscarage and I found this doctor. But she was negligent and she did not intereted me.I lost my baby. She did not come to hospital for DNC . Another doctor come from her clinic.

Her nursing staff, is, at times, curt and unhelpful. When going through difficult personal experiences (namely, repeat miscarriages) I found her and the support staff to be somewhat unsympathetic and emotionally ungenerous. Wait times can also be quite lengthy. Marlene, her NP, is a bit warmer than Dr. Thompson herself, who I would say generally lacks bedside manner."

Received 1 result via web site but citric acid cycle portion of tests required explanation. Said I had to come in for office visit (I consulted this dr. while living in NM). Cannot afford another plane ticket to Houston. Should be able to get explanation for total testing which I paid for. Bladder function test--results in dr. office.

They are an OB/GYN clinic that has a ""no children in the office"" policy, which to me shows that they could care less about kids. There was a sign that stated, ""If you have the flu, don't come in here. Go to an emergency room."" What type of healthcare facility is like this? Their policies make patients feel like they are criminals trying to pilfer medical services. I cancelled my appointment before even seeing the doctor because the clinic's policies are a reflection of her and I felt literally unwelcomed . DO NOT GO TO THIS CLINIC!!!! Rude staff and unfair patient policies"

I agree with all of the above comments that mention her DRY Personality, and no sense of humor! I am the mother of 2 daughters that both were patients at her office. They both received not so good care from her and her staff. One might ask that after the first daughter why would I then bring the second daughter back to her office...well long story short, my 2nd daughter's preg. was unexpected. Having no knowledge of how far alone she was we had to get her to a doctor for medical emergency reasons. 9 months later into her preg. and we are still regreting it! She too did not see the doctor until she was almost ready to deliver. On top of that they gave her incorrect info. about dilating when it was so important to her for reassurance of when she would be ready to deliver! This Dr. and her staff should be ran out of town!Complaints should be filed with the medical board and local news to alert the public to stay away!"

The very first appointment I didn't even see Dr. Comeaux to do my ultrasound. I saw the technician. The second appointment, Dr. Comeaux was very dry and unfriendly. She cracked jokes about my child not knowing her family history later down the road because I am adopted, and I found that comment very offensive. Very unprofessional and very rude. I would never recommend Dr. Comeaux to anybody!!"

Dr. Comaeux does not care about her patients her only concern is getting her numbers up with the amount of patients and neglecting them because she has too many. The nurse practiioner is the one you see for all your doctor appointments and she compares your pregnancy to other pregnancies instead of treating you like a unique individual with different comlpications. Every time you ask her a questions she responds as if she is trying to defend her self and how dare you ask me a question. The staff is rude and could care less about you and your pregnancy. Overall the place is unprofessional, incompetent, uncaring, out for large amount of patients(money), never see the doctor, rude, and tend to mix you up with other patients. PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE YOU WILL BE GLAD YOU DID. THERE SO MANY OTHER DOCTORS OUT IN HOUSTON WHO ARE SO MUCH BETTER AND YOU SEE THEM AT EVERY APPOINTMENT UNLIKE DR COMEAUX."

She does not talk, does not spend time on your problems. On your visit, she will go through the report while walking into room; asks you do you have any questions while signing the report; opens the door without waiting for you to talk. You should start talking immediately otherwise she will leave the room! This is what happened during my three visits. Now I made a wise decision-changing my doctor. I seriously dont understand what is going on. Is she doing free service? come on, I am paying heavy bill on you but you dont have time to stop by to explain what is going on in my big belly???!!! Dont bother to ask how am I doing??!! Doesnt matter how knowledge you are but know the meaning of ""caring"" as a physician.

I've gone in to see her about 4 times to try to figure out what is wrong... she never did any test just pushed meds... CLOMID to be exact and it did not work.

Not only is her bedside manner atrocious, but she boldly disregarded my birth plan and lied to me by trying to convince me that despite all the research to the contrary, an epidural and pitocin were ""the best thing for my baby."" Every time she came into the room to check on me, it was like she sucked all the fresh air out of the room with her negative energy. Even the nurses cringed at the sight of her.

Several weeks later I had a question to ask, so I called in and left over 6 messages in a matter of 4 days and no one called back even though my messages stated that I was a pregnant patient of the doctors and needed immediate advice on a reaction i was having. I got a call on the fifth day from her assistant stating doctor was on vacation. POOR SERVICE. The doctor was ok when she did see you but i wouldn't want to trust my pregnancy with this doctor."

I went to a prenatal appointment. She did not want to answer my questions. It took me a month to get an appointment to her and then when I called a day before to confirm the receptionist told me that she won't be in and that I wasn't even in their system. I had to re-schedule and wait another 3 weeks. They did some lab results and never returnd my calls regarding what the results showed. Getting an appointment or getting someone to return a call is a nightmare!! I've been trying to solve a billing problem and no one returned my call in over 2 months!!

After having several unpleasant experiences with OB/GYNs, I'm glad that a friend recommended Dr. Karban to me. She takes time with every patient, listens and offers her knowledgeable input and recommends several treatment options. One thing I didn't like was that I had to wait for an hour prior to being seen, but when she walked in, she apologized and spent as much time as I needed. Also, the staff in her office were great and very accomodating. Highly recommend!!!"

Punctuality was never the norm for this clinic, but I feel like they broke records at my last appointment. I waited for over an hour in the waiting room until I got really tired of it and asked a nurse what was going on. I was taken back to the examination room within 10 minutes after that and as the nurse was taking my vitals, I asked her what the problem was with the delay. She said that there was no problem, that it wasn't a very busy day and that the doctor had not been called to the hospital (as that has happened before while I was there) and that she was in.
When Dr. Black came in the room, I complained to her about the wait and she said ""well, delivering babies can't wait!"" I was speechless! She was clearly lying since her staff had just said she was here and they weren't that busy that day. I then told her that I can understand that babies are more important and can't wait, but that we, patients, should be told that the doctor is running late. She then told me that I could reschedule or I could go somewhere else! I always thought she was a good doctor; I had liked her no-frills, no non-sense type of approach. But it is now clear that she obviously does not care about her patients, even after 12 years.
So, you are right, Dr. Black, I will go somewhere else."

I saw Dr. Black as a new patient in a fairly desperate need of specific treatment. To start, I waited in the exam room, naked, with nothing but a sheet, for over an hour past my scheduled appointment time – unacceptable for such a small, uncrowded, clinic (I was all by myself in the reception waiting area.). When the doctor came in, she offered no apology for being so terribly late. I was examined, tests were performed, and I was assured that the results would be back in 24 hours and that medication would be prescribed for me. I received no response from Dr. Black, or the clinic, after 4 days. I called the clinic three times, over three days, to follow up, but was only able to get through to a nurse once (after two days), who told me that the test results were back, but she couldn't share any information with me, or give me a prescription, because Dr. Black hadn't reviewed the test results yet. The nurse promised to check with the doctor and call me back. At this point, it has been 4 days, and I'm still waiting for someone to contact me. I told Dr. Black that I'm planning to go out of town for the holidays, and she said ""no problem, plenty of time."" Obviously not, I've given up on her – I'll never get my medicine in time. The only communication I've received is a billing statement for $220 – clearly, the clinic staff are certainly quite prompt about dispatching her invoices! This clinic also imposes rather steep fees for late cancellations and missed appointments (I showed up 20 minutes early). I sure wish I could impose a fee on Dr. Black for her gross inability to meet appointment times and failure to follow through with expensive medical care that was promised. I will never go back to this clinic, and strongly advise potential patients to seek treatment elsewhere.

My annual appointment came last week, i waited for hour and half for my appointment, i got up an ask a nurse because they didnt call me for the longest time, then she came back and said that the doctor was in surgery and she didnt know how long it was going to take, that was the end of my story my dr dawn black, the staff is very rude and i wasnt happy anymore.

Fast forward to the birth of my daughter....being pregnant and going into labor can be a scary and overwhelming time, I feel the abrasiveness wasn't what I needed at that time, and when you're OB is busy giving your newborn a new hairdo as she is coming out of the birth canal and making light of the situation, I don't know that I appreciated all of that at that particular time, plus my husband said she made the episiotomy much deeper than she needed to, blood went all over the nurse....needless to say, after 15 years I never went back to Dr. Black.

I wen back to her a few years ago when I was having problems during my time of the month. I was under 40 at the time. Right off the bat during the first visit she says I can have a hysterectomy. Didn't say why I was having problems just wanted to do surgery so that the problem would go away. I said I would think about it. Then when I called to ask if I could take a generic birth control, the nurse said yes and sent me a new script. I then called back and left several messages with no return call. I finally got a hold of the same nurse that prescribed me generic birth control and told her I was having a 3 week long period. She said ""That is why the doctor prescribed you name brand, you shouldn't be taking generic"" she had a very bad attitude. So due to the nurse' attitude and the fact that my 3 messages were never returned, I switched doctors"

She had been my OB/GYN since I wa a teenager. She delivered my first child in 1998 &my second in 2001. I have read the comments by her most recent patients and I am stunned at all the negative comments. That's is not the doctor tht I had or remember. She was excellent!! Either a lot has changed or people just view her VERY differently. I am in the process of having a reversal to have my third child(So long as God says the same) and was/is considering her again eventhough I live in East Texas: was such a good doctor that will make the drive. My first child was born at 27 weeks. I went in on a Friday from me calling her and simply telling her my legs were extremely swollen &with no hesitation told me to get my butt to Women's ASAP! And she was waiting on me when I got there! I was in bad shape &she jumped right on it. I got sick all of a sudden and she wasted no time. Declared me high risk for my 2nd baby & took gr8 care of me

These are not the qualities one associates with an obstetrician. She is competent, but is not objective. She will offer you skewed, unreliable data to prove points or sway your opinion on matters. She comes across as aggressive, at times. I wish I had gone elsewhere for my pregnancies, as the process might have been more enjoyable. Also, good luck having her deliver you. She will not return to the hospital on week nights or weekends. She does not even visit you after you deliver unless she performs a circumcision on your son! These are the reasons that I do not recommend her. After a twelve year relationship, we are over, and I love my new doctor!"

This woman and the baby brokers she works with had me isolated when I went into labor, convinced me I needed a C section, the horrific pediatric nurses refused to let me see my child (which I literally begged many times to do), the baby broker kept calling me telling me I needed to sign documents to relinquish rights to desperate entitled adopters who were foaming at the mouth for my child and I signed relinquishment documents still drugged from a morphine drip in my arm. Low and behold, as soon as the documents were signed days later I was kicked to the curb. One of the most horrendous experiences in my life that has scared me forever.

I told her - She better not retire yet - I still have a few more pregnancies left. I can't imagine having any other doctor. The wait time is always worthwhile! No other doctor is as dedicated to her patients as Dr. Que. She always gave me the best advice - even if I didn't really want to hear it. She was like an Aunt.

Back in 2010 I was due with my first child, and had researched natural births. I didn't know how to do any of this, and was completely unprepared. My family doctor recommended a well known OB/Gyn at Tomball Women's Center, and she handed me off to Dr. Lee.
I wasn't informed by Doctor Lee that she prefers C-Sections, and we had discussed our idea of a birth plan, no drugs, with her. But when the date got closer, she started acting as if something was wrong with my daughter. I was sent into the hospital without explanation. A nurse met me there and asked why I looked scared and upset. She told me that my stats looked great and that I was there for fetal heart monitoring for five hours. I got to the hospital scared out of my mind. The nurse assured me that everything was fine.
The doctor insisted that we schedule to be induced the next week. Five days before my due date. I gave in because I WANTED to be done with this doctor. I didn't know all of my rights as a young woman. They don't teach you this kind of stuff in school, and if your parents don't teach it, or don't know it, you don't learn it.
Needless to say, it didn't go well. The nurse that met me for my heart monitoring came in the next morning an volunteered as my nurse. We had enjoyed a nice long chat since I was one of one or two people in her wing. She was surprised that I had not been told about birth centers and that I didn't check to see if our insurance covered midwifes. I told her I didn't even know where to start when we found out originally, and I had NO guidance.
Dr. Lee would come in and seem disappointed that I was not progressing fast. First births sometimes DON'T. They can last a long, long time. I knew that from my research. She pushed me for painkillers when my contractions finally started. I refused. She repetitively tried to talk me into an epidural (with a family history of back problems, that was NOT an option). And then, when my water hadn't broken and my dilation wasn't to her liking, she tried to convince me that I needed magnesium sulfate.
My nurse had explained what it's common use was, what it is normally used for... and they didn't add up at all. Magnesium sulfate is a common drug used for treating preterm labor. It is not typically used on someone in labor that has been induced.
Anyway, I refused it because I was confident that it wasn't necessary. The nurses warned me that I was developing white coat syndrome. Dr. Lee made me feel uncomfortable. She made me feel like prey, and it was obvious that she really wanted to get me onto an operating table. Which made me even more nervous.
If it weren't for my nurse's experience at a birthing center; my own research on stretching my body, using gravity to benefit my labor, etc.; I would have wound up with a c-section that I did not want.
I will never fully understand why a doctor that is not comfortably with natural birth would willingly continue with a couple that does not want drugs or surgery. But this is your warning. According to several shocked nurses that were NOT with me during the labor and birthing, I was an amazing young woman for having a natural birth with Dr. Lee. And apparently, I wasn't just a natural, drug free birth. I was Dr. Lee's first one, or at least the first one she had at Tomball Hospital.

As some of the other women stated, she seems very insensitive to your concerns. I could never get a straight forward answer from her & I always felt rushed & like she didn't genuinely care about my concerns. There were even a couple of requests that she completely ignored.
They make you pay everything by delivery so if your on a tight budget do not go here. All of the staff, except for Sarah, are rude and could care less about helping you. The phlabodomist is HORRIBLE! She not only missed my vein she was very rude & unprofessional!!! Dr. Lee is hard to contact directly, the staff makes you speak to her nurse.

Had to undergo an immediate c section because baby's heartbeat was dropping with every mild contraction ( acc to dr lee I was not having any contraction at all till that time)
My baby was born severe meconium aspiration problem , had to be put on ventilator for 100% oxygen. His placenta had stopped working few days ago and his lungs were filled with meconium(poop). He has tubes coming out of every body part n was in ICU for several days. All the doctors n nurses in Icu told us they have never such a bad case n the baby should have been born 10-12 days ago. They kept on asking who our doctor was, weather we were going for regular checkups or not.
Dr lee next day on her rounds dint agree that this thing could have been avoided or detected. It was a shock that with such medical advancement doctor could not have done anything on time.
The doc who did the c sec told me on the operating table just after the operation tht I was lucky to get in today in hospital where dr lee had told me the same day in the morning tht I shld wait for few more days for getting induced.
My unborn baby was tortured by her n first few days of his life were ruined n painful bcz of her. Carelessness."

I was seen by her once for my second pregnancy at 5 weeks along, at 6 weeks I started bleeding, called the office and they told me to go to the er because it seemed like I was having a miscarriage, the whole time I was going through this I did not even get a phone call back from Dr. Lee. Her nurse informed me after I called 20X that they saw my levels were a little low when they saw me a week before (they never let me know this) and thought that I may miscarry. After I got out of the er I had some concerns and needed to speak to my doctor, not just a nurse, I called all day and all night begging to talk to my doctor and her staff told me they were leaving my messages as urgent and she marked them as not urgent (I think losing my baby was an urgent message!) And I never got a phone call back from her. EVER. I went to another doctor which did a d&c for me and took over my care. Come to find out the bleeding wasn't a miscarriage, it was an ectopic pregnancy, that's why my levels were low when I came in for my first visit, which she should've known that's the first sign of ectopic pregnancy! Luckily the baby didn't form enough to be able to see it on ultrasound. I would NOT reccomend Dr. Lee at all. Choose another doctor. I wish I would've known she was going to be the way she was with me."

I called the office to speak with Sarah about a Rx refill and the office staff would not transfer me to Sarah. I was told to have the pharmacy call in. After explaining that I needed to speak with Sarah about the refill, still refused to transfer me. I called back to let them know I would be seeking a new Gyn, they could absolutely care less."

But Dr. Lee, she did discover that my Ob from my 1st son had missed that I'm A- blood type. this is exteremly important, b/c when I started bleeding with my 2nd son, it was b/c I never recieved a Rhogam shot and b/c my blood type is negative, my body thought the baby was a forgien invader, my body was trying to abort the baby. I was pleased she caught this, we could've easily had a still birth or a baby with major medical problems. She was wonderful during delievery and post delievery but don't go here unless you can pay off your deductable and office visits before you have your baby. I don't agree they drug tested me, which I dont do drugs, I'm a nurse, but I had to pay the $100.00 for the test my insurance said it wasn't necessary."

My baby had the umilical cord wrapped tightly around his neck, I had to immediately stop pushing so she could cut it off..my baby was not breathing and he went straight to NICU. Dr. Lee was very professional and took prompt attention to the situation..advised to stop pushing and immediately cut the cord off.

First, this office has charged me far more than they should and refuse to give my money back (I've been trying for nearly 3 weeks now, and have called several times). Second, the office personnel, including the receptionist, the billing manager, and one of the women who answers the phone, are rude and unhelpful. Third, Dr. Lee prescribed me a Category C painkiller during my pregnancy without informing me that it could pose a potential harm to my baby. Fourth, I was once given a prescription with someone else's name on it. Fifth, on one occasion I was left in an exam room, naked from the waist down, for 40 minutes (at which point I found someone to help me and was escorted into a different room). Finally, when I was spotting during pregnancy, the on-call doctor would only tell me to call back during business hours to schedule an appointment; when I did, they wouldn't see me for 2 more days.

When rejecting her insistence that I follow her suggested treatment plan, she became someone like Nurse Rachette! I was already worried and concerned about a prolapse condition.....this overbearing, rude woman made me feel ten times worse.

She was sarcastic, rude and yelled at me! What doctor yells at a patient?? On top of it all, I have severe anxiety that I warned her about and she did not soften at all.

Like previous comments, I feel she is always in a hurry & rushing through. Often my concerns are brushed off with short answers. I am not one to complain or get anxious easily. When asking multiple questions, she seems to get irritated. My previous OB/Gyn was very warm & caring. He took the time to listen & explain to address my concerns to HELP ME understand. Would have kept same MD if my company hadn't changed insurance company. Going to look for another OB/Gyn...one that I would be comfortable talking to and shows me he/she really cares."

In 2009 I moved from Pennsylvania to Texas going into my seventh month of pregnancy with my daughter. I was 41 at the time and obese, but the pregnancy was going great. My OB in Pennsylvania was awesome. I'd already done most every test needed by that point to determine risk to me and the baby. All good. I had researched Dr. McCloskey when I had gotten pregnant in 2004. I thought she was a high risk pregnancy doctor. Anyway, she is a nice woman. Unfortunately she wasn't my doctor for long. Immediately things were rough. Even after getting all my medical files from PA, they were convinced I had diabetes, high blood pressure and more. So I was made to do a barrage of tests. All of which I passed with flying colors. And paid for out of pocket. But there was a catch. Since the baby was due after the first of the year, they required I pay $1500.00 upfront; half of my insurance deductible. I wanted to pay it, but was unable to. Moving state to state is hugely expensive. As it was we were playing catch up to the point I had to borrow money from my mom just to pay rent. But we were on a good path to make decent money in the new year. Hence the move in the first place. I told them my circumstances, and Dr. McClosky seemed grudgingly ok with it. But then, only a month after becoming her patient, and after going through a bunch of unnecessary tests, I went in for a routine appointment. When I was called back, it was not the Dr. who greeted me, but an older woman who I believe was her accountant. She immediately tore into me about how they were a for profit business and I was a lazy mooch trying to get something for nothing. I'm standing there flummoxed, with my two year old son standing with me. This woman was yelling at me. Calling me names. In front of my son. We were just inside that first door from the waiting room. Everyone could hear her. She ended her tirade with, ""Good luck finding ANY doctor to take you! Perhaps you should try a clinic for the poor!"" I thought she was going to spit at my feet at that point. Instead I was ushered brusquely out the exit. I was stunned and confused. I was into my eighth month of pregnancy and had no doctor. Terror set in right after. I started to get symptoms of postpartum depression. I dreamed of cutting my own baby out of my belly. After a month of standing in lines for 6 to 8 hours to fill out paperwork and see doctors at other places, a doctor did finally agree to see me. I told him my story and he seemed sympathetic. But then he got a letter from Dr. McClosky's office saying they had to terminate me as a patient because of my super high risk pregnancy. So he dropped me, too. But at least he referred me to someone else. That someone else being the medical teaching college next door. So my daughter was born under the not so steady hands of students. And I am eternally grateful!"

As for the insurance comments below...PEOPLE DO YOUR HOMEWORK BEFORE you go to the office.

Yes i noticed her note pad seems a little disorganized, she have asked me the same questions on the next visit when she had already written them down, that is my only complaint of her. Wait time is very long, that is because she is the only one in that practice. During examination, she can be rough, i left with a feeling of soreness that lasted thru the night. Her office is understaff, there are only two. One acting as receptionist, billing, management, and the other is a nurse.

I was having a little pain in the abdominal area, so Dr. Zanders ordered the standard tests and I had to get an abdominal and vaginal ultrasound. The tests were negative for cancer and the ultrasound didn't pick up anything. She kept insisting I had endometriosis and I should take medication to make me go into early menopause as well as having laparoscopic surgery. I was 34 years old at the time, so I was not very happy with this diagnosis. I was scared and crying in my car after the appointment. I never went back to her. Here it is 7 years later and I am fine! I assume I had a functional cyst (disappears after menstrualcycle) on one of my ovaries. Good thing I didn't go straight ahead with her suggestion. Always get a second opinion. Also, as others have stated, Dr. Zanders always seemed a little unorganized/spacey and took too long to get up-to-date with patient notes and history. I didn't get a comfortable feeling from that."

May God Bless her."

Yes, she is usually behind schedule, but I don't mind because I know that when she gets to me, she will be VERY thorough! That is what causes her to get behind schedule I think. She gives everyone the same thorough care. She has helped me with anemia and weight issues far more than my family doctor ever has. I have been a patient for more than 12 years and I would not trade her for the world."

She should not be practicing medicine and I reported her to UHC. Do NOT see this woman.

I had had my last appointment scheduled for several weeks. The morning of the appt. I called to confirm that Dr. Zanders was on schedule and was told to call back closer to my appointment time. I called back 30 minutes before my appt. and was told that she was basically on schedule. I arrived precisely on time and 1 hour later, I STILL had not seen Dr. Zanders. I then dressed and left. I wasted 2 hours out of my day on Dr. Zanders. I would not recommend her unless you have ample time to sit and wait. I do think she is a good Doctor that needs to manage time better. I will not be returning."

Upon the first visit she named our due date (Jan 2nd 2008) and was right on. She was very professional, knowledgeable & friendly. She made us feel comfortable as well as happy just to be there to see her. The delivery went off without a hitch. I only wish Dr. Zanders could have delivered our second child who was born with a Brachial Plexus injury due to an amateurish ham-fisted doctor in Hayward, Wisconsin. Dr. Zanders is the best of the best!"

By the time she does come in she spends so much time trying to decipher her notes in your medical record that you are running into your third hour of wait time. When she is with you it is clear you are her only concern; however that is what leads to much of her demise as it took her 2.5 hours just to get to you as she spent your appointment time with the last patient she had. She does not anticipate any questions you may have about your pregnancy and even though you go every month each time you feel like a brand new patient. She does seem very spacey and never seems to be organized at all. She does not seem to truly care about her patients or their time and often just seems extremely overwhelmed. I was charged for her to process FMLA paperwork and after 2 weeks I had to go in and demand the paperwork be returned to me and I still waited another 25 minutes for her signature. Her nurse is constantly apologizing for her.

Dr Zanders appeared to be ""spacy"", very unorganized and did not remember much of my patient history even though I've been her patient for a while. Lastly she still owes me money (I overpaid for a procedure) and still is not able to get this refund 5 months after the procedure. The office kept giving me the run around. I am seriously considering legal means to get my money back. Also the office never calls back about exam results, there is no care nor followup involved. Please do not go to this doctor."

Dr Nisbet: HORRIBLE.
I am 20 years old. I came for a well woman exam. What I got was a 45 minute spiel of insults about my weight.
I gain 20lbs over the course of a year due to being clinically depressed. One comment asking about my weight gain would have been expected, but this woman barraged me with it. She did her exam. She didn't ask me what my birth control methods were, she didn't explain what she was going to be testing for. She spent literally the entire time asking me why I gained weight and then mocking me for any answer I gave her. “How hard is it to eat healthy?” “It’s not, but for a while I was clinically depressed and had a hard time finding the motivation.” And she scoffed. I am a healthy young woman, I have enough pressure on myself and how my body looks. Her comments were not about my health. They were hurtful, insensitive, and completely unprofessional.
I left that doctor's office in tears.
You lost a family of patients, Dr. Nisbet."

My sister was pregnant with twins at the same time and went into early labor, losing a precious baby in the process. I was devastated at the loss of my niece and terrified it would happen to me! Not only did she take the extra time to reassure me during visits, but she took the time to make personal calls to check on me at home! I found myself slipping into depression over my niece and her continual positive attitude and compassion for my situation kept me grounded. I have never had a bad experience with her or her staff and I have been using her for over 10 years!"

Front desk staff are rude, phone staff do not deliver messages (I left one about finding a breast lump, they told me they would have the Dr call me, never happened, despite my calling again several times) I asked for my chart since I was going to another Dr, I was told I would have to pay for it, I told them I would not pay for it, I was leaving because of their totally inadequate patient care not by choice. I spoke with the office manager who asked me to meet with her and Dr Nesbit at 1.45pm Wed. The office manager who had asked me to come and talk to her and Dr Nesbit took me in her office, handed me an envelope with my chart, asked a couple of details about my experiences, said they would be looking into it, I asked if I was going to see Dr., she said she was busy with patients, what am I? I took my chart, told Kim I was shocked that Dr would not talk to me and left. A HORRIBLE experience, BAD MEDICAL CARE."

She's a decent doc, a good surgeon and both quick and gentle for an exam, but her staff is *terrible*, and GOOD LUCK getting anyone on the phone. Ever. And when you do, double-check whatever they tell you on WebMD or Planned Parenthood.com, because they have given me erroneous information. I am switching docs after growing more and more dissatisfied with the service at her clinic, which I think is beginning to resemble a baby factory. Sad, because I'm satisfied with the doctor herself."

I have continued to go to her office and have been disappointed in the PA's in her office. The one I saw did not run a pregnancy test on me and ignored my request for an ultrasound after I came in with pelvic pain. 6 days later I was in an ER and then emergency surgery for a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. I am not sure if any of the tests at Dr. Nisbets office would have caught this early however, it would have been nice to try... not going back and would advise against seeing the PA's there."

I have not had any problems with the staff. They have been nothing but friendly to me. Dr. Nisbet herself has been a little unfriendly some days but then other days she is great and very friendly. On the days she is not as friendly, I still would not describe her as rude. My mother in law and sister in law both go to her also and are the ones who recommended her to me. She delivered my nephew a year and a half ago and my sister in law had nothing bad to say about the experience."

I love her as my doctor (5yrs) - she will discuss health and treatment options openly, which I very much appreciate and prefer over sugar-coating. I feel extremely comfortable with her recommendations and advice, and my experiences with her have not disappointed me."

Dr Bruce was very patient with me while I had lots of concerns and questions. During our delivery we and a massive emergency when my child was stuck, dr Bruce was amazing and saved both of our lives. Unless Dr Bruce stops practicing I will continue to use her and only her as my OBGYN. I highly recommend her and believe she is very knowledgeable and has good bedside manners. I believe we have to remember we are not her only patient and I was extremely pleased when she stayed at the hospital until the middle of the night to deliever my son and not pass me off on the doctor on call. I also experienced a baby that did develope a heart beat and dr Bruce was very open with me about my options informing me there were prescriptions I could take or I could schedule a DNC. I have not felt at all that she was out to make more money and has always explained all of my options. "

She is an excellent dr that has made sure all questions were answered and fears were alleviated about congenital medical condition that affects delivery. Her staff is great have been through change of back office staff but all have been very helpful. As far as punctuality there are days that appointment times are missed waiting but people fail to remember your baby doesn't come on a schedule so you can't fault her for that because you would want her at your delivery not seeing patients. Definitely recommend her to family and friends.

She seems focused on making sure she gets to maximum amount of money out of you while at the same time having no concern for your questions or emotions. Our very first visit when my wife was only a few weeks pregnant she already started bombarding us with all of these expensive add-on tests you can do for screening for birth defects etc. There is a time and a place to discuss this, and in my opinion those tests are not relevant at this point. When my wife came in for her second ultrasound to see if the baby had a heartbeat, it did not, and Dr. Bruce was very cold. She told us that we needed to do a DNC, we told her that we didn’t want to do a DNC because it’s more evasive than other options. She started berating us. I don’t think it’s a coincidence that the DNC would have made her a lot more money than writing a prescription. Needless to say we went to another doctor."

She didn't even speak to me and the first words she uttered was when I had to deliver the placenta, and she said all this wriggling of your bum and screaming is not achieving anything, so you better start pushing, I was horrified and that's when I knew I never wanted her to have anything to do with me or my future babies.

Throughout the pregnancy she'd ask if I had any problems, check the heart beat, measure my stomach & that was that. I would spend more time waiting in the room for her than she would actually spend with me. I had three ultrasounds all together. After my 5lb 6oz baby was delivered as a stillborn she told me the reason for the demise was due to the umbilical cord wrapped around his neck, his weight was perfectly normal. At my next check up she said my placenta report was normal (I had to ask her for a copy she didn't volunteer this info) & if pregnant again everything would be the exact same. After talking to another Doctor,I found out my placenta was not functioning properly & my baby was not getting enough blood & oxygen which is why he was so little & that he would have been mentally challenged if he'd lived. This could have all been determined if ultrasounds were being done & his weight was being tracked."

The nurse had to apologize for the MDs behavior. She didn't say one word to me or my husband at the delivery - not even ""it's a boy!"" as it was suppose to be this big, happy surprise. Although I got a healthy son (which we KNOW is what really counts), little thanks to her on the birth experience - she ruined it.

As for Dr. Berens--she couldn't have been more generous with her time and her information. She treated me as a knowledgeable woman with respect for my views and desires for my treatment and we came up with a mutually agreed upon plan of action.

However, her staff is not overly friendly, helpful, or professional. I tend to wait at least 30' in the waiting rm, another 30'in the exam rm, and see her for less than 20'. She is always very nice, but often seems to be in a hurry and doesn't seem to take the time to see if I have any questions or concerns. Her nurse, Debra, is very nice and helpful, however, you don't always see her & I have never gotten the name or much of anything else from the other nurse who works w/ her. Memorial Hermann, is fairly nice. However, we felt the tour was intended to prepare us so that we wouldn't complain once we were there. The nurse said the baby would be taken to the nursery after delivery for a bath, etc. & should be returned w/in 1hr. However, she warned us that it could be longer. St. Luke's, on the other hand, sends a nurse to your rm to help you with the bath so that you'll know what to do once going home."

Seems frustrated or annoyed by numerous questions. Very rushed. I presented staff with contact information for all previous doctors at first visit and 3 months later they had still not requested records or submitted anything to my insurance company. Not once did I see staff wash hands or use purell, same went for lab within building. Sign on wall said required handwashing before each patient - sink was being used to hold lab vials. At least they used gloves. Appointments always started late, and were very rushed. When called about scheduling or concerns, phone calls are not quickly returned. Overall, I did not feel bedside manner was good, or bookkeeping. I felt like I was a bother and found myself feeling in the dark about my pregnancy. I would not use again."

I went to her when I was expecting my children. The problem that I found with her office is she seems to be always running behind schedule. When you finally get into a room you have to wait some more. But over all I will go back to Dr Berens again, she is a good Dr., just needs to something about the waiting."

I feel that if you see her for a pregnancy, she'll be OK. But if it is for annual exams... she is not so into it. She will request tests that are not ordinary and without any reason/heath background... So I get the feeling that it is more to make money than any other thing. And if you have a problem, it'll be very hard for she to give you a diagnosis thus a solution. Therefore, you waste time going to see her, getting tons of tests and nothing. Finally, you doubt if you were sick to start with. Finally, her nurse (Jill) is pretty rude."

She is very down to earth. I just found out she is one of our nation's leading lactation consultants. She takes the time to listen to my concerns and provides excellent feedback. I am considered a high risk pregnancy and she is very competant and I have total trust and faith in her ability. Her nurse at teh Galleria location is complimentary in Dr. Beren's practice. Tara is knowledgeable in obstetrics nursing. I can honestly say that I will go back to Dr. Beren's if I should decide to have antoher child. I highly recommend her.

But she came on Christmas day. I have been goign to Dr. Middleton since 2009 and was ecstatic to hear that she was in Houston. She has handled all of my women issues. She is a great woman great personality and she is very knowledgeable in her field. Very helpful very understanding great energy and personality. Her staff is another question especially the people that answer the phone. They don't have accurate information, they are not friendly and they are very inconsiderate of the patient especially Brandy."

Her nurse was rude and very short on the phone.I tried to ask her what I needed to do to get the hormones and she just kept telling me there was nothing she could do. They finally called back and I missed the call,I called back, and again, they were rude again and told me regular hormones were called in for me, I told the nurse I was suppose to get bioidentical hormones and she said, well you must not have made that clear to us. Call the pharmacy."

This doctor has a very smart mouth and made inappropriate political small talk amoung his residents in training while he was conducting my exam. He's very sarcastic and a complete downer to be around. I only stayed with him through the last half of my pregnancy because he works in a team of 7 doctors (I tried to schedule my appointments with the other doctors). Luckily the day my baby was born, he wasn't on duty."

She is knowledgeable and is concerned about your overall health as well--she has referred me to a general surgeon and an endocrinologist for other health issues she has discovered through tests and exams. She is a great listener and has the best bedside manner of any doctor I have seen. I never feel rushed when I visit her. She answers all of my questions and even makes time for small talk. Her nurses are very sweet. The office staff in the main office on Fannin are not as friendly as the staff in the smaller, less hectic satellite offices, but that is to be expected. The wait time varies. Sometimes I can be seen right away and other times I may wait up to an hour. It is often difficult to schedule an appointment at a satellite office if you are not pregnant, but I prefer to be seen there if it can wait since the staff is nicer, parking is free, and the wait time is generally shorter."

I only got one ultrasound pre kid! The wait time from when I arrived till I seen the docter was about three hours! When I was pregnant with my son I gained a bit of wait towards the end and the dr blew up on me in front of my mother calling me fat and disgusting and that I was killing my baby! When I was in labor with my daughter witch was induced he wasn't Evan at the hospital my baby was crowning and there was no docter to diliver her my legs were held down for 20mins by nurses while we waited for the docter and as soon as she piped out he was out the door!! This dr is a somewhat okay dr but his people skills lack big time

He never rushes through any of the appts. and is a strong believer in natural births. He is not a pusher of C-sections unless it is needed. I had all natural deliveries. He was there for each delivery until my last and she just came to fast. He is the best delivery doctor. When I was so tired and thought I could push no more, he was so encouraging,and coached me on. He came to see me each day I was in the hospital without fail. I highly recommend this doctor. My mother now uses him as well. He is an old fashioned doctor and uses his hands for measurement instead of a tape measure. If one of your concerns is that you want a doctor that will allow your baby to decide when he are she wants to be born instead of a doctor that will schedule a c-section or an induced birth for his convenience, then Dr. Davies is for you. He allows the babies to make their own date unless a complication occurs."

Dr. Davies was just terrible not only did he only ask me two questions about how I am feeling; he also caused me a lot of pain and discomfort from the exam in which I am still feeling today. It was so bad last night that I called the 24hour helpline. I am not pleased with his lack of professionalism; obviously he believes that a person on Medicaid is not worth his special attention. After all the pain I have gone through I am still uncertain about my due date he gave me the same date I could easily get off the internet. After I told him about my irregular period and visit to a specialist about fertility. I am definitely finding another doctor. I will not subject my baby or myself to such ill treatment.
1751,Dr. Thomas L. Davies,Houston,Texas,Gynecologist (OBGYN), Male,10,3.01,2010-03-08T17:40:22Z,1.8,4,1,1,1,"THIS DOCTOR IS A JERK!! He wrote things on my record like I had ""forced"" him to do my ultrasound 2 weeks early, and that I ""insisted"" on an antibiotic which I actually found out from his staff is HARMFUL TO FETUSES. It was NOT the prescription I had asked for. This man also does not acknowledge me at ALL if there is someone else at the appointment with me, and IM THE PREGNANT WOMAN!! He had the NERVE to make me feel bad by saying ""I wouldn't have recommended them if I knew you were going to choose someone else"" when I chose to have my FAMILY adopt the baby over some family he had call me. I did NOT request that he give them my information. I HATE THIS DOCTOR. And his waiting room is cramped, and they NEVER tell you that he's on a delivery and running late until you've been waiting an hour and get up to ask!"
1752,Dr. Thomas L. Davies,Houston,Texas,Gynecologist (OBGYN), Male,10,3.01,2008-01-02T10:02:32Z,2.3,2,2,2,3,I used Dr. Davies for about 10 years for yearly exams and he was great. Then I got pregnant and all of a sudden I felt like I was more of a nuissance than a patient. Having a baby is supposed to be a positive experience. It was not...until I changed Dr's half way. The straw that broke that camel's back was when I went in for my 20 week visit and had gained too much weight according to Dr. Davies. He actually told me that to put on that much weight I must have eaten everything in sight and that I needed to show some self control!!! Another note on his staff - they are constantly talking about other patients in the earshot of the waiting room. Very unprofessional. I think that if Dr. Davies does not want to deliver babies he should practice gynecology only.
1753,Dr. Thomas L. Davies,Houston,Texas,Gynecologist (OBGYN), Male,10,3.01,2007-12-03T22:01:27Z,2.8,1,4,2,4,When I was pregnant with my first child Dr. Davies NEVER listened to the babies heartbeat. He NEVER measured my stomach. He was in the delivery room long enough to catch the baby and left and I never saw him again. His staff is horrible. Do not go there for pregnancy. He must be a birth control doctor only. I went to him for 7 years and was so disappointed in his treatment of my pregnancy.

Davies,Houston,Texas,Gynecologist (OBGYN), Male,10,3.01,2007-10-07T22:10:25Z,3,1,5,3,3,"Davies himself is very intelligent but I always get the feeling he'd rather be somewhere else and I'm wasting his time. the exams are perfunctory and I get the feeling too that he's not listening to my concerns with more than half an ear. His staff is TERRIBLE and makes comments about patients within their hearing, doesn't understand simple office procedures, etc."

After that, each time I go in I leave feeling very belittled. He is not satisfied with my weight gain during this pregnancy but it is at no fault of my own and he insists that it is. We do not seem to agree on a lot of things. He makes me feel very little when I ask questions. Another thing I do not like about this dr is he does not regularly check baby's heart beat nor does he properly measure the stomach. I kinda got stuck with thihs dr as not many drs accept medicaid in this area. I just hope that delivery goes better. I have not had a problem with staff, just the dr."

She delivered my daughter 18 years ago and did my hysterectomy 17 years ago. This is the same caring physician that noticed the amount of pain I was in while waiting in the waiting room and rushed to help me. I was there to see a different physician but she was so caring that I switched. I am so glad I did.

This time, it took 10 telephone calls to get in. Once I did get an appointment, I was late because of the Harvey flood traffic even though, I left in double the time. Tried to call the office out of respect, because I was running late. Never got thru. Once I got there, the entire time I was reduced to a fly on the wall by the staff. First telling me I was late, and now have to be fit in. The staff continues to berate me about new paperwork even though I am a current patient. After I filled out my paper work again. One of the staff yelled at me that I was not fast enough and then asked me why I was even there. ""This practice is for expecting mothers, and issues with birthing and follow-ups"" You should go to another Dr. and see your general practitioner for a well women. I am in my fifties and needed a medicine refill. ""did i not know that some of the staffers houses were under water and I have no sympathy""? ""We are behind because of all the issues"" and you were late, we will get to you when we get to you"". After my appt which was at 9:30 and was seen at 12:30, I left in tears, crying all the way to my car, feeling as if I was not worthy to make an appointment and see the doctor for my needs. I cannot come back, I cannot face being verbally and emotionally tortured by the staff.

They only see you for five minutes, make you wait over 1.5 hours after arriving at the office and they rush through the doctor patient time. Unacceptable! Staff not very professional. One example, staff was on phone talking to someone about getting something fixed at her house for 10-15 minutes while I waited in front of her on the counter. This after I waited total of 2.5 hours for my appointment. unbelievable!! many more examples of incompetency at this location but few characters left. I would suggest the retrain staff or replace. Limit number of patients if you can't see all and most importantly doctors go back to basics and spend time with patient and listen to their needs."

I have been going to her for about 13 years and I'm going to switch doctors after my next appointment. Every year I get pushed back further into the calendar year for my annual appointment. Her nurse is, well to be nice, an airhead. The other nurses seem knowledgeable and friendly. The wait time is terrible. I usually have to allot anywhere from 2-3 hours for my appointment, which I'm never called back on time, even though I arrive at least 30 minutes early. I like Dr. Thayer, but much too difficult to see her and the wait is unacceptable. Disappointed after all these years."

I had a rough delivery with my first child that led to complications for me (baby is totally healthy). She remained very calm through the whole procedure, and was genuinely concerned about my health. My second pregnancy, we found out our child would have a birth defect. The entire staff stayed late that day to make sure that my husband and I were okay. Dr Thayer even called me at home the next day to see if I had more questions. Recently, I had a procedure that requires general anesthesia for many patients, but she was confident that I was a good candidate to have the procedure done in her office. I was awake the whole time, and it went perfectly. She knows her patients well and handles each situation individually and professionally."

You have to ALWAYS leave a message and wait to be called back. Staff is not friendly. The DR. is nice when you do get to see her, but you will be lucky to have 5 minutes with her where then you'll be tossed to one of her nurses or staff. I was excited to use her because I had some word of mouth referrals to use her, but i think she is so out of the loop and out of touch with her patients. It's quite sad and I think she needs to re-evaluate how many clients she takes on versus how she treats each one. I would not recommend her."

Dr. Thayer just sees patients as that and doesn't try and get personable. A little worrisome is that she didn't know how to work an ultrasound machine. Maybe I'm just biased because I had such a great OB/GYN my first pregnancy who did everything and new how to do the little things that the nurses do. In addition, her staff and office are quite rude. I was late at most 10 minutes, but didn't see the doctor until almost an hour later. Overall, I'd rate her at a 2 out of 10."

I relocated to Houston when I was 12 wks pregnant and wasn't happy about finding a new doctor. I had a few minor concerns during the pregnancy and would describe the staff with one word: thorough. I was induced one week early and Dr. Thayer was there at every point. She saved my baby's life when he heart rate started dropping and she had me in an emergency c-section in minutes. I will never complain again when there are delays in her office for emergency c-sections! Will continue to go to her for years to come.

But after I had my second son she acted like she never cared. She couldn't give me a straight answer. She made me wait 20 minutes after I needed to push cause hse wasn't t the hospital yet. Then when I got pregnant again I decided to search for another doctor and thank god I did cause I had a very high risk pregnancy and my perinatologist was wonderful. I honestly think If I would have stayed with Dr. Brown that my youngest son would not be here today. I would never recommend her to my family and Yes her office is in a very bad part of town.

Dr. Annam does C Sections and has brain washed her patients to think a vaginal birth is dangerous, please check this doctor out, she doesn't know how to perform a vaginal birth. It is easier for her to glue the incision after a C Section instead of performing a live vaginal birth, and less pain for the patient and the black women will keep coming back and she can keep making more money. Dr. Ambani thinks black 👭 aren't intelligent enough to figure out what she and all Indian doctors are doing, Indian doctors are Arrogant, the nerve of them coming from poor countries to the US. Indian doctors you are now in the US. As Aretha Franklin says, R-E-S-P-E-C-T our Precious Black women.

Most Indian doctors I have come in contact with never wash their hands before or after seeing a patient, they go see another patient and still don't wash their hands, not before or after delivering a baby, not do they wash their hands before the eat. Disgusting, so is her office staff, if the doctor is nasty, all of them are nasty. Black women are a lot more intelligent than Dr. Ambani and her staff will ever know."

So i could not have my babys service until weeks later, no compassion from them whatsoever. When i would called i was put on hold for a long time to just be hanged up on. Called again to be transfered to voicemails. After a miscarriage at the hospital the dr just left right after and sort of explained anything until 2 days later at the hospital. Not content will not be back, after seeing other obgyns i can really see a diff on care and intention to understand the patient more. Dont waste your time."

She always patronizes me, and one time I went in for a STD test that I KNEW was going to come up positive... Instead of helping me with my issue while I was there, she tested me and told me to come back even though the issue could have easily been resolved that day. When I went back for my check up she YELLED at me for contracting one, even though it wasn't my fault- I was in a monogamous relationship an he ended up cheating on me and passing it along... She made me feel like it was my fault and made me feel horrible about myself for contracting something curable that wasn't even my fault. I will NOT be going back to her after that situation...."

The office was clean and bright but the receptionist that helped me check in was not. The reason I was meeting with the doctor was for nausea and vomiting and pain in my lower abdomen. The nurses came in to ask about why I was here. I told them, adding also that I had an IUD and was asking about ectopic pregnancy. Their response to that was, So your here to take the IUD out. Nope. Not unless I have to! And they said, Oh well then why are you here? I sat there and watched the nurse struggle to open and administer a simple pee stick test. When the nurses finally left I waited about ten minutes for Dr. Qadeer to come in. She didn't seem to understand anything I was saying to her. After she did a physical exam she told me that she didn't know what was wrong with me, to take some Tums, or ""what I do to get rid of nausea in the morning is stick my finger down my throat to make myself throw up.

This will be the hardest Post. My neice Tatyana Cashy Phillips had a tragic lost this week with her first born and asked me to share her story.
I advise you to use caution while looking at the pictures but please sympathize as this is a trying time.
Carrying a baby for nine months is not easy. It can be quite excruciating. Eighteen-year-old Tatyana Phillips moved to Houston a few months ago from Dallas while pregnant to live with her father. Prepared for her new life as a mother, she bought clothes daily as well as her family members. He was her first child and the tingling feeling and kicks jolted her mind as she thought about the first time she would hold him tight. His first bath. His first Holiday. His first birthday. All of the candid and Kodak moments held a perfect vision in her mind.
It was finally time and Phillips had dilated to 3 ½ centimeters and Dr. June Coleman pleaded with her to come into Bayshore Medical Center in Pasadena, Tx in conjunction with Houston. On October 4, 2015 at 4:00 p.m. Phillips arrived and quickly went through registration, dressed out and was given an epidural at 5cm dilation. Several RN ‘s were back and forth in her room preparing her for the birth. It was now after 8:00 p.m. and Dr. Coleman had finally made her debut. She was dressed as if she was going dancing. She was in a rush and very rude to the family of Phillips; in which she was assisted by her father, aunt and grandmother during the birth. The baby was presumed to already be nine pounds. It was now time to push and Dr. Coleman tried to make Phillips push until it became too hard for her and now she grew frustrated and called in extra help. She then told Phillips to relax and placed her hand inside of her and turned the baby around. She noticed the umbilical cord was wrapped around his neck. She was able to un-wrap it. Within each contraction, Dr. Coleman told Phillips to push. His head was now out and stuck.
Nine to ten staff members were called in by Dr. Coleman. The family quickly thought a resolution was going to perpetuate. However, as the newborns head stayed stuck in Phillips placenta; the staff members were more intrigued with gossip in the hospital and home life. They continued to converse until Phillips shouted out in pain. “I can’t breathe!” she yelled. The staff members and doctors were very unprofessional and the baby’s life was in jeopardy. His heart rate begins to fluctuate.
“The baby is too big. There needs to be an emergency c-section!” Deborah Carson yelled. She was tired of seeing her niece in pain and confusion. It had been four hours.
“Just keep pushing.” Dr. Coleman demanded
Thirty minutes later approached. Phillips lay on the hospital bed soaking in sweat. She was tired and out of energy. Dr. Coleman smiled and walked closer to her and stated, “Either we can do a vacuum suction or keep pushing.”
There was no option for an emergency C-section. Dr. Coleman didn’t even let that surpass. She begin to try and suction out the baby with no permission and as she used the suction it took chunks out of his head. His heart rate was slowly dropping. She suctioned again two more times and it now cut Phillips. He was beginning to turn purple.
“I’m going to have to break his arm.” Dr. Coleman suggested
“No!” Phillips screamed
Dr. Coleman pulled him out without any further questions and broke his clavicle. The clavicle (commonly referred to as the collarbone) is a bone found on both sides of the chest that connects the sternum or breastbone to both shoulders. A fractured clavicle is the medical term used when the collarbone is broken. His neck was also broken. She suctioned his nose as if nothing was wrong.
Phillips begin to cry as she knew her son had passed. She heard no cry and Dr. Coleman was silent. She gave her the news that he had died and tried to say insinuate he was Stillborn. It was not the case and we need your help.
The next day the hospital asked her to donate his eyes. SMH.
Justice has to be served for my niece and our family. This is disturbing to the core. Please share her story...

His office waiting room was dirty and crowded. I waited 45 minutes before the doctor would see me. Dr. Adesomo did not take a complete history. His exam style was brutish. I was in so much pain, tears came to my eyes. I felt like I had been man-handled. Additionally, when I asked him to WASH HIS HANDS before the exam, he was indignant (although he did wear gloves for the actual exam). To add insult to injury, when I went to pay my co-pay with a credit card, his office charged me an extra $15 because I did not pay with cash. In general, this was the worst gynecologist I've ever seen in terms of skill, bedside manner, office amenities, and general staff courtesy."

His lack of skill and knowledge changed my life forever and left me struggling to regain my health. I wasn't given hormones after my hysterectomy. He only told me of my situation as if on a need to know basis when I would mention some symptonm from the hysterectomy. I ended up in the hospital one year later because asit was I had next to nothing in hormones and was estrogen dominate, which created such a muscle problem, excessive bruising,swelling, weight gain, and rapid aging and I was only 50. No one seemed to know what my problem was until I demanded hormone testing in 2006, six months later. Even then they only gave a minimal amounts of horomones, leaving me suffer through. Dr. Blonder and Dr. Crowe seem to be ablsolutely clueless about hormones, adrenals, and the thyroid although they both presribed bio-identicals. The office was always packed, often with 3-4 news patients."

Dr. Blonder he did a hysterectomy in Jan, I went back after a week with pain, come to find out surgical fluid was left in me that had to be removed, when I conforted him about who should have to pay for this procedure, he acted like he did me a favor by removing the fluid. Needless to say I will never go back to him, and I would't want anyone else to go through what I went through."

While I waited, I could hear everything going on with the other patients in the exam room next door. The doctor saw a pregnant lady and an elderly lady before seeing me, and I could hear every personal detail being discussed, so right off I felt like I had no privacy.
When the doctor finally saw me, she walked in with a confusingly argumentative and angry attitude, shouting angry questions about which dates I took which medications and had which lab tests done and proclaiming that my infection was bacterial not fungal. I tried answering all of her questions, but her shouting and angry demeanor was very jarring. It seemed like a weird one-sided argument, about some point that I wasn’t even trying to argue. I finally said “What does it matter whether it’s bacterial or fungal? Whatever it is, I just want to get it treated.”
It was very confusing and demeaning because I was sitting on the table, completely naked: just covered by thin paper, being shouted at and aggressively questioned with absolutely no provocation.
Then, before even examining me, she seemed to start on some bizarre agenda to prove that my symptoms weren’t caused by an infection at all and that she probably wasn’t going to be able to help me. She started coming up with weird explanations like it being eczema caused by drinking coffee, because according to this doctor who had never even examined me I have “very sensitive skin” (I don’t have eczema or sensitive skin, at all). She also told me that I need to be regularly cleaning myself with a turkey baster, and the fact that I am not already doing so is probably what lead to the symptoms.
She asked me to describe my initial symptoms and I mentioned that it had started with urinary incontinence. In response, she literally shouted “YOU GO PEE-PEE ALL OVER YOURSELF!?”
I also mentioned that I had recently inserted a finger into my vagina, and it had come out with discolored discharge. In response, she demanded to know, in an angry and disgusted tone, why I had inserted a finger. I said that I was supposed to check my IUD placement once a month. She proceeded to absolutely berate me for sticking my own finger in my own vagina, and proclaimed that it was what had caused my symptoms. She repeatedly said that I don’t have to stick my finger in there “all the time” and “so much”, when I never said I do it more than once a month. Completely unprofessional.
When I mentioned that I wanted to get the IUD removed, because I was interested in starting a family but that I could not do so until this infection was cured, she insisted that I should go ahead and have sex with my husband despite the symptoms. I told her that sex was not bearable due to the symptoms, and she very insensitively told me that I’ll need to see an infertility specialist to have my husband’s sperm placed in me without sex then, and that she couldn’t help me.
When it came time for the exam, her nurse entered and exited the exam room several times, while I was naked, spread-eagle on the table, facing the door. The first time it happened, I frantically jumped, and tried to cover myself with the tissue paper, and the doctor yelled at me because I was “going to hurt myself” since the speculum was in me.
She referred me to an imaging center because she said she felt an abnormality in my breast, then when I was at the desk paying for my appointment, she mentioned my breast loudly, with no regards for my privacy.
She was extremely rude and unprofessional, it was surreal. "

I have been a patient of her since 2009 but after my last exam I will not be back. Several times she made me wait more than 2 hours. One time I just left without an exam since I had to go to school and I would miss my class if I keep waiting for her. I left and no one apologized for the delay.
Dr. Huyn doesn't like people asking her questions, she goes through her list and is in and out in 5-10 minutes.
She also will order extra exams with no explanation or reason. you will only hear back from the office the results. after several pelvic sonograms and mamograms, nothing wrong was ever found. I think she just wants to make extra money with those tests."

This psycho of a Dr. handled my situation in an unprofessional manner and made harsh comments to a woman that's only weeks away from deliver. There is no compassion in her heart and she is a very cruel hearted women. Her wait time is ridiculous knowing she will only visit with you for five to ten minutes. Never bother to ask questions, because she will only try to out smart you with medical terminology. Well in this world you have to have patients and respect, and if this is what you desire try a more compassion, caring, kind Dr. in another location."

I would not recommend her to anyone of my friends, family.I went to the Dr office when I was 4 months pregnant, she always in the bad mood. There is on time when she asked If my husband had any question or concern before she leave the room. My hubby expressed his worry about some of my symptom during pregnancy, and guess what, she went on and on about how stubborn and foolish that question was, and how I was wasting her time with such foolish question. she was literately yelling in very rude manner. We decided that it was the last time for her. We went to see another doctor and we happy we did. I do not know where she got her degree from, obviously she not suitable to be a doctor, very ill manner, not very educated.No wonder her office got no patient at all. Please do your self a favor and go with some other choices, you deserve better than this rude doctor."

But tells you normally it's a longer wait, not apologetic at all. The staff consists some of her family members, specifically her sister that runs the front office, she is equally rude and incompetent. The billing person is extremely rude if you call to ask a simple question. He's rude from Hello, seems like they're always in a bad mood and they just don't care how they treat you. I never go online and write reviews but this time my visit and dealings with this office angered me so much I have to warn you if you're thinking about seeing her. I hate this place and I rarely use that word because it's so harsh, but in this case it's appropriate!!"

She is sweet and caring and always takes time with me when I am in her office. She delivered my first child in 2006 and shortly thereafter, decided not to do obstetrics anymore. I cried when I got pregnant with my second child because I had to find another doctor to deliver her. I have moved out of state and come back to see Dr. Nebgen every year for my annual exam. Every doctor should be as kind and caring and have a heart like Dr. Nebgen."

I have experienced all the negative things with this practice. Dr. Nebgen is a good doctor but her staff is impossible to work with. I thought it was personal with them and me. Recently when they joined Methodist I took the opportunity to complete the survey and let the Hospital know. Hopefully this will help.

Staff was rude, unwelcoming and treated me as an inconvenience. Dr. Nebgen was in and out in 3 minutes and totally dismissed my concerns and questions. I'm sure she's competent but the vibe of the whole office and Dr. Nebgen is not what a patient wants to feel when she comes in for her annual exam. Stay away from this office. It's been 5 months since my appt. and I still get angry about the way I was treated. I'm an RN and if I treated patients this way, I'd be fired."

I've been a patient for 3 years but I'm switching doctors. Dr. Nebgen doesn't seem too bad, but she never spends more than 5 minutes with a patient and she has no idea about what's going on. Don't even try to call to ask about test results or to schedule appointments. The staff never has an answer and they promise to call you back, but never do. I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS DOCTOR to anyone."

Dr. Nebgen said it was ""rampant"" and that I should have surgery as soon as posible. Additionally, I had a small ovarian cyst and a cyst on a Barth gland. I had both of these cyst for several years and had no problems with either. However, Dr. Nebgen wanted to remove my ovary and the gland. She told me to call her nurse to schedule surgery. I called the nurse several times over a three month period to schedule surgery and she never returned my call. I finally made an appointment with Dr. Nebgen to make her aware of the problem. Her nurse still would not return my call. I went to another doctor who said that the dysplasia was not really bad and that since the cysts were not causing problems that removing them was not necessary. I had surgery for the dysplasia only in May 2008. Dr. Nebgen and her office caused me a great deal of unnecessary anxiety."

She did not listen to me the 1st time (she was in & out of exam in less than 2 minutes and obviously distracted) so I had to go back the next week. She still had no answer for my problem. I was supposed to start clomid (as was told to me by HER at BOTH appt's however when it came time to take blood on 3rd day of cycle nurse not there and I had to beg receptionist to let me come in for this. Supposed to start clomid on 5th day of cycle- nurse still not there and had no way of getting the clomid. Finally Dr. Nebgen called me from her home on 5th day after I contacted her office. She asked me questions like she had never talked to me b/f & said if she hadn't gone over the side effects with me then I should not start it this month. She also asked how long we had been trying to get pregnt. This was very strange b/c I had been in office 3x in last 3 weeks. Also been patient for 6 yrs. She had NO CLUE who I WAS

She knew I would have to have a C-section and I had a cyst on the cut line. High risk doctor also thought my son may have a loose heart valve. At the delivery she had the neonatal ICU team waiting and blood bank waiting as she wasn't sure how much blood I would loose due to the cyst. She was AWESOME!

She would always listen to any concerns or questions I had. She was so attentive and personable at every appointment. I'm really shocked by some of the comments I see. I am expecting my second child and wish she was my OB/Gyn again. I would recommend her to anyone. I was in an mild auto accident during my first pregnancy. She told me to go in to have my baby HR monitored, while there she came to check on me. The tech told me no other doctors would do that. I believe she truly cares about her patients."

At the hospital she couldn't be bothered to check my progress but determined I was not in active labor even though I was having strong and consistent contractions. Gave me 2 ambien and sent me home.

She has an attitude like I'm the doctor and you are the patient and the Dr. knows best! Scary to have a doc like this because you can be in a emergency situation and you can tell her what is actually wrong and she WILL do the opposite of what you ask or suggest. I decided to find another Gyn because if I get pregnant I don't want a doctor that will not listen to me while I'm in labor. My sure fire rating is 1 Star.

The doctor never got back to us for the results. I constantly called to ask for the results and they never had an answer. The doctor gave us an answer a week and a half later. He told us that she had a small infection, and that she needed to take some medicine. It then take us another week to actually receive the prescription from him. Because it was not at the Pharmacy. Apparently the prescription the doctor gave us was incorrect. The doctor replied with just get any medications with antibacterial purposes. This man should not be operating.

If have a private insurance please go to a better doctor. Just because they are in the medical center does not mean that they are good. I know first hand the things this doctor does. He sleeps between patients and the office covers it up. He isn't busy between patients he is SLEEPING!! He gives inaccurate diagnoses and will give you a vaginal ultrasound even when you don't need it. The office oftentimes writes these off and you wont see it on your bill. There have been several patients that have canceled their surgeries once they find out he is assisting. He is extremely old and gets upset regarding his knowledge because I'm not sure he is that knowledgeable about current regulations anymore. You have the ease of scheduling because he sees maybe 4-6 patients a day. Most Obs see at least 15 daily. Please find another Dr. with actual patient testimonies. Health grades is not accurate!!!

He was at times very impatient, but at other times more relaxed. Problem was you did not know what you would get. He is condescending, almost like he believes it's insulting for you to ask questions. Mine was not the first experience like this, as a friend left him years ago. I stayed as I had not had a bad experience, until last year. He recommended an extreme, and medically unsound procedure for blocked tubes. Based on a second and third opinion I've gotten, the procedure he recommended is not, and never really was, used because it is extreme and of limited use. One doctor told me he was not board certified, though it is listed on his letterhead. I was told the suggested treatment was ""barbaric"" and ""unheard of"" in the field of reproductive medicine. I feel lucky I got another opinion before he messed me up."

He is extremely condescending and insensitive. If this is your first pregnancy don't expect any guidance or helpful advice. This doctor will not help you in any way and gets annoyed very easily by questions. If you are wanting a healthy baby he may tell you that ""your baby will never be perfect"" like he told me. Do not be surprised if you leave feeling clueless and/or even upset or stressed. The upside to this doctor is that the staff is very nice. They will take better care of you."

Now I see, I am textbook Polycystic ovarian syndrome should have easily been diagnosed or atleast suspected by the MD after giving my symptoms, but was sent home with only my yearly exam and told I just need to lose weight. Two years later, I moved and saw another doctor. Within five minutes of talking, the doctor said ""you sound alot like PCOS. Lets get an ultrasound and bloodwork."" Sure enough, all signs pointed to the syndrome and I am being treated, I lost 20 lbs quickly and my life has dramatically changed for the better. Although she is a very nice woman, her lack of knowledge regarding a syndrome that affects approx 5-10% of the population delayed my treatment for 2 years."

She takes her patient's lifestyle into account when suggesting treatment options. I haven't had any issues with waiting long periods of time or being seen by anyone other than the dr.

The office she works in is a revolving door office, always croweded with people. You feel very insignificant, and like you're wasting her time when you talk with her--a sad case, when you're talking about something important as your gynecological health! I would never go back to her (though I, a glutton for punishment, remained her patient for several years). Patients should know all Dr. offices aren't overcroweded w/sick people, late, and full of brusque Drs."

I went to the er because i was concerned about pains i was having due to a fall. She was on her phone while asking me why i was there and said she will be back with the nurse. Mind you they asked for a urine sample that stayed on the counter the entire time. Dr schneider came back 10 min later without a nurse and said i just pulled a ligament and i didnt have a bacteria infection, which i dont know how she knew that if they mever took my urine to be tested. Overall, a horrible dr and poorly mannered. I felt like she was in a rush and was not concerned at all"

She came highly recommended and I absolutely love her. She delivered my babies effectively and I recovered quickly. Her staff, however, was rude. This was when she worked at UT Physicians. They expect you to know and not ask questions (more with the front desk than nurse staff). She came in the middle of the night with no complaints and then again early in the morning. She put my labor off 2 weeks against my babies will!! And because of that, I was able to make it to 35 weeks and deliver perfectly healthy babies. She no longer works for UT Physicians and I cannot find her anywhere! I would like to continue seeing her for my gyno needs, but they won't give any forwarding info. If anyone knows where she is working now, let me know!!!"

Furthermore, when I explained problems I was having, she told me it was normal. After having my records sent to another doctor and another exam, I learned that my problems were not at all normal and I needed a hysterectomy. A second opinion confirmed this."

Short wait times, and you don't feel rushed. He answers every question, no matter how stupid. Always available to personally return your calls, never waited longer than 24 hours for test results. He knows my history without consulting the chart and spends however much time needed to explain everything thoroughly. Scheduling next day appointments is easy. Staff is wonderful and always available."

I was able to schedule a visit for the next business day and when I arrived there was nobody waiting in the waiting room! So, for that I dismissed his inappropriate remarks to us about how mean pregnant women are and to WATCH OUT for us! Somewhat on guard I went back for the next visit, and once again Nobody in the waiting room! Still can't believe I'm so lucky. Typically doctors in that area are full of patients in the waiting room. Well, after the second visit and more inconsiderate, inappropriate remarks regarding how wimpy we are nowadays and how tough they had it 100 years ago, I began to realize why he has an empty waiting room. I dreadfully went back to him for a third and final visit, thinking maybe I was just over-reacting (being a mean pregnant woman and all lol!) I went one last time to his empty waiting room, all to hear him say woops we scheduled you for the wrong day! So, I'm one less patient in his waiting room!"

My chief compliant involves their inability to retrieve crucial, potentially life changing, lab results in a timely manner. Be it blood work, pap smear, ultrasound, HSG, etc., all of these take at least a week. Once, the nurse admitted to having forgotten about and/or lost the results. Dr. Lloyd has made comments several times about how little doctors are paid, and how they are treated like chattel. This does not serve his patients well, in fact, I found myself apologizing for how little he makes. Dr. Lloyd has two nurses: one, Rhonda, that is pretty helful. The other nurse, Alma?, I have found to be insensitive and brusk."

This doctor destroyed my daughter's records improperly and has no remorse. My wife is currently pregnant and we were requesting the delivery records from her 1st child's birth in year 2000. The state board rules clearly state that doctors must keep these records until the child turns 21yrs old. When I called Dr. Torres office, I was told by Tim in billing that the records were destroyed after 7 years and he proceeded to try and educate me on the state law. After getting lectured by Tim I called the State Board and was told that rule #165.1 clearly states that the records for minors must be kept until 21. Also, I was told that when a doctor delivers he now has 2 patients the mother and the infant. The mother's records can be destroyed in 7 years but the infant's records must be kept until 21 . I called back to try to talk to Dr. Torres himself, after several tries I was finally able to reach him. This was not a pleasant conversation, his attitude seemed to be how dare I bother him with something so trivial and how dare I question his ""authority"". The story had changed, Dr. Torres now says that my daughter's records were destroyed at 10 years because that was the law requirement. When I told him I had already talked to the state board and was told the retention requirements were 21 he became very hostile and hung up on me. When I called back, his office wouldn't take my call. It gets better, an hr latter Dr. Torres himself calls back and leaves a message on my recording (which I still have) stating that he just called the state board and talked to the director and was told that before 2012 doctors were required to keep records for minors for 10 years and after 2012 it changed to 21yrs . I found this information very suspicious so I called back the Texas State Board and explained what Dr. Torres had said. The State Board had no idea what Dr. Torres was talking about and couldn't find this ""Director"" he talked to. It was explained to me that this rule 165.1 (which requires keeping records until age 21) has been in the board rules since at least 1997. This whole situation has been very disturbing for my wife and I. In the beginning, if Dr. Torres would have just admitted he made a mistake and apologized I would have accepted it. However, his DECEPTION and lack of remorse is appalling for a so called ""respectable doctor"" Like the old saying goes, it's not the crime, but the cover up that is the problem. So let this be a warning to future mothers DON'T TRUST THIS DOCTOR TO MAINTAIN YOUR INFANT'S RECORDS. The best solution is to get a copy of the labor and delivery records right away and make a copy and keep it yourself in a safe place. I never thought I would need these records so many years later, but you never know, so it's better to be safe than sorry. "

At my last prenatal appointment (I haven't even met or seen Dr. Torres yet, only meet with an OB nurse), I was told they had no record of my previous appointment. None. They didn't have my weight, BP, temp, none of the concerns I brought up, NOTHING. This is terrifying and grounds for malpractice. What's even worse, Dr. Torres works with West Houston Hospital. After being hurt and sent to Labor & Delivery to be monitored, I was placed in a room where women were recovering from C-sections. The L & D nurses talked to these poor women like they were idiots. They were beyond rude and uncaring. Then, with my curtain drawn, I hear Dr. Torres arrive. He asks a nurse where the c-section was that he had been called to the hospital to do. The nurse informed him it had already been done. Dr. Torres laughed and said ""Well I'm still going to charge for my drive up here!"" And WALKED OUT. He didn't check on ANY of the patients (who God only knows who actually did their C-sections since he didn't). He didn't even inquire as to their well-being. He just wanted to make sure he was going to get paid. Smh. Avoid this man and his practice at all costs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

I made an appt for 9am today and showed up at 8:45. I was the first one there outside of the locked office. 2 other women came and waited as well, but once it was after 9 it was obvious something was wrong. They tried calling, but got no answer and at 9:15 I left to go home and try calling for myself. When I got through on the phone and explained what happened the employee laughed, apologized for laughing then laughed some more as she explained how they moved offices. I made a 2nd trip out to the new office and explained to the receptionist what happened and was told I would not have to wait for the other 12-15 women waiting to be seen, yet I sat there while 5 of them were called. I was livid and the receptionist wanted me to reschedule!!? No thanks! They just lost a patient to the Dr. down the hall of their new office."

Also, I always felt rushed and waited hours before seeing the nurse on duty and the office was always full. The staff is nice but you will probably almost never see Dr. Torres until you deliver. The nurse who never satisfied my questions or concerns and rushed me out of the room every time I was there, forced me to get induced which resulted in a C SECTION.

I found Dr. Shah and the only thing I regret is not finding her sooner. Dr. Shah was and is everything a pregnant woman would ask for. During my appointments she never left me in the blind and if there was anything I did not learn in my previous pregnancies she made me knowledgeable. Her communication skills are wonderful and I never felt like my appointments were being rushed. She took her time with me and answered all questions during every appointment. Dr. Shah will go above and beyond... I remember her drawing for me just so I know in detail the information she was trying to get me to understand. When I cried she told me everything would be okay and showed me with her actions. If you are in the Houston/Sugarland area Dr. Shah is a must!!

She is such a world above other doctors that I am ecstatic that I found her. She listens to me, takes me seriously, doesn't downplay what I am telling her, and doesn't make me feel stupid. When there isn't an obvious solution, she doesn't just give up, but keeps giving options instead."

SO incredibly knowledgeable, and talks to you the whole time about anything and everything. She makes me feel extremely comfortable. I had my first baby delivered with her and unfortunately had to go to someone else for my second baby....4 years later I'm back and she remembers not only me, but my life and family as if we were family ourselves.
I would go just to talk with her once a month if I could...would recommend her one million times again and again."

It is very difficult to find a GYN...they all seem to want young patients for GYN. Dr Bertles is the most caring, knowledgeable Doctor I have ever seen! She always takes time to discuss any issues and answer all questions. My visit this morning I took blood work results because my GP did not have time to discuss. Dr Bertles spent all the time it took to go over the lab results. My daughter goes to her and speaks very highly of her. I am so thankful that I have found Dr Bertles! Her staff is very supportive also!"

In fact, I use her standards to measure others in the medical profession. Without her, I wouldn't have been able to have the wonderful child I have today. She cares about her patients as individuals. I liked how the staff at Methodist Hospital Downtown came to attention when she made her rounds. Her orders were followed to a T. Also, she went out of her way to correspond with my disability insurance company in order to make sure they covered me during my extremely difficult pregnancy. I would highly recommend Dr. M.

He is by far the best doctor I have had. His bedside manner is unbelievable. I don't know if he is still practicing, but if I were still living in Houston and were pregnant he would be the only doctor that I would go to. He delivered my first child in 91 and my third in 94.

She was not present at any time during any visit to her office during my entire pregnancy. She told the nurse to have the on call deliver my baby when she was called informing her I was in labor.

She didnt greet me, just did the pap test and run out of the room. i was shocked for her lack of attention. She did ask me if i had questions or concern, like i said 3min, was how long whe was in the room with me. and also the pap kit was open the whole time i was there, it was placed on dirty graph paper that was taped to the counter top of the sink. She did put gloves on but didnt wash them, totally regret it. Please go with someone that cares for their patients and that is interested in your concerns and questions.

She acts as if her time is more valuable than yours, & made me feel like my concerns were not valid. I switched doctors at 31 wks and it was the best thing I could have done! Up until that point, every prenatal visit I had ended up being with the Nurse Practitioner, who is quite nice. The appointments that were with Dr. Padoba lasted all of two minutes...no smile, no how is everything, no how have you been feeling...just in and out...I don't even recall eye contact. Then, at 29 wks I ended up in the hospital due to some bleeding which turned out to be hemorrhoids, but after an hour of being monitored Dr. Padoba finally showed up,popped her head in and asked if I was in labor. I said no, I had some bleeding and her response was simply ""Oh, well then we are sending you home."" Didn’t check me, look at how the baby was doing, ask if I had questions or any other concerns...NADA! I was so scared when I saw the blood-and she seemed bothered!"

Alot of women were in the waiting room which is a good sign. We were scheduled to see Dr. Podoba one day and she couldn' t make it because of an emergency C-Section which was good to hear because those situations warrant immediate action. It were were in the same situation we would expect the same sense of urgency. If she is busy she has a medical assistant that help out and gives very good advice with knowledge. The ladies behind counter were very nice and made us feel very comfortable. Unfortunately we had a miscarriage and if and when God Willing we were to get pregnant again we will defintely use her services again.

My mother is her longest standing patient! When my pregnancy seemed to be a little oddIi went straight to Dr. Podoba, I was induced that night night due to severe pre eclampsia that my previous Dr did not notice, some how... Dr Podoba saved my life and made sure my son and I were completely healthy and safe the entire time! You do wait sometimes at her office BUT she is the most hands on Dr I have ever seen, she delivers her babies so yes when one of her patients is about to have their child, Dr Padoba is the one there to deliver! She postponed a surgery to deliver my son via emergency c-section and I wouldnt trade that for the world and Im more than ok waiting for her while she takes care of another patient like she did me! I live in VA but will be back in TX for every pregnancy I have! I trust Dr. Podoba with my life and my children I will have!"

She walked in and was crying. I tried to talk with her and gave her a hug. I thougt something horrible had happened. She then proceeded to tell me that I was fat, disgusting and that she could not bear to examine me. This appointment was 22 years ago, in Houston, at the Prucare clinic. I am 5'8"" and weighed 225. I left that appointment in tears with office personnel running after me. Dr. Brill never contacted me.. never sent me any kind of apology. Nothing.I had a hysterectomy six weeks later. I have never been back to a gynocologist; and, even though I know I should, I cannot bear the thought of going to another docter and subjecting them to my disgusting body.I am an adult and I know that I sound petty and bitter - but this woman was so over the top unprofessional and downright ugly and mean...

She will not give you attitude or rush through the appointment. She actually does sit down and then points out any of her concerns. If you ask her questions she will listen. I travel 30 minutes just to see her because I've seen her bedside manner with a previous patient. And she did not push any type of meds/interventions with that person. I haven't yet experience the L&D with her myself but I am sure it would be great experience & I will be back to rate her on that. As far as waiting time, that is the ONLY thing I dread! But you know what she is worth the wait because she is the best. I mean you can't expect to be seen in 5/10 minutes as soon as you arrive. That means she takes time with each patient which is the best thing any dr can do. The waiting area is VERY small. The staff are not bad at all. The receptionist is ok but she needs to be more nicer. As far as the nurse back there! She is just as nice as Dr. Triche."

I called the office with a complaint of a side effect to the BC he prescribed. I was told it was not possible since ""out of my 30 year experience have never heard that happen"". Then when I asked what I could do they did not give me a referral and said its not a gynecological issue so I dont know, sorry. What kind of nonsense is that?? Well I got a second opinion and what do you know: the terrible side effect is gone now that I stopped the med you prescribed.Besides my 30 second pelvic exam and terrible service from the staff I would say stay far away from this office and see a doctor that actually cares."

Given my age and health conditions, I thought I needed someone high risk and Dr. Iyabode seemed to have good reviews on a few sites online so I decided to try her out. She spent a lot of time with me (probably 40 minutes) but she spent all but about 5 of that trying to convince me to get lap band surgery. I seriously contemplated whether or not she had a deal worked out with a lap band surgeon to get something out of it! She swore 4 times (I don’t at all so that was extra tough to hear) and she spoke so negatively about family in general. I would never go back to her and I would never recommend her.

She did an amazing job with my prenatal care and even referred me to a specialist once we discovered my first born had a birth defect. Without her fast thinking, the outcome could have been detrimental to her development and survival. During the delivery, we were never pressured to have a c-section, and she allowed the baby to come in its own time. I have recommended her to other friends, and no one has ever been disappointed.

He may be in and out of his office like the other person said but when that occurs it usually means he is delivering or helping someone on the labor and delivery floor of the hospital, he can't predict when he will be needed. He gave me a chance to deliver the baby naturally when most others wouldn't of in that circumstance, it did take a lot of work on both of our parts to make that happen and I greatly appreciate it. When it comes down to it, this is the doctor you want in the delivery room. He spent his time to make sure I knew what was going on and talked to us about our concerns. A good doctor"

The staff is rude and everyone is rushed. There is 1 Appointment nurse for all 3 locations, for the 4 doctors. She is overwhelmed and has messed up my appointments and doesn't return calls. Dr. Todd Holt is nice, don't get me wrong, but is in and out. They run you through like cattle. The last straw was my annual exam. I got a call saying the sample wasn't enough to evaluate and I need to return in 4 months. This is now MORE lab work to pay for. Because it is now time to go see him again, I have left multiple msgs to set an appt and no call back. I'm done."

She may know her field, I am not sure but I have never had a doctor be so rude. She tried to break my water and was really hurting me and I had already had two babies so I was not a stranger to delivery. She pretty much called me a baby and was very put off when I told her to stop and give the epidural first. She did what I asked but it was obvious she was busy and I was wasting her time. She did a great job at the c section and her attitude changed when the other doctors were in the room."

I was so disgusted after about 15-30 minutes that I handed them back their paperwork and left. When you walk in it feels sort of like walking into an autoparts store. There are three seperate lines with no signs, etc. to help you guess which one to get in. It's so crowded that there's no open chairs in either waiting room. Their does appear to be different treatment if you're pregnant. There is something wrong with the world when half of the chairs in a GYNECOLOGISTS office are filled with men, while women stand in the waiting area. I think out of both waiting rooms I might have seen one other person who wasn't obviously pregnant. I had a problem with filling out paperwork re: sexual history, periods, abortions, etc. with a man standing with his shoulders squished up against mine, able to read over my shoulder. That was what finally pushed me past my point of tolerance. WILL NEVER GO BACK!"

I agree that she has horrible bed side manner but that was something that I could deal with. The wait time was absolutely ridiculous. Every visit I would always wait for at least 2 hours. I am now switching doctors because of her I miscarried my daughter at 17 weeks. Then afterwards they gave me the run around when I wanted my baby's autopsy reults. After reading the results I discovered it was due to an infection of the placenta, but when they read the report to me over the phone they stated that everything was normal.

She is listed as one who specializes in high risk, maternal fetal medicine etc even on her own page. I am expecting twins so I called to see if I could transfer to her.I am in my first trimester. After much wasting of my time, she called and spoke with me letting me know that she cannot take me because I am refusing to have a c section. This Dr doesn't even want you to try before making a decision. I believe all her glorfied reviews were written by someone from her office. This is a doctor that is afraid of a challenge. I had my fisrt child with no issues and without a C section, why wouldn't I want to try until it is absolutely necessary for a C section. She did the same thing to a sister of min and turned her down without even seeing her saying her pregnanacy was high risk. She used a a different Dr and an uneventful birth, with no problems.Patients beware, call her at your own risk."

If I knew she was gonna move away and she was gonna drop my treatment I would’ve never chosen her as my doctor . She didn’t have the professionalisms ethics and integrity to be honest and led me on to start a treatment with her knowing she was not gonna be there for me and move away . She caused me emotional distress made me waste time effort and money . The first IUI her staff made us wait an hour outside and she didn’t supervised that all the tests my insurance required in order to cover it were done by her staff . The secon IUI she sent her assistant to perform it and she didn’t even show up. Just TERRIBLE doctor.

Doctor Breazeale deemed it necessary to break the mother's water. The mother cried, ""No, no, I don't want that!"" while her labor support persons also cried no. Doctor Breazeale broke her water anyway, while the mother cried no. The mother felt violated and wept. She shut down entirely for the rest of her labor and it ended in c-section, preformed by Doctor Breazeale. She had not discussed the benefits or risks of breaking mother's water. When she heard the mother say no, she acted even more quickly. There was not an emergency at this time. This is a blatant violation of informed consent, and being that it was also an action inside of a laboring mother's privates, it is considered medical sexual violation. Every laboring woman has the basic human right to say no and be heard. Doctor Breazeale seems not to believe this."

I was in the hospital for 3 long days before having to have a cesarean. Once my cesarean was completed I did not see nor hear from my doctor until 5 WEEKS LATER!! After my surgery was completed she never once came to my recovery room, never came to speak to me after the surgery, and never told me I needed to follow up with her 2 weeks after. A family member told me 5 weeks after having my baby that I was supposed to have a 2 week check up. I called Dr. Thompson’s office and they scheduled me to come in. Once there Dr. Thompson never checked my scar, never confirmed I healed properly, nothing! When telling her my concerns with how I was feeling with postpartum depression and being overwhelmed she simply said “it will get better” and left the room. I did not feel taken care of, honestly after she got her delivery fee taken care of and the delivery of my baby I didn’t hear from her anymore. I will NEVER use her again.

I wias told to come 30mins ahead of my appointment which I did but was seen almost 2 hrs later. It has been that way every single time. When I complained about it I was told she liked to spend more time with pregnant women. After an almost 2 hrs wait I was only seen for like 5 mins. I just think pregnant or not, you should not take an appointment you cannot fulfill. Secondly, on my 3rd appointment there, I wanted her to discus my test result from the previous appointment, but she refused and was told to set up another appointment specifically for that.
I had pain on my right pelvic area, she said it was just ovulation pain after she made me do an ultrasound in her office. They would not let me do it anywhere else. The ultrasound lady was nice, but they were wrong, because I went for a second opinion and found a hernia.
I just think they are all money crazy now and care less about the patient.

I am a new patient and have been to her office several times for my prenatal care. Everytime I go to the office the front desk clerk responds promplty and she is very courteous. The staff throughout the center are just wonderful. Dr. Chelu is very knowledgeable in her area of studies and she always gives her undivided attention to any concerns I have. I couldn't have made a better decision on selecting a doctor for my pregnancy!!!!!
2016,Dr. Laura Chelu,Houston,Texas,Gynecologist (OBGYN), Female,3,3,2011-11-21T21:31:27Z,3,4,4,1,3,"It was a very disapointing visit. My current condition doesn't allow me to have sex easily, because of pain. And even though technically she knew about this condition, she didn't offer a concrete help. She was more worried for my husband not having sex, than finding a relief of my pain. She told me that I must have sex with my husband otherwise somebody else will give it to him! So the best help she can give was lidocaine to numb my vulva, and she told me that I will not feel anything during sex, but at least my husband will! I told her that it might be difficult to have sex without feeling it! She replied: "" I can't not fix everything""! She has been the least professional doctor I have ever seen in my life. I frankly don't have any respect for this person, and will hapilly ignore her comments. I just would like the community to be aware of this unprofessional person."

I went in with a kidney infection during my pregnancy I always get them during pregnancy so I know the symptoms, I told her what was wrong and she dismissed it as back pain which according to her was normal during pregnancy. I had never before suffered back pain but I knew it wasn't it. Her thermometer was also semi working and she said I had a mild fever but sent me home with Tylenol. I warned her that my infections get so bad during my pregnancy I end up at the ER and she still dismissed me. Fast forward a few hours I had a 104 fever at home and had to rush to the ER. Unfortunately, she was still the doctor on call and guess what...gave me MORE TYLENOL! a day later a specialist saw me and freaked out because they had not been able to bring my fever down. He had all sorts of tests ran and gave me IV antibiotic, infection had traveled to my lungs and he said it was close to my heart. I placed a complaint with the office manager who took about a week to return my calls and placed a complaint. I would not recommend Dr. Rosenstock to anyone."

I had an IUD inserted and even though I asked questions to prepare I felt she lied to me about the pain. Also, she did not seem to feel much empathy for me when I was agonizing while having the IUD inserted--her nurse on the other hand seemed to care way more. Won't be recommending her to anyone or returning to this doctor. Her age shows her lack of experience. "

Rosenstock,Houston,Texas,Gynecologist (OBGYN), Female,8,2.31,2016-07-06T16:48:22.307Z,2,5,1,1,1,"Took appt with Rosenstock as as 'first available' since I had a breast lump that I needed a doctor referral in order to schedule a diagnostic mammogram. I arrived early for her first appt of the day, and was quickly processed by her staff, then escorted to the Dr's office to wait for her. I passed her in the hallway where she was chatting with a staff member. I waited for 45 minutes past my appointment time before she finally entered her office to meet with me. She treated me rather distainfully because I had not had a mammogram before. Then she did a quick manual exam of my breast and wrote up the prescription for a mammogram. When the results for the mammogram came in, she did not call me, she had her nurse call me to read word for word the report (which I could have done myself). I had pre-paid for a standard office visit, and the bill came for ""New patient, moderate to high severity problem comp"", for which an additional amount was due. I protested the charge with the billing office, and was given a partial adjustment, but still had to pay an addition $75. I received little if any service or expertise from this doctor, and resent that she was there in the suite, but knowingly kept me waiting for 45 minutes. I did not like her attitude toward me, and feel I was taken advantage of for ""high severity"" problem which she did nothing to diagnose or counsel for. I would not recommend this doctor, and will not return."

Rosenstock,Houston,Texas,Gynecologist (OBGYN), Female,8,2.31,2015-08-16T19:00:32.212Z,1.8,2,3,1,1,"At 31 weeks of pregnancy I've had to find another Ob/gyn because Dr. Rosenstock wants to put me on dangerous medicine. When I asked her if it has any side effects her answer was ""Nope, just lowers blood sugars"" but she is incorrect. It turns out the side effects of the medication she perscribed me are: nausea, heartburn, stomach fullness, weight gain, sore throat, fever, bleeding easily, bruising, stomach pain, yellowing of the eyes and skin, unusual tiredness, mood changes, swelling of the hands and feet and seizures. Also, I have read about studies that have been done on the effects of the fetus while using this medication (glyburide). They have concluded that it passes through the placenta to the fetus and affects how the baby's pancreas works. Chances are high that the baby could get diabetes sometime in life due to this drug. I AM JUST NOT WILLING TO PUT MY UNBORN CHILD'S HEALTH AT RISK. Especially since my sugars ate controlled with a healthy diet. I URGE YOU TO DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH IF DR. ROSENSTOCK PERSCRIBES A MEDICATION TO YOU BECAUSE I JUST DONT THINK SHE'S A VERY GOOD DOCTOR. A second incident was when I had a sore throat so I called Dr. ROSENSTOCK'S office and talked to her nurse. I could hardly speak because of the pain in my throat and I sound horrible. I asked Amanda (nurse) if she could ask Dr. Rosenstock to prescribe something for me. Her answer was ""Well have you looked at the list of medications that you could take in the folder we gave you? Well she was of no help and I could tell by the tone in her voice that she was not going to be of any help, so I just immediately drove myself to my family doctor let them know that I was pregnant and the pain that I was having and my family doctor is the one who prescribe something for me because I had strep throat. I wish I would have found a different doctor sooner. Dr. Rosenstock and her nurse are not very good. You will definitely have to second guess what these two say and do your own research."

I love Dr Kuhn and have been going to him for 20+ years but his current staff is just not as helpful as the staff he had several years back. Dr Kuhn is very knowledgeable is always able to answer all my questions in-depth. I understood all my options fully and he really took the time to make sure my questions were answered.

His attitude is kind of demanding of both staff and patients AND the procedures are rough!! I felt like I was alone and had no support as I was going through pain and strong discomfort.

After surgery through a different doctor, he is recovered and his sperm quality looks fantastic. As far as the billing is concerned, we are still getting bills two years later. All of my husband semen analysis was paid up front but we are still getting billed for it. They have tried to charge me for the same analysis 3 different times.

After surgery, she did not visit me nor did she speak with my friends in the waiting room. Because I had become so cold, shivering, during surgery, nurses used heaters to warm me. Calls were not returned by her but rather, after days, by a curt nurse that seemed put-off by my inquires. For the follow-up, she did not allow questions, saying that she would do the talking. It was 2 weeks before I knew the results of my surgery. My concerns re conflict with medication and condition were later justified by another Dr. She was pleasant on the 1st visit, however, all others revealed a coarse, arrogant personality. For the last appointment, after an approx 2 hr wait, she spent less than 5 min with me, with the assumption she was over booked. I always experienced at least a 30 min. wait @ appointments. Her beauty line is an additional irritation which I found unprofessional, considering I was intending to resolve gynecological issues - not receive cosmetic guidance."

She has also been to eager to write a prescription, for many pills in a filling, and not be responsible for monitoring progress with medications. She is not very pleasant during visits, and herself and her staff try to push her line of ""beauty"" products more than the needed and wanted healthcare. I will never see Dr. Kimberly Brady again."

in the last week
I'm so glad and fortunate to have Dr Brandi Compton-Joseph (Dr. CJ) as my OBGYN. She accepted me at 36 weeks as I had to leave my previous doctor and Dr Compton assured me that the baby was healthy. I delivered a healthy baby at full term with no problems what so ever. She was so caring and always gave me logical and professional answers to my questions. She gained my trust and I do recommend her as a honest, humble, and caring OBGYN who is also extremely good at what she does. Thank you Dr Compton-Joseph for all of your help and I could not be happier having you as my OBGYN.

I had a healthy pregnancy, but I could tell she wanted to do a C-section from week 30. She wanted to induce me early because she thought the baby was too big. Baby was measuring normal. I was not high risk. No gest DM either. Thank god I went with my instincts and waited and baby came on her own time. Went into labor at 5 AM. Dr.Nanda didn't arrive until 930AM, started me on Pitocin, I was at 4cm, and she told me baby is in distress. by 1030 she wanted me to get a c-section. by 11 I was on the table. by 12 baby was out. I wasn't even told but there was a male doc taking out the baby while she was by his side.
If you need to held by a doc at every step, don't go with Dr.Nanda. If you want someone to help get you pregnant and cut that baby out of you, go with Dr. Nanda. "

I trust her completely with my babies and has done a wonderful job. I personally find her sweet and friendly.

I was highly dissatisfied with the service I received the moment I walked in this office. So much so that a voice inside of my head viciously nagged me to postpone my appointment. I have always received normal pap smear results and the appointment was to discuss further action due to abnormal results. Before I go on to pick apart my visit with Dr. Nanda, I have to mention that my gynecologist who owns a practice in the Bellaire area and referred me to Dr. Nanda has much to be desired. However I stuck with this gynecologist because that is where my mother goes. Her bedside manner is my biggest grievance. Moving on, when I walked into Dr. Nanda's office, the window was open but the woman did not address me so it took me a while to figure out exactly what I was supposed to do, which was to fill out a rectangular slip of paper and go have a seat. I was attended to and was told to wait in a glass room until further notice. Also, I am sure the day I scheduled my appointment for and they told me it wasn't until the next day. After speaking with another doctor and expressing how anxious I was due to my abnormal results, we decided to proceed with a colposcopy. I felt extremely pressured to say the least and even cried when everyone, (not one person) the entire front desk announced Dr. Nanda was available like it was a festivity. That made me more anxious and I cried even more but there was no time to recollect as I was walked back. In came Dr. Nanda and I was obviously distraught but her demeanor was so offputting. There was no genuine exchange AT ALL. All she did was look at my abnormal lab results and rushed the equipment to be put in the room. At one point she even spoke to me like I was a child ending her sentences with upward inflections, which infuriated me because I am paying for this procedure I am not a child. After the procedure was done she was gone in a flash and I was furious. my procedure was done the first week of February and it is Feb. 18th and I have yet to receive a call from her or her nurse who never answers the phone and has yet to follow up with me after leaving messages. Doctors team up and pull fast ones to get people's money and I was nothing but a walking dollar sign."

They said the baby is too big but he was just the average in everything. And by the way, she was out with her friends having a good time while I was being forced to deliver early by the nurses who had specific instructions and she just came for a few minutes in the middle of everything and never came back after delivery too. I will never forgive her. I really believe this woman and Noelle Niemand should be in prison!"

She did a c section on me and left horrible scars. Right after the surgery she got on the plane and left to New York. I never saw her again, she left me under the care of another doctor (wonderful doctor by the way, and he became my Obgyn). After her messed up c section I develop a almost deadly infection and I had to go back to the hospital for almost ten days, leaving my new born baby with my husband at home. I should had sued this monster they call Dr. Fulton, but that is ok. I am glad she got on that plane and left me under someone’s else care. I gave a beautiful family now, after that I had 2 more beautiful children. The Lord has blessed me tremendously despite of this monster who operated on me years ago. Just be careful with her.

She continued to yell asking what tests I needed. I had no idea- I wasn't the doctor! She finally figured it out and asked if I had eaten anything that morning. I replied yes and she proceeded to tell me that I had ruined my chances of getting the tests done since I needed to have an empty stomach. No one had told me this prior to coming in.

Mitchell didn't even ask me how I was doing through the whole procedure. She was at one point talking about her vacation plans to her assistant.Who thank God was a Doctor. And, thank god for the caring nurse. Who painstakingly counted every item sponges, rags over and over to make sure there was no error. Because I had a C-section before insurance didn't cover this baby. We paid all the expenses before in cash. We didn't pay the anesthesiologist:700. This man messed up on my epidermal/I was feeling everything! He asked during the surgery why we had not paid. I was horrified. Mitchell said nothing. So, I felt helpless.

The only respond she could give is"" I don't understand what you want to me"" . She is a clueless doctor who shouldn't be seeing patients all even if its to put a bandage on a paper cut. If you can't understand a patient's reason for a office visit.I WILL NOT BE RETURNING"

She delivered my daughter and she was very helpful and knowledgable the entire pregnacy. We emailed back and forth the entire pregnacy and I couldn't imagine myself with another OBGYN. I will say that sometimes the wait is a little long even when you have an appointment but other than that great doctor!

I e-mailed to ask whether I could wait until I was no longer on temporary insurance, which was 2 months, to which she didn't respond. I called the nurses and asked for an answer, no response. Meanwhile, the scheduling department sent me two form letters to schedule the appointment. Finally, the scheduling office sent me a letter firing me as a patient. I e-mailed Dr. Kim to tell her personally that there was no communication between her nurse line and scheduling department. All she responded was that she would forward my e-mail to the office manager to see if we could repair the relationship. The office manager did call me, but I was done by that point. After all this, I went to another OB-GYN who looked at my records who carefully and kindly told me that a recommendation for further testing was based on outdated medical standards. That second doctor was Tiffany Mullins. Go to her."

As she was doing the exam, her nurse went to open the door and nearly let every one have a free show until Dr. Kim told her to close the door and wait a second. The lady that took my blood was absolutely RUDE! When Dr. Kim told me I had an abnormal result, I had to make another appointment and paid another copay just for her to read me my results. When discussing the abnormal result, she barely took any time to answer my questions, many of which she left unanswered or said she ""didn't know why"" and also even had the gull to say ""I don't know what to tell you."" She was more concerned about the visiting doctors from other hospitals than she was with me, HER PATIENT, and tried to hurry along the process so she could go talk with them. I left her office feeling extremely upset and still had many questions that remained unanswered."

She was absolutely the worst doctor I've experienced in my life. Rude, crude, zero compassion. I'm was recommended to her during my first pregnancy with my son. Later in my pregnancy I developed horrible complications (extremely high blood pressure, episodes of passing out, etc) and not only did she ever address or treat the issue but she flat out treated me poorly because I was having these symptoms. Accused me of ""being weak"" (as in wimp), ""suck it uo and deal with it"", and even suggested once that I was exaggerating my symptoms (I'm not sure how one can exaggerate high blood pressure and loss of consciousness...) because I was just lazy and wanted to stay home from work. OUTRAGEOUS behavior from a doctor.
Oh, and upon having my gender reveal ultrasound, I found out I was having a boy and she said to me ""don't worry we can always get rid of that"" going on to tell me most women prefer ""girls"". SICK, OUTRAGEOUS, DISGUSTING HUMAN BEING OF A DOCTOR."

Unfortunately, my husband and I were not fond of her bedside manner, or lack thereof. I was having an issue with a recurrent cyst that the doctor did not believe I had--she turned to my husband and asked him if he had witnessed the lump I was referring to. In addition, her examination was very rough and painful. We have changed doctors since this first crude visit."

I waited for 2 hours today and was seen for for about 3-5 minutes. This is very poor customer service, particularly that I offered to come back within 10 minutes if they gave me a call, after the 30 minute mark. Instead, they kept me waiting, I guess their time is more valuable than mine. After years of going to Dr. Swaim, following her wherever she moved, now in her new location at Baylor...it might be just time to switch. She also appears to be rushed and does not come across as very sensitive when communicating with the patient."

I try not to let Google be my source of info because there is sooooo much out there that is not all accurate or simply opinions so in turn I trust the process with my doctor and her staff but yet it's a flop. It's important as the expert to fill in your patient as you go through it together. Don't just do whatever, slap me on the back and tell me ""see you next week!"" What did I just go through and why did you do that and what should I consider or expect for the next time?

Since I had already been drugged they had to keep me in the recovery area until my mom came back to pick me up. They gave me a partial refund and then shoved me out the back door.

Later when we meet in his office, he spoke to me with the most unfriendly tone. I then began to laugh to stop my self from getting angry. He then said that it was not funny and that he just had an abortion that went bad and that I am wasting his time since he has a serious matter at hand. I was there for a regular well woman exam; I didn't know that they did abortions out there."

There was an accident on 59, and this is in a notoriously high traffic area in the medical center. I called ahead saying that I might be 30 minutes late. They said that it was OK, so I continued to their office. When I got there I paid for parking and walked in, and apparently they decided to wait until I walked into the office to tell me that the doctor will not see me because I wasn't on time. Dr. Bump can make you wait indefinitely, but if you happen to be late for any reason you won't be seen. What's even worse is that the staff just let me drive the rest of the way and pay for parking. If you are looking for a compassionate doctor, I wouldn't start with her."

She was very impersonal, did not take my medical history prior to the exam but briefly after, and the exam only lasted a few minutes. I had to pay prior to the exam, which I have never had to do before. Also, when the nurse called about test results she gave me a vague answer as to what the results were. I am someone who likes to be informed with as much information as possible, and for me, this was unacceptable. I need a doctor who is truly interested in me as a person and is in invested in me. I did not get this feeling from this doctor."

I was never called with results of my blood tests, ones that determined if my pregnancy was still viable. I always had to track them down and that sometimes took days, which was agonizing. Most appointments took several hours, even if it was just a follow-up visit (no exams). The entire process took over a month instead of a couple weeks. Its been very emotional and painful to deal with. I felt like no one would give me a straight answer. It just felt like the patient load was too much and there wasn't enough time to deal with my situation."

I arrived at 9:50 for a 10:00 appointment. I texted my sister at 10:19 to let her know I was still waiting to see him. When he finally comes in, he says ""I'm giving you a referral."" He said I need to see them as soon as possible. I asked if they worked out of M D Anderson. He said they did. He said make an appointment with the staff. I asked why. ""so you don't fall through the cracks"", he said. Then he ushers me out of the room and tells me to go to the window in the waiting room and they would give me the Dr's info and make my next appt. No mention of the BIOPSY! No mention of CANCER! No mention of RESULTS! NO CONSULTATION at all! The nurse at the window gives me my parking validation and the dr's info written on a post-it note and run off on the copier. She puts it in an envelope and hands it to me. When I look in the envelope after I leave his office, I find the results of my biopsy in the bag. I have INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA. BREAST CANCER!!! And this is the treatment I get from my doctor! When I called the number, they first tell me that ""this is not a Breast cancer Dr. But we have doctors here who do treat Breast Cancer"". And ""no, none of them work out of M D Anderson"". I did get registered at M D Anderson, no thanks to DR UBESIE. "

If you are having any complications with your pregnancy, please find another doctor. I had complications beginning at 7wks.

Although I buried my father Feb. 7th, I was able to make the appointment because I needed a prescription. When I arrived the computers were down and no one had a schedule of who you were there to see for your appointment. The exam was silent and horrible. The doctor didn't tell me when he was going to begin and when he was going to end. I am a teacher and if I feel as though I'm going to do my class a diservice I will not be in that profession. I will never use this doctor again."

I only went to him or even went back to him because a friend recommened him. My questions never really got answered. By week 15 in my pregnancy I wasnt feeling well I was running a fever of 103. So I went in to TX womens hospiatl and he was on call. As soon as he walked in he hit me over the head with his clip board! I kid you not! Hit me over the head with his clip board and said I was the dumbest of his patients. And that I probley had the Flu and would DIE! Becasue I Didnt get vaccinated How was I to know when he never told me to! He wanted me in the hospiatl for 3 days ith no vistiors and on Flu Medication. I started crying and he told me if you dont like my care Find another doctor its a big city go. So that night I did I went to a family doc and found out it wasnt the flu!!!

I was lucky if I got back to see him by 11am. I would be undressed from waist down waiting on him in teh rom four about another 30-45 min. EVERYTIME he saw me for m pregnancy i had to remind him how far I was, that I had a prior C-Section, when i was due, and what I was even having. I had 4 untra sounds done by him and each time I was told i was having a girl, I had a 3d done as a momento and my girl had a few extra parts. I bbrought the picture in and he told me the place I had it done was wrong that it is a girl. I had a C-Section scheduled for 6am, he told me to be there at 4am. The hospital wasnt even expecting me till 5:30. He just about ran me over in the parking garage on his way in at 5am (i left to go get some extra items for my stay). My hospital stay, he kept me on IV diet 2 days after i had my son, and liquid diet for 2 more days. I DO NOT ADVISE ANYONE TO USE HIM!"

He very quickly dismissed my wife's concerns, assuring us some birth control would fix her previously diagnosed endometriosis. It's worth noting he did not diagnose it. This didn't work, and he insisted to just keep trying it or to go into surgery which may or may not do anything. He and his staff never seemed to care that she had previously had an ovarian cyst removed and some endometriosis that the surgeon (Geri Fromm, excellent!) was taken out in the process. They never wanted her surgical files or anything. When complaining about her pain, he gave her an rx for ibuprofen. In a follow up telling him that didn't work, he blew her off and gave her nothing else. If you want a quick ""well woman"" exam, I'm sure he's fine, but if you have any real issues don't expect any help."

1) He was extremely brusque and unpleasant. He talked down to me and treated me like I was completely incompetent, smirking every time I answered his questions. He refused to believe me when I told him I was in my second trimester, even though I had been under the care of my previous OB/GYN (before we moved to Houston) and I knew my due date (and it turned out I was right).
2) He made me feel very uncomfortable. When I had my ultrasound, they told me to undress on bottom but didn’t mentioned they needed to do a breast exam too. When he came into the room, I was still wearing my shirt and undergarment. When I realized what he planned to do, I said I would need to finish undressing so could he please come back in a moment. He smirked at me and said he “had plenty of experience taking off bras.” Exact words. It made me feel really gross and I did not like him touching me.
3) I was still nursing my 2nd baby while pregnant with my 3rd, on the approval of my OB/GYN before we moved, and I was making sure to get enough calories and nutrients, taking vitamins, etc. Dr. Law told me that I was, “starving my unborn baby.” I politely disagreed, as I have many friends who are OB/GYNs and the current research shows that it is perfectly fine to nurse while pregnant as long as you eat enough.

Zhou & her office don't communicate well, act distant, & give low quality service. Originally, when I first set the appointment, I booked a different doctor for back-up. I'm glad I had the back-up. We waited long times, over an hour or two just to see the doctor despite our appointment. And that was before we got into the patient room. We waited an additional long time for her when we were finally seated. I felt like she forgot about us or just didn't care. I had to look for her! When I found her, she basically shrugged us off and told us to continue to wait. When I asked if she had any refreshments for the long wait, she arrogantly and bluntly said no while she continued to walk off.
Much of her staff is rude & uncourteous except for Marisol. She follows through and is considerate. Later on we also found additional charges nearly a $1000 extra that was not communicated to us we would be charged for. When I called their office with questions multiple times for Zhou and one of her nurses (Wendy?), they don't return calls.
Sometimes you read bad reviews and want to give the benefit of the doubt, and it's so sad when they are true. Don't support this business!"

To the point I had to address his behavior with him & let me tell you that only made it worse, while I remained calm the doctor became agressive as like if he was trying to provoke an argument , it was so pathetic that he tried to threaten me to abandon my treatment at 36 weeks pregnant & for me to go have my baby at Ven Tab hospital & that he could go & say he abandoned treatment because he felt threatened. Right there & then I knew that was it , I actually put up with his rudeness , bad moods, sarcasm but that was it when he went that low to tell me this things, those were his actual words. He left me so speechless that I just decided to leave , did not argue with him at all , I let him argue with him self & then he literally followed me to the exit & stood there starring at me while I asked the nurses for the TEXAS MEDICAL BOARD information that should always be on display & was NOT & the nurses very nicely offered to provide me the right information since they notice that it was NOT display as they thought it was & then the doctor interfered & said NO don't give her anything she can go ahead & google it . Not even then I argued with him about information that as a patient I have the right to , I just left . I mean the list goes on & on but I can only imagine how many other patients have not said anything & are being treated this way. I hope this is helpful you guys. Now I need to find a doctor to continue my treatment "

Very unprofessional and a real a__ hole!!!! Barely said Hi when he walked through the door then his next words were I was not the right fit for his practice because I was high risk due to being diabetic. But he would take me on and if I messed up once then he would fire me as a patient. Then he started yelling at me about my medications because I did not know the specifics of them. Then he was telling the nurse loudly about my issues where all nurses and patients could here! I would not recommend this doctor to my worst enemy!!

When I asked to repeat herself, she seemed offended. Sticking to the local MDs where language is not a barrier. I also posted on vitals to get the word out."

I'd get a refund of my copay if I could. She left the room without even saying goodbye. Who does she think she is? Being an MD doesn't give you license to be arrogant, especially if you can't do anything for a patient and can't even respect that they have a valid concern about their health. Does she think women just love to go to GYNs for no reason at all? Really? Worst experience with the doctor, no compassion or concern, or sufficient knowledge to form judgement."

Without my consent, Dr. Haufrect sent some ""lab tests"" to get done and I got a bill afterwards for ~$1000. I never ordered extra tests, nor did he/his nurse inform me of the tests being done and how expensive they would be. What's worse, despite claiming these tests were necessary and refusing to refund me, they never even called me to give me the results!! If the test was so necessary, why didn't they tell me they were doing the test and why didn't they give me the results?! CRAZY! LITERALLY HE STOLE $1000 FROM ME (and I have good insurance)!! HOW IS THIS LEGAL?

I came in with very personal medical issues that were affecting my life as a woman and she invalidated my concerns and talked to me like I don't have any problems. I felt that she lacks compassion and consideration for patient's sufferings. I don't know why people like that become doctors. I felt humiliated leaving that office after she and her assistant looked at me, talked about me and not only offered no help but made me feel like I should suck it up and live with my issues. I had to have a surgery done to restore my health and to have my life back and to that Dr my problems meant nothing."

My very first visit with her was for a second opinion in regards to heavy bleeding that I had been having for 6+ weeks. During the appointment she was very nice and seemed somewhat like she knew what she was talking about. Her phone continued to ring throughout my appointment in which finally she answered it and disappeared for about 5 minutes. She expressed concern for my high blood pressure and the possibility of chronic hypertension. She needed my medical records in order to diagnose that. Those were never requested from my doctor and nothing was ever said to me about filling out a form until 4 days after my initial appointment. All in the meantime she had put me on a birth control that would hopefully help. I called the office the very next day and left a message with her assistant wanting to know if it was normal for the bleeding to get worse. The assistant called back later that day saying the doctor had already left and that she would call me the next morning. No call came from the doctor the next morning. In fact no call came from the doctor until about 5 minutes before closing on the Thursday before Good Friday. When she did call back she recommended increasing my dose to 3 pills a day vs. the 1 pill a day. When I mentioned to her about my high blood pressure and said I was concerned she did tell me that it might cause a problem. What kind of doctor tells you to do something that MIGHT cause a problem? DO NOT GO SEE HER! Very young, not very knowledgeable and highly unprofessional. "

I was very impressed at our first meeting, but soon after I discovered she is self-righteous, self-centered, incompetent, unreliable and dishonest. Do NOT depend on her to be in your corner when needed, return phone calls, relay reports and information to your other doctors or consider your needs a priority. She will fail you, her staff will fail you and you will be lost in a sea of one catastrophic debacle after another - with NO apology, satisfactory treatment or resolution from her camp! Beware that Dr. Rhodes scheduled a very expensive test that was NOT requested, authorized or required for my particular case. She never even told me she was going to order the test. When I asked the nurse why I had to take it I was told, “Well, you’ve never had one done before.” The test had absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with my condition. It appeared it was thrown in just to add more dollars to my bill."

My mom needed to urgently get in to see DR.ZAID after a preliminary diagnosis of uterine cancer. She had to wait until the following week to get in. On Wednesday she gave the office her atena insurance information and they claimed to verify it. She shows up for her appointment on Monday ( very nervous and after a very long week of waiting) to find out that after an hour of waiting in office that they would not see her due to them not accepting Aetna any longer as of Thursday. They were ""sorry"" and the reason they didn't catch it is because they checked her insurance on Wednesday and decided to not take hers any longer on Thursday.
This wasn't an appointment for something minor, but for an advanced late stage cancer that had just been diagnosed! TIME IS SO IMPORTANT AND THEY WASTED ANOTHER PRECIOUS WEEK OF TIME BY BEING CARELESS! Then sent her away and told her to call the back of her insurance card to see if her insurance could help her find someone. HEARTLESS
So now we are waiting to see when another doctor can get her in, which prolonged this even further. I understand doctors stop accepting insurances but in a case as severe as this, they should have made sure they could see her before making her wait a week, go to the appointment, wait and hour at the appointment, then call her up to tell her that she couldnt be seen! RUTHLESS CARELESS HEARTLESS PEOPLE!"

During a so-called routine surgery after a miscarriage, Dr. Ng damaged my inner organs so significantly during the procedure that I am no longer able to have children. The condition her treatment caused is called Asherman's, or intrauterine scarring.
I have since been in treatment with specialists for the condition who have confidently confirmed that it was clearly Dr. Ng who is responsible for the damage, which was entirely avoidable. Please do not let her perform surgery on you – I know reviews always sound a bit crazy, but if I can only save one person from what I have to go through, it is worth the effort."
