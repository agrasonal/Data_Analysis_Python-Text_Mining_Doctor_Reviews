I would like to respond to that person who reported that doctor elder he applied many times to his board and didn't pass it. and waited two hour then, seen by the doctor for 5 minutes. I would like to reply to that person and say. first, it 's better to see by the doctor for 5 minutes and gives a good explanation and good result better to see by the doctor for 15 minutes without knowledge and doesn't know how to get his degree and give you a guessing explanation. second, of course you 're an educated person, when some body didn't pass board exam for many times . the department of board exam doesn't let take the board again, ( if I am correct like the other certificate). please , people when you say something about ur doctor say logic things. not something never believe. finally , I am patient of doctor elder, he is an excellent, knowledgeable, caring doctor. if up to me i'll give him a doctor of the year in the whole world :))"

I have never before interacted with such a helpful MD. He goes out of his way to give us complete information. In a time of rushed doctors, he makes us feel at ease as my father struggles with numerous complications. His bedside manner is the best! I would definitely recommend him to anyone. It is reassuring to see him smile, even when the news isn't always easy."
12,Dr. Zaid Alirhayim,Detroit,Michigan, Cardiologists , Male,6,4.75,2012-11-04T09:37:35Z,5,5,5,5,5,"I'm an RN working at Henry Ford. Dr.A is my favorite doctor. He is intelligent, kind and easy on the eyes. He treated my cousin at the hospital and she had only good things to say. I also had the chance to closely observe him on the Oncology ward. His genuine committment to patients and their health is why his patients love him. I would recommend him to any of my relatives."

He looks too young to be a doctor but don't let that fool you. He always has a smile when he come in the room, is thorough and is never rushed or impatient to leave the room as some doctors are. He is a smart caring guy and i made my husband switch over to him."

He won't make that extra effort if it means going out of his way. He will straight up ask you if ""money is an issue"" before treatment. I was shocked. If you call his office to see if you can speak to a doctor or come in that day (non emergency but concerned) they will just send you to ER and then later the doc will say you should have come into the office. Don't go here. I'm switching."
17,Dr. Mouhammed Joumaa,Roseville,Michigan, Cardiologists , Male,6,4.17,2013-11-07T08:10:32Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Joumaa is a knowledgeable cardiologist who makes his patients feel like they are friends or family relative to his level of concern for them. And - he actually sits down in a hospital room and explains his findings, reasons for treatments, answers questions, and never hurries you off. His art of care is part of his healing quality. His science of care is excellent & well thought through. A fine doctor."

Dr. K has been my cardiologist for 15 years. He's friendly unless you're obnoxious.

I waited 1 hour then the receptionist called out to all of the patients to let then know, that the doctor was not going to make it because he had an emergency. I came back two weeks later. I waited 2 hours past my appt time to see the doctor. When I finally saw him, he didn't seem to listen or care, about why I had come to see him. He chastised me for smoking and treated me like I was a child. I felt as though he were blackmailing me into having numerous tests done, before he would treat me. I am not sure whether I will return to this office or not. I'll have to think about it before my next scheduled appt. Maybe I should sign in today, and then hopefully in two weeks, it will be my turn to see the doc ? My time is valuable too."

He's very popular with a large patient base and sometimes you wait. He's a good person. Gives me a hug everytime I see him. Clerical staff is marginal. Techs/Med staff are excellent.

I believe he is a good doctor and very knowlegable in the field of cardiogy. I just hate waiting an hour or two past my appointment time to see him. He needs to address that fault.
32,Dr. Randall L. Reher,Bloomfield Hills,Michigan, Cardiologists , Male,4,4.85,2013-06-22T21:33:57Z,4.5,4,4,5,5,"The best Dr I have ever seen. If I have a question after I see him, I write it out for his staff. He(not his staff) has called me at home to answer all my questions. I feel he really CARES about me. Just before Xmas 2011,I found out I had some form of cancer. I was told by a nurse (not a Dr) in the hospital and was sent home. On Dec. 29 2011 I found out it was lymphoma. On Jan 2,2012 Dr.Reher called me at home and asked if there was anything I needed or he could do. [My internist who sent me to the hospital never called.] I asked Dr. Reher to change an Rx for me and he called it in himself. While my chemo Dr. is good, Dr. Reher, My heart Dr. takes the time with me to explain what is going on with the lymphoma and how the chemo drugs effect my heart. When I thought I had heart burn, Dr. Reher knew better, and had 2 stents put in. I have never had any heart pain since."

Spent over a half hour with me and my family. Used to be a professor at the medical school and seemed to really be up to date. Off ice staff was thoughtful, caring and compassionate. He explained all testing to me and what they meant. I am very comfortable with him. Great language skills, a unique finding these days. Also, he nitified me of test results when they were back."

He has been my husband's cardiologist for 8 years and, in that time, he has treated us with nothing but respect and sincerity. Dr. Farha is not like other doctors who wizz in and out of your room. He makes you, as a patient, feel welcome and never makes you feel uncomfortable with any question no matter how trivial. I have recommended him to many relatives and friends. Prior to seeing Dr. Farha, we saw another cardiologist in Detroit who always seemed ready to run out of the room as soon as he got in. Dr. Farha has never, in my 8 years of being with him, made either me or my husband feel uncomfortable. He is a first-class doctor with a first-class attitute and the type of optimism that makes one confident that there is hope. I owe my husband's health and my sanity to him. May God bless him and his wonderful staff."

Still does my follow-up today. He treated with respect and demonstrated and excellent ""bedside manner"". Don't let the shortcomings of the office staff reflect on the doctor. I've always been treated with respect, although I will admit sometimes abruptly... but then I don't put up with this when they start getting a little pushy, I immediateley tell the doctor. All of the offices of the Woods CVIP group are somewhat the same, but the Schoenherr office is the worse...very business-like and not exactly warm to the patient. I blame this on the group's office management, not the doctors. There chief internist is among the best in the region, rated as a ""Top 100"" doctor, so I look beyond the office front-end. I've seen most of the doctors in this group, and always received excellent medical care."

I found this doctor to be very unhelpful, for the problems I was experiencing. Too many other docs to choose from. Never went back."
69,Dr. Michael F. Romanelli,Warren,Michigan, Cardiologists , Male,3,3.5,2007-05-14T17:13:36Z,5,,5,5,5,"All comments were for the STAFF not the doctor. I would highly recommend THIS DOCTOR. If it wasn't for him THOROUGHLY checking my husband's heart at 50 years old, my husband would have had a massive heart attack and died while on vacation. This EXCELLENT DOCTOR took the EXTRA TIME to check EVERYTHING. THE DOCTOR has an EXCELLENT bedside manner and welcomes questions with informative answers to help. It is the patients responsibility to follow his directions and change YOUR DIET so heart problems can be controlled. This doctor is aware of some minor staff issues and it is or probably has been taken care of. Plenty of people who do want to work courteously with patients. We were in the office 5/3/07 and were treated with courtesy and respect."

72,Dr. Pablo Reyes,Warren,Michigan, Cardiologists , Male,2,2.83,2007-05-15T04:13:40Z,4.7,,4,5,5,"The BEST doctor I ever had! Very compassionate, best bedside manner. Spent as much time with patient as they needed to discuss problem. If you call and have a question, he calls back personally and promptly. Most caring doctor. I actually looked forward to my visits with him. Then my insurance changed and I could not see him anymore. I miss him."

76,Dr. Samer Y. Kazziha,Sterling Heights,Michigan, Cardiologists , Male,3,1.42,2006-05-07T10:12:38Z,2.7,,4,1,3,"While professional, his demeanor was both sterile and callous. On both my visits to him, he came into my room, listened to my symptoms, made a snap judgement, and left immediately. He was not really willing to elaborate on his ""findings"", nor did he stick around long enough for me to ask any questions. His office charged an obscene amount of money (after insurance, approx. $240) for what amounted to a 2-minute session with the doctor. His first snap judgement resulted in a same-day, unnecessary cardiac catheterization which cost me another $1200. On my second visit, I was handed my bill to see that his service was ""counceled patient on weight loss"" - which didn't happen. After I paid my bill and was ready to leave the office, I had a nurse thrust some xeroxed AHA one-page weight loss sheets at me. Words could not express my disgust. I have cancelled my follow-up appointment, and would not recommend Dr. Kazziha to others."
