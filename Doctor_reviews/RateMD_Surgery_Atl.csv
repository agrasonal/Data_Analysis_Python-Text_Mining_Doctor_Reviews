My son was very sick for 3 months and after numerous GI specialists who wanted to diagnosis him with IBS, our pediatrician did an ultrasound and it appeared that his gallbladder was the issue, but again no specialist or CHOA ER doctor would help and were insistant that it was not the problem. Dr. Stovroff and his nurse practitioner, Farrah Patti, actually listened to the entire history and after an examination truly believed that the gallbladder needed to be removed. It has been 6 weeks and my son is back to being a normal, active, pain free kid!! We thank God for Dr. Stovroff!"

Stovroff,Atlanta,Georgia, General Surgeons , Male,31,4.87,2019-04-17T20:11:12.343Z,5,5,5,5,5,"I would like to say a big “thank you” to Dr. Mark Stovroff, and their entire office staff for providing excellent care and extraordinary results on my son’s surgery. My son is 14 years of age and we have taken him to several doctors to get opinions on his concave chest. Many doctors said it was not an issue just cosmetic. We did some investigating and found this to be Pectus and he should get pectus excavatum surgery. Not only did we want what was medically best for my son but he also wanted the surgery as soon as possible as he seemed to be self-conscious about the way it looked, it only got bigger as he grew. We went on the internet and tried to look for the best doctor who does this surgery and little did we know it was right in the same area where we lived. We met with the doctor and he knew what the condition was and he told us he has done appx 160 of these in the past. His team helped out getting everything we needed to have this done on spring break. We felt so comfortable moving forward we would have drove 1000 miles for him to do the surgery. The day came for the surgery and all went as planned, everything was just as we were told. I will tell you when you look on the internet you will be scared and we were but 1.5 hours later he came out and told us all went well. We stayed in the Hospital 2 days and on the third day my son walked out from the second floor to the car. His surgery came out so well he is now walking around in tank tops and shirtless and we now look forward in having him go to the pool again. I am so happy with the decision on having Dr. Stovroff do my sons surgery that anyone looking to have this surgery for their child and want to know anything that they can expect I would be glad to answer any questions just ask the Dr. to give them our # and call me and I will answer everything. Once again thank you and wish you well.

I needed double hernia repair and I was referred to him. From my first appointment I knew that he was the doctor for me. put me at ease answering all of my questions, day of surgery he explained the procedure thoroughly to me. After surgery I had a couple of questions, I called his office knowing that they were closed to leave a message. To my surprise doctor Storvoff answered the phone!! 
What a great doctor."

He performed an inguinal hernia surgery on our 6-month-old son and his confidence put us at such ease. He was always straightforward with us and made it very clear this was a very common and simple procedure. He stayed positive, which kept us positive! He never beat around the bush and we never felt misled in any way. His staff was also amazing—particularly Nurse Farrah and Ms. Kelsey (at the front desk). "

He has provided my son with excellent care while correcting his Pectus Excavatum, and is always the highlight of our day when we visit his office for checkups. Last week, we had our last visit with him and our Pectus journey is over. I can say now wholeheartedly that being recommended to Dr. Stovroff was truly a blessing for my son and our family. I have complete confidence in his level of commitment and expertise he brings to the children he treats."

She has done exceptionally well with her bar in the last two years, and her pectus excavatum has been beautifully corrected! Dr. Stovroff did a great job with our first daughter, and we did not hesitate to contact him when we noticed that our second daughter also appeared to have pectus excavatum. Dr. Stovroff performed the Nuss procedure on our second daughter during the summer of 2018, and we have been so happy with her recovery and results also! Thankfully, no more of our children seem to have pectus excavatum, but we would not hesitate to go to Dr. Stovroff if they did. We are happy and confident in recommending Dr. Stovroff to anyone in need of the Nuss procedure to correct pectus excavatum! His results in our children have been amazing! I also want to give credit to Northside Hospital and their amazing nursing staff for their excellent care during the recovery process!"

When your child needs to have a surgery and they are young, in this case my son was only 6 months old, you want to feel as confident and comfortable with the surgeon and their team as possible. I can’t say enough for Dr. Strovoff and his group. I called after hours post procedure with a concern and Dr. Strovoff called me back within minutes to address my concerns and assure me all was well. He’s very personable. I highly recommend this team! "

20,Dr. Michael W. Shotwell,Atlanta,Georgia, General Surgeons , Male,23,4.43,2018-03-29T01:36:27.717Z,5,5,5,5,5,"I wrote a review back in December 2015 after having lipo done with Dr. Shotwell. I want to stand corrected on the bad review I gave him. I haven't even spoke with him or his staff since then. Therefore I am not doing this because I've been asked to or because I'm being compensated in anyway. Im writing a new review because my first one was absolutely wrong and jumped the gun too soon. It took my daughter to say, what, you gave him a bad review after he'd done such a good job on you. I guess you don't notice how good of a job he did when you were already big and needed work and then big gets smaller but not as fast as you want. Long story short, looking back and pictures and all the compliments I received, Dr. Shotwell did a good job. His job was so good to the point where months later, people almost didn't recognize me. I never said anything bad about Sundance and I will repeat, she was great and made you feel real comfortable before and after the procedure. I will recommend Dr. Shotwell to anybody who is looking to lose weight and look good because I did both over time. Actually the reason I am writing another review is because I had another baby and plan on going back soon. My apologies for sending the wrong message. Tamika"

Shotwell,Atlanta,Georgia, General Surgeons , Male,23,4.43,2016-03-16T12:08:00.497Z,1,1,1,1,1,"They have a new doctor now, but still it's not recommended to go to American Lipo Center. Please spend your money somewhere else. The special is one big scam. They pretend to work you upper abs and flanks to only get your lower abs in which they may end up having to retouch to your expense of $500, when it was the doctors fault. Roshay the old secretary/nurse have left only to be replace by some yellow-tooth nurse who thinks she knows it all. She sit and talks about Roshay how he did not know what she was doing cause she was a prison nurse. But at the same time she looks as if she's on drugs most of the time and you have to constantly remind her of things. I would better advice another doctor...Please do your research."
22,Dr. Michael W. Shotwell,Atlanta,Georgia, General Surgeons , Male,23,4.43,2016-03-15T20:21:48.371Z,2,3,2,1,2,American Lipo center had a special get u/l and flanks. Dr. Shotwell did not get my flanks he skipped them. Sundance is a pothead and can't get a schedule right to save her life. Do not go to them! Now I have to get some other Dr to fix what he messed up. 
23,Dr. Michael W. Shotwell,Atlanta,Georgia, General Surgeons , Male,23,4.43,2015-12-24T03:54:16.380Z,3,4,4,3,1,"Do not go to American Lipo Centers in Buckhead. I had surgery done in May 2015. It is now December 2015 and my stomach is still big. It looks like I lied when I tell people I had lipo. I was told if my stomach didn't go down, I can come back to get redone. I've been contacting them since September, and Sundance just keeps saying they're going to get back with me. It does not even look like I came close to having any work done. If you want to see pictures seven months later, email me at Tamika.burnette@yahoo.com and I will show you my stomach. I am now about to hire a personal trainer, which I should've did at first but I was being lazy. And even the personal trainer is telling me to call American Lipo Center back and see what they're going to do first, since I paid for it, because my stomach needs a lot of work. So either those reviews are not real, or I was just the unlucky one who it did not work out for. I would not recommend them, especially for folks who are using hard earned money just to look good. If you have money to blow, I still wouldn't go to them. And you get no response once you tell them you're dissatisfied. "
24,Dr. Michael W. Shotwell,Atlanta,Georgia, General Surgeons , Male,23,4.43,2015-10-05T04:01:11.616Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Had my procedure done on September 30. I had my upper, lower adomen & flanks done. Though I'm still swollen, I am very pleased with what I see so far. Dr. Shotwell did an amazing job, he removed about 4 liters of fat. He made sure i was comfortable throughout the entire procedure. Sundance is an angel, (I love this woman)she answered all my questions & then some, she made me feel very comfortable before & after the procedure. I would recommend them to anybody & if I had to do it again I definitely will be calling them😍😍😍"
25,Dr. Michael W. Shotwell,Atlanta,Georgia, General Surgeons , Male,23,4.43,2015-06-13T01:31:30.313Z,5,5,5,5,5,"I had my surgery today. I feel so good. It was nothing like I expected. It did not hurt at all. It felt like a massage. Honest to God. Dr. Shotwell was the bomb. Sundance, the nurse, super. Everything she says is the truth. Do not listen to the nEgAtive reviews. They're not true. I'm a real critic and would go hard if deemed necessary. The Atlanta office is the truth, A-1. They are worldwide and have a corporate office. I believed that's where you get all the clients complaining from. Although I have to say they were not rude to me. They were actually nice, considerate and professional. I will be posting a few more reviews in six weeks. Three months and six months to discuss my results. Although I hAvs minor results now. Not to mention, the price is the bomb for this procedure. So if you're considering lipo, get it now while there's a special going. Stay tuned for my before and after pics and results. Mek baby!"
26,Dr. Michael W. Shotwell,Atlanta,Georgia, General Surgeons , Male,23,4.43,2015-04-26T07:19:23.908Z,5,5,5,5,5,"I just went for my procedure less than a week ago & I already see minor results. The draining was very minimal(1-2days). Dr. Shotwell constantly asked me was I ok during the procdure & increased more numbing meds as needed. Roshay (nurse) was absolutely wonderful! She is very personable & ensured that I was comfortable. Im excited to see my continuous progression day by day. Minimal pain & scarring. If you are visiting American Lipo Center you need to rethink because the scheduler KARA is TERRIBLE, very rude & if u express that concern to her she will block you from scheduling in the future & blame it on the doctor. If you get smart lipo please make sure Nurse Roshay & Dr. Shotwell as your team, they are irreplacable!! "

They are so Rude if it was not for the doctor and nurse I would never recommend this Business. There is some work that needs to be done with office staff. No follow ups and there scheduling is so limited and everything is to work around there time. I would for sure recommend Roshea & Dr. Shotwell but if I had to deal with the Staff up top I would not recommend this Bus

He is direct in his explanations and has the expertise to diagnose and execute quickly and with precision. He fixed a problem surgically that baffled several other excellent surgeons. He is kind and patient and helped explain what and why he was going to conduct certain procedures. He gets that job done quickly and thoroughly and will work with other Emory doctors when necessary. He is flexible in scheduling surgeries as well. I would send my loved ones to Dr. Sarmiento. The teams at the Emory Clinic and Emory University hospital were superb. I had such good treatment before and after my surgery from the surgeons, residents, pain management teams and nurses. Emory is world class."

My husband was transfered to Emory after routine gall bladder surg. went WAY wrong at another hospital. He was not expected to live. He was 35. Dr. S studied everything about the case. Did a great job on reconstructive surg. However, 2 years later my husband lost 1/2 of his liver due to the damage. Dr. S. did that surg. as well. Dr. S. has followed him for 4 years now.

He doesn/'t listen to the patient and discounts everything said. Dr. Sarmiento has tunnel vision and only sees things in black and white. If I ask about a particular problem and what ask what I think may be the cause, I am immediately told NO as if I do not know my own body. It is far more important to have a Physician with the technical ability and skill, but bedside manner goes a long way! Hopefully he will learn this one day."

I arrived 45 min early to the office and there were two patients in front of me completed the 10 page information packet and waited to be called . My apt was at 1:45 the nurse called me back at 2:15 . While I was in the exam room I could hear the docor with prior patient laughing and speaking of world events and the countries deficit . I could not believe there was no consideration of my time or need at this point I waited until 2:45 and left the exam room I informed the nurse that I have been here since 1:00 and I could not wait any longer . No one apologized nor asked if I wanted to reschedule . I was very disappointed with a lot of time wasted I could see if there were several patients waiting to be seen this was not the case . Being in Atlanta traffic is really bad after spending an hour to get there waiting for an hour and forty five minutes I spent two hours to get back home . In the future I will go with my first mind and carefully consider comments in reviews . I cannot recommend this doctor because he was not mindful of the patients time or need."

I had a diverticulitis bleed a few years back and had one of my nurses at Northside call Dr. Cumming. He came right up to my room to check on me. I love this Dr. and his staff. I find so much comfort and have been blessed to be under his care. I love his sense of humor, his straight forwardness, which means when needed he does not sugar coat anything but tells you the truth.

I could have never asked for a better Doctor at that time. Then in 2011 I had a hernia in my chest, I call Dr Cummings again and once again I was on my favorite table with DR Cummings peering into my insides to make sure there was nothing out of the ordinary. He repaired my hernia closed me up and sent me home. Then came the horror show. I had twisted my bowels around my intestine where what ever I ate would not go down . The horror show was with GWINETTE Med Center. I layed in their waiting room from 7 PM to 1:30 before I was even seen. They ER doctor ran some test, MRI and CT scan. At about 3:30 the ER Dr came to me with good, the good news was I twisted my bowels. The bad news was they did not have a DR to perform the surgery, not to mention they had no bed for me. I told them to call Dr CR Cummings, which they did. He told them to put me in an ambulance and take me immediately to Northside Hospital in Atlanta. When I arrived there Dr Cummings was standing at the ER doors waiting for me. At about 7 am he called my wife to tell her I was there with him, which Gwinette Hospital had no idea where I was, told my wife I was never there. By 11:00 am the same day my wife was there to see me, I was out of surgery feeling much better and Dr Cummings came in a little after she arrived. I say this. God created Drs here on earth to take care of people like me and all who have been blessed to see him. He is kind and patient and very knowledgeable. If he seems short, you have to remember he has other patients, maybe a emergency surgery. He treated me very well and I praise God for him, because if it weren't for him I might have been dead by now. Thank you Dr Richard Cummings for all you do. May God Bless you.

He never recommended an MRI all those years then when I went in with a suspicious lump in 2011 it was dismissed. I went back a few months later due to the pain and found out I had breast cancer. He said ""he should pat himself on back for finding it early...that I would not lose a breast or anything like that."" He did not immediately send me to an oncologist...instead thinking this was a nothing agreed to a lumpectomy. Turns out I had and have triple neg breast cancer. .....was a stage IB ...since I have had to remove both breasts due to recurrence...now fighting due to spread to skin. I should have had chemotherapy prior to surgery due to type of cancer. I will never trust another Dr. I am fighting for my life now. I am writing this so no one else has to go thru what I have. "

His lack of concern is evident in that he did NOT provide timely help or information to assist in my recovery. It was necessary for me (in the thralls of pain) to do my own research. In the end, I endured extreme pain for a longer period of time than was necessary...and had to endure a second surgery (with a new surgeon thank God)because dr.CHOATE failed to prescribe something as simple as a $2.49 bottle of citrate of magnesia when I described my condition to him personally. I would not recommend this doctor to my worst enemy."

His bedside manner is among the best I have encountered. He is very patient with me when it comes to understanding my conditions. Dr. Choat and his staff not only made me feel comfortable through my many procedures and office visits, but they also embraced my family. They took the time to learn me and give me very individualized, expert care. During each visit with him, he takes his time to ensure we are all on the same page and no stone is left unturned. He is very knowledgeable. With that being said, if he comes across a question he doesn't know the answer to, he will consult with a colleague....not too arrogant. I chose my current insurance based around him being in the network. I feel totally comfortable putting my life, which he has saved a few times, in his hands."

He actually listens. When you combine that with his skill and knowledge you have a winning combination. I have had everything from emergency surgery to outpatient surgery from him. Two years under his care has made more positive difference than 10 years under a different Dr. (who almost killed me). Also, Piedmont-Fayette hospital is top notch, as are Dr. Choat's staff."

He also has a very caring demeanor and has spent all the time I've requested to help me understand his decisions and my future outlook. His knowledge and expertise has resulted in the healthist results I've had to date. It is clear when talking to him he knows his stuff. I am about to undergo a final surgery with him, and if all goes well I will have a reservable of a colostomy that another doctor told me would be permanent. (If that doesn't happen it will be as a result of the disease and not any fault of his.) Before him I didn't even have a chance. I would recommend him to anyone 100 times over."

Takes his job seriously (as should be when it comes to surgery), warm bed-side manner, genuine compassion backed by years upon years of experience. I have to say, when I was first referred to him, I was nervous being that he was a bit older. However, I now realize that is what you want in a surgeon - someone who has been around and seen mostly everything. He is one of the few doctors that can even provide a healthy knowledge in other areas of medicine as well. Very well-rounded doctor. Staff is wonderful; everyone is helpful and makes you feel comfortable. I had a desmoid tumor removed from my pelvic area which took out most of my muscle mass replacing it with reinforced mesh implants. Nearly 2 yrs later, I am well and expecting again in 3 months! Dr. Abend is very direct in how he talks, so you should expect that in his demeanor. But to me, that is what you need when experiencing a surgery. A+ for Abend and his staff!"

After going for a second opinion on a surgery gone wrong ends up doing nothing. Does not want to do repeat surgery (even though pain doctor said that's only solution) because ""there's a chance for repeat hernia"". (probably does not know how to operate). Tells me to pull down pants to show him where it hurts. Funny, at Spine Center in 5 minutes they diagnosed nerve block. Buck naked stares up and down, asking ""where?"". Says, he may ""chemically 'kill' the nerve"". Does not even bother reviewing my medical records (probably too lazy to read) Says ""there's nothing I can do to help you"". Then fusses that the insurance did not pay his obscene $285 consultation fee. For doing nothing! Who gave this creep a license to practice medicine? Do not risk going there!! I will be in pain forever!!"

82,Dr. Melvin Abend,Atlanta,Georgia, General Surgeons , Male,11,4.52,2007-12-07T18:29:48Z,5,5,5,5,5,"I had my mastectomy done by Dr Abend in 1990. I still see him once a year for my check ups. Because of insurance, I had to stop seeing him for about 5 years. I was so unhappy during that time. I've never had anyone to give me such a feeling of confidence as I fought the disease. He took time early on to council my husband and myself after hours in his office. We knew exactly what to expect when the time came. He is extraordinary, compassionate, and knowledgeable. I would recommend him to anyone!!"

He is very caring, knowledgeable and extremely committed to his patients. During my mastectomy I felt he was along side God in taking care of me. I would recommend Dr. Abend to anyone in need of his expertise. Dr. Abend's office staff has been with him 17 years and above and are friendly and very helpful. They move mountains!"

The results were exactly what Dr Abend had told me to expect and, even knowing where the scar is - I can't find it. If I ever find myself in the unfortunate position of needing surgery again - I can only hope & pray that Dr Abend is still practicing."

I saw him in the early 90's for a breast biopsy and he was able to ease my mind even though he couldn't give me a 100% or even a 50% yes it is benign at the time of the biopsy :(. With his soft voice, his gentle touch, and a few kind words, he was able to put me at ease. Thankfully, all was fine! I did see him a few years later when we thought I needed my Gallbladder removed, but we opted to leave things alone. Last year, when my mother needed surgery, he was the only person I thought to call. He was wonderful and my mother was so thankful he was there! When I had to have a Port a Cath placed for IV therapy, I called on Dr. Ludi. He was fantastic yet again! Not only Dr. Ludi, but his PA Sandra has been amazing. If the time comes I need surgery, Dr. Ludi is the man I will be calling!! There are no words to describe how incredible he is as a surgeon, a physician, and a human being!"

Dr. Organ is courteous, compassionate and extremely knowledgeable. He takes the time to explain what is wrong in a way that I can understand rather than speaking in the highly complex language of medicine. No other physician can compare and I refuse to see any other physician."

He takes time to educate the patient about their condition. He is the only surgeon I will ever trust! Dr.Organ has been with me and my family through thick and thin.

It is assumed that for such a major procedure you will have done your homework. I chose him because he is very skilled. While I may be an exception, I can say I had no pain after the surgery and have healed without issue. In 8 months time I lost 130 pounds since my sleeve gastrectomy. Dr. Macik is always on time when he is not called away for emergency surgery, but if you think about it you would want him to be available for you if you needed emergency surgery. Tiffany and the office staff are the best. They answer the phones and you can communicate via email. It makes life much easier."

Macik and his staff to always be informative, professional and extremely responsive to my questions, follow ups and emergencies. DR.Macik met me on his day off to perform an emergency procedure so I would not be in discomfort over a weekend. I continue to follow up with him and cannot sing his praises enough. Tiffany has always been courteous and responsive to all questions and problems. I have lost a total of 115 lbs. And have kept it off thanks to follow up care. He is an excellent surgeon and very supportive."

My surgery went well and I am pleased with my results. It is now a year later. I do remember being in the hospital two extra days because he did not feel that I was ready to be released. Why I am I mentioning that?? Well based on his customer service, I just knew he would perform the procedure then send me home. When I had an issue at home, he ordered more tests to make sure everything was in order. Would I go to him again, yes. When bedside manner is important, I am more concerned with his expertise and skill set."
107,Dr. John Galloway,Atlanta,Georgia, General Surgeons , Male,6,4.46,2015-07-22T05:41:18.666Z,3,3,4,2,3,"Wish we'd never heard of him. Because of him making our beloved family member have surgery in a horrible hospital and he did not follow up on her care, we lost our much beloved family member to negligence and overdose, then watched as that wonderful soul suffered tremendously through a horrible fate worse than death, because he did not care enough to follow up after surgery and ""be her doctor"", letting unskilled residents, committees, and nurses handle the care and they were incompetent and didn't care. We watched someone we loved dearly suffer tremendously for a very long time, then die needlessly because this doctors and others like him did not care as negligence was committed. They are all liars and thieves of happiness and examples of all this is wrong with the medical system in this world. You know what you did, and I pray and hope you get what you sowed. I don't buy your fake Christian stories for one minute. You contributed to the loss of someone good and decent and pure from this world, and you deserve nothing good for that. If there was true justice in this world, you would rot from your insides out for what you did. I'm glad you have helped some people. Maybe that will make up for the beautiful life you cared so little for. "
108,Dr. John Galloway,Atlanta,Georgia, General Surgeons , Male,6,4.46,2013-03-14T21:13:18Z,5,5,5,5,5,"I could never find enough words to tell you how great Dr. John Galloway is. He was a answer to prayer for me and my family. I had lived in pain for 8 years before I was sent to him and had been, to speak honest, messed up by other doctors. You can only imagin how nervous I was to be seeing another doctor. When he walked in the room it was like a flow of peace came over me. He not only was kind and attentive to me, he treated my husband the same in which I was so greatful for my husband was the one that would not let me give up for he new me the best and new something was terribly wrong. Dr Galloway found my problem and took the necessary steps to improve my quality of life. For this I will be forever greatful. I owe him everything. God used him to give me hope again. I still see him due to follow up with the surgerys I have had and he has never treated me as if I was not just as important as the first time he seen me and I have used him since 2007. Thank God for this man!!"

I was leary b/c I had other botched surgeries and didn't really trust many, but had to get something done. The very first visit, he hugged me!! No doctor has ever hugged me, not even the one that almost killed me with a nicked ureter and 2 liters of urine floating around in my belly. Dr. Galloway controled my pain and made me as comfortable as possible in the hospital and at home.I cannot say enough great about him and wish every doctor could take lessons from him as far as skills and bedside manner. I would reccomend him in a heartbeat!!"
111,Dr. John Galloway,Atlanta,Georgia, General Surgeons , Male,6,4.46,2007-03-22T22:31:03Z,4.7,,4,5,5,"This doctor has hands from God, he repairs messes other doctors make! A wonderful bedside manner, takes time to talk and answer your questions. Tells you what he can do for you, the expected outcome and recovery period.

I had many complications as a result of the original surgery. Dr. Daly handled all of these complications quickly and effectively.

I have had 10 surgeries since then to repair things he messed up. He told me that I was his worst patient because I told the truth about what he had done. The last surgery he did on me he remarked that at least I was skinny even if I did need surgery. I now use a much better Doctor.

He was not careful with me and made matters worse with astoundingly poor treatment after the bad surgery. He is overconfident and does not listen to patients. I have permanently been damaged by him, he is not a surgeon he is a monster."

I had a very complicated problem requiring an even more complicated surgery. None of the other surgeons I tried to get to help me would even talk to me. Dr. Daly knew exactly what was wrong with me and what needed to be done. My insurance didn't want to pay for the surgery but Dr. Daly and his EXCELLANT staff fought for me and got me approved. I think Dr. Daly is the BEST! He is friendly and knowledgable and I would highly recommend him. You do have to wait a long time in waiting room (take a good book) but nobody grumbles....everyone there doesn't mind because he is such a good doctor and worth the wait! Great friendly staff!

(I'm a female in my early 20's and went to see him alone.) He stood there blank faced and told me he had to or I needed to leave. Then he undercut my dire pain by saying on a scale of 1-10, mine was a ""mild 2."" Needless to say, I ran out of there in tears and will NOT be returning. Empathy goes a long way. However, the nurses deserve five stars."

Ambroze,Atlanta,Georgia, General Surgeons , Male,9,3.67,2014-07-29T20:40:33Z,3.3,3,3,3,4,Open colon resection to remove sessile polyp which ended up having a small amount of cancer in it. Dr Ambroze did what I believe was an excellent job on the resection but unfortunately left me with a few small incisional hernias and a fairly serious diastasis recti. His bedside manner was not the greatest during my hospital stay and I only saw him about three times out of 8 days (as far as I can recall).

Ambroze,Atlanta,Georgia, General Surgeons , Male,9,3.67,2011-08-10T02:39:11Z,5,5,5,5,5,I was diagnosed with a genetic form of colorectal cancer; Dr. Ambrose was very helpful and courteous to my general surgeon when he was trying to find someone to refer me to. Dr. Ambroze runs on time and after an exam was very informative and helpful. Would recommend him to anyone who has GI problems. Truely a gem both inside and out.
128,Dr. Wayne L. Ambroze,Atlanta,Georgia, General Surgeons , Male,9,3.67,2010-02-02T08:09:05Z,4.8,5,4,5,5,"Dr. Ambroze is the best! I had went to several other surgeons who didn't have a clue on how to deal with my fistula. One, in fact, attempted to lay it open but failed which caused more issues. I had almost given up when I saw Dr. Ambroze in the yellow pages. I wrote Dr. Ambroze an explained what the other Doctors had said. Dr. Ambroze called me two days later and said he was sure he knew what the issue was but still needed to examine me. I made the appointment and after a brief 5 minute exam, Dr. Ambroze confirmed what he suspected and said it will take 20 minutes to fix this. Afterwards we set a surgery date. 6 weeks after the surgery I was good to go. This rocked on for 1.5 years; wish I had found Dr. Ambroze from the get go. If you have a colon/rectal issue stay away from the minor leaguers and go with the best - Dr. Wayne J. Ambroze."

Before going to Dr. Force I had two previous laprascopic surgeries (with other surgeons) for a recurring problem and was told that I would definitely have to have a thorocomy for this surgery. After talking with Dr. Force, we agreed that he would try it laprascopically first, then switch to the thorocotomy if necessary. He was able to do the surgery laprascopically when any other surgeon I had talked to wouldn't even attempt it which has minimized my post-operative pain and healing time. He also spent a very long time talking with me and answering numerous questions both before and after surgery. He is extremely knowledgeable, honest about what to expect, and skilled. I've been to well over 50 doctors for various health problems throughout my life (I'm only in my mid-20's), and Dr. Force easily wins out as my favourite. I trust him implicitly and am exceptionally grateful to have found him!"

Force,Atlanta,Georgia, General Surgeons , Male,5,4.05,2009-03-04T20:55:52Z,1.3,1,2,1,1,"Dr. Force performed a mediastinectomy and a VATs (video assisted thoracoscpy) procedure and elected to convert to a full, open thoracotomy to remove a nodule in my right lung that had been misdiagnosed as a cancerous. He converted one of the incisions to an open thoracotomy, five inches in length, which has left me with chronic, neuropathic pain. I was misdiagnosed with cancer, and he performed needless surgery even though immediate pathology results provided during the surgery ruled out malignancy. Patients beware."

She made me no longer feel sad or scared, as I had felt from doctors before her and with the terror of not knowing what exactly I had. Her wonderful attitude and skill made me feel comfortable. After the surgery I had no visible scar. Amazing Doctor! The way I found her: my mother and I asked some doctors (obgyn doctors, even the one who delivered me), they advised Dr. Ammerson b/c their wives, sisters, mothers, or daughters had phenomenal experiences with her. Who better to go to than who your doctor's go to? She is the best. If you have any breast issues, go to her."

Please be aware of this doctor. He is ruthless and only cares about making money. He told me to trust him and the best thing to do was to take my gallbladder out. Big mistake. He told me I just needed to keep one week of low fat diet. Second week eat a normal diet. 2 weeks to recover and then you can go back to normal. BS not having a gallbladder will alter your digestive system for several months. Everything you eat makes you cramp and run to the bathroom. The pain is so intense that you will lose your appetite causing you to loose ton of weight. But he will never mention any of this because he only cares about his pocket. Please stay away from this doctor. He doesn’t care about you Or your well being. I am going through so much because of him. "

He performed my complete thyroidectomy Dec 2014 and you can't even tell I had surgery. He strategically placed the incision so that it blends with a natural crease in my neck.

Dr. Mims was very patient and thorough. On the day of surgery his staff was very friendly and my hernia surgery started on time. Dr. Mims used stitches vs. staples that I have heard are not as comfortable. The surgery was a success and have had no problems. I have no reservations in saying I would HIGHLY recommend Dr. Mims.

I did a lot of research on doctors, techniques, etc. beforehand and was first and foremost looking for a top technical surgeon (I had even considered travelling out of town to a specialty center, but ultimately decided it didn't make sense). I found Dr. Mims to have an excellent manner, took plenty of time explaining things to me and letting me ask questions, and was very courteous and respectful. While I wouldn't call having surgery of any kind pleasant, the whole process was much smoother than I imagined, and I was quite satisfied with the outcome. I was also impressed with Piedmont's efficiency, and would definitely recommend Dr. Mims as a general surgeon."

His nurse is so sweet and smiles nonstop, she's wonderful. Dr. Mims did outpatient surgery on me 3 years ago and I was treated wonderfully from first office visit forward. I was very satisfied and grateful with the whole experience. Dr. Mims was voted one of Atlanta's top surgeons and I believe it. I feel I'm in the best hands with him both as a surgeon and a nice person. I saw him again yesterday for a new problem (that turned out to be very minor), and I had the same extremely professional and caring experience."

I know that people have different results and circumstances but I AM SO HAPPY and my problem is fixed and I would recommend him to any of my friends and family. As far as the billing, of course, being a Doctor is very costly, insurance etc.... I am sure he is doing this for the love of people and not for the MONEY....Thank you Dr. Binderow...

Dr Simpson has no knowledge of wound care And she is inhumane in she neither herself helped me nor wd she allow me to get wound care done by other Dr. She exploited my innocence while I trusted her.

The worst doctors staff I have ever encountered. It took two days for a call back. Staff answers questions without even knowing what they are saying. They need to be retrained or the office needs to start over with a new staff. This office is dealing with Breast Cancer not hang nails. Dealing with the staff makes you not want to go there. I wonder how many potential patients went elsewhere because of the staff. PLEASE DO SOMETHING WITH YOUR STAFF!"

I had a 7am appointment to an office that was difficult to find in a dark empty parking lot with every door locked. After numerous trips behind the building and back to the front and banging on the door, a staff member finally let me in with no apology or greeting. Staff was very robotic. I went through the process of multiple check points and finally met with Dr. Steinhaus. I have a very small papilloma that is benign but needs to be assessed. She spent about 30 minutes with me and led me to believe surgery was my best bet. I left with every intention of having this done but never heard from a scheduler. She told me I could change my mind and monitor it every 6 months. Since no one called me, I did change my mind and planned on going back in 6 months for another exam to see if there was any change. Then out of the blue, I received a very ugly letter stating I no longer was a patient for not following her care and my file was terminated. The letter also told me I will probably die and it is not her fault. Well...that got my attention and I researched this Steinhaus a bit more and she was sued for malpractice which you can easily read about googling her name. What a sham of a place. It's not nice to make an already scary situation worse with a bully doctor. I wouldn't send my worst enemy here."

I had been forewarned that the wait time would be 4 hours. I would understand if each patient was given the time and thorough treatment they deserved. However, the treatment by the staff was disrespectful and unfriendly. I was not expecting that. We are herded in like cattle in a large waiting room. They yelled out my name in the crowd and I had no clue who was speaking to me or from where they were calling my name. I had an appointment with Dr. Steinhauz for a second opinion relavent to suspicious mammogram, ultrasound and MRI. Understandably I was nervous. I needed direction as to next steps and how to go about implementing her directives. Nothing definitive was given to me upon leaving her office. After leaving several messages for Jaimie her assistant, I received no return calls or follow up. I was unable to access the patient portal and called to speak with their office technician two weeks later. She told me no report had been submitted by Dr. Steinhauz as of yet. I had no indication how to proceed. A week later I received a disturbing letter from her office stating I would no longer be her patient for not following through with her directives. Really? I still was not given specifics about what to do. I asked to speak to Dr. Steinhauz and if she would call me when she was available. I was told to leave a message with her assistant. I left several more messages for Jaimie to return my call for clarification. She never returned a call. This was a very demoralizing and anxiety producing experience and most unethical treatment of a patient with the lowest standard of care. Very upsetting to say the least. I am at a loss for how this office could possibly think their conduct was acceptable."

SHE WILL ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS!! Due to this, her practice runs very full and there is a 'process' that is used to inch you through each step of your visit. However, they have a new facility that has been designed specifically to accommodate this process and the delays are not extreme. When you consider the balls that are juggled in this specialty practice - 'regular' visits, ultrasounds, biopsies, MRI's, surgeries, delivering the 'bad news' of cancer, ETC! the finesse of the operation is amazing. And last, but certainly not least in ANY WAY, the entire staff if top-notch, NOT JADED, personable to a one, and a pleasure to work with. I consider this a benchmark operation!"

If I ever need surgery again, he would be my first choice. You cannot get a better doctor anywhere."

After surgery, I was put into a coma for nearly 4 weeks. During that time Dr. Danner kept my wife and family fully notified of any changes in my condition and fully explained what did and did not need to be done. Dr. Danner or staff members have kept track of my recovery by email, text and phone calls. Dr. Danner is doing God's work."

I was very skeptical at first but, 3 weeks later I am very pleased with the results except for a little redness my face looks clearer and more refreshed small lines and wrinkles that I have been trying to erase with expensive creams for years are gone plus a few other impurities I didn't even realize I had until now. I could have had this peel 3 times over for as much as I spent on the creams. He is friendly and very relaxing. I recommend Dr Whiteman very highly his staff is friendly and helpful... Definitely a positive experience. Kathy S."

223,Dr. Carrie Stallings,Atlanta,Georgia, General Surgeons , Female,1,5,2010-12-04T09:04:58Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Stallings is very detailed, knowledgeable, direct, and compassionate. She works at Breast Care Specialists in Atlanta. When a tech thought she saw a lump, Dr. Stallings immediately recommended a biopsy, and when the tests confirmed cancer, she called me at 7PM so I wouldn't have to wait over the weekend for the information. She spent a significant amount of time on the phone answering every question we have. Incredible. We could not recommend Dr. Stallings or Breast Care Specialists more highly. They are the difference in stage 1 vs. more advanced discovery of cancer because the lump did not show up on a mammogram."

He was recommended to me by a former classmate and friend who works with him in the operating room, and I was not disappointed by the recommendation! He is warm, caring, and spends adequate time with you in the office, making sure you understand everything and that all your questions are answered. I had a good surgical experience (as good as surgery can be) and my recovery went great. As a healthcare professional (I work in anesthesia), I come into contact with a lot of surgeons and have a high standard of judgement as a result. I believe Dr. Kuzniak is a great surgeon and I would highly recommend him!"

Dr Ahmann met with my husband and me and explained my options and everything that would be happening. Also in attendance were my medical and radiation oncologists. Everything went as scheduled. I liked her calm, steady nature......it was very reassuring. I really liked having a female breast surgeon."
231,Dr. Kenneth Cardona,Atlanta,Georgia, General Surgeons , Male,1,5,2017-08-11T04:33:47.318Z,5,5,5,5,5, I have met with many doctors in my life. And I don't usually write reviews. But I felt compelled to for this one. Dr Cardona is unusual compared to many other doctors. From the beginning he lets you know that he does actually care for you individually. And then he shows it by his demeanor and his level of care throughout a difficult process. He cuts to the point while not cutting out concern. I wish every doctor I have ever met has his level of brilliance and care at the same time 
232,Dr. Latara V. Demps,Atlanta,Georgia, General Surgeons , Female,2,3.75,2013-10-07T18:01:32Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Excellent doctor, knowledgable, kind, good bedside manner"

Mcgill,Atlanta,Georgia, General Surgeons , Male,4,3.06,2013-07-04T16:40:04Z,1.3,1,2,1,1,"He's kind in the beginning and very helpful but after the surgery, he gave NO face to face information regarding how to care for the wound and how to get my pain under control. He was EXTREMELY dismissive and condescending and not helpful. I endured EXTREME pain and when I called the office he was not helpful and acted very annoyed with my questions. I don't like to go to drs and I'm not the type to 'bother' a doctor. But I am EXTREMELY remorseful that I chose this surgeon and I wouldn't recommend him to anyone. If you're considering this surgeon, please continue your search and get recommendations. I am sorry that I didn't look him up before he performed surgery on me. It's your body entrust it with someone you feel comfortable with or that's come highly recommended."
235,Dr. Kevin M. Mcgill,Atlanta,Georgia, General Surgeons , Male,4,3.06,2012-05-20T22:05:36Z,5,5,5,5,5,Dr. McGill was the best general surgeon. He explained everything very well.

237,Dr. Kevin M. Mcgill,Atlanta,Georgia, General Surgeons , Male,4,3.06,2011-03-24T07:40:22Z,1,1,1,1,1,"Caution to anyone using McGill. He assisted with my surgery. My doctor left the practice. Office staff is incompetent. My insurance changed so I became a cash patient. They would not give me cash rate, then gave me a guess at $1700/fill. I questioned that being way more than double my doctor's price, someone else sent me information that they would take a cash payment for $400 more than previous rate - or $700+ if not paid that day. I had asked for my appointment to be moved and on the day of the fill, I called and they said that they had never changed my appointment because I didn't follow-up again after my call and agree to pay that amount. They said they I could still come at the appointment time but they needed my money first. McGill said he had 5 people before he would see me and I would just have to wait. When I told him I felt like I was being held hostage by him and his staff and asked for a referral to another practice that could give me long-term care, he hung up on me."
238,Dr. Scott D. Miller,Atlanta,Georgia, General Surgeons , Male,1,4.75,2008-02-15T12:29:39Z,4.8,5,4,5,5,"Dr. Miller was a most competent surgeon for my recent prostatectomy. He is very skilled using the latest robotic (DaVinci) technique. Dr. Miller spend a lot of time with me answering questions and making sure I was ready for my surgery. Surgery was in June 2007. It took about 4 hours and I spent the night in the hospital. I had a catheder for a week. I must say that I am a poster child for this procedure. From the day I had the catheder out I have had no problems with incontintence. I also have had no problems with impotence. The sexual experience will be different, but my wife and I have found it to be completely acceptable. I am 59 years old and in otherwise good health. Bottom line here, is that I would highly recommend Dr. Miller."

There has never been a time I have needed Dr. Payne that he has not been there. I recall one time I had an infection from an IV that had been in at the hospital. While my MD who admitted me for another problem felt I was fine to go home, Dr. Payne came to see me prior to discharge, made sure I was on the proper antibiotic and called me each day over the weekend to check on my progress. When he felt things were not going in the right direction, he met me at the hospital (as opposed to having the ER Doc see me) and admitted me. He did not leave me until he knew I was finished in radiology having a central line placed, settled in a room and started on a stronger antibiotic as well as pain medication. He went as far as calling me at the hospital later that evening to ensure I was comfortable. Dr. Payne is always there for you, with a smile on his face and a kind word. He has operated on my hand a couple of times and has done an amazing job!"
244,Dr. Deborah A. Martin,Atlanta,Georgia, General Surgeons , Female,2,3.25,2009-03-04T19:27:50Z,4.5,5,3,5,5,"I was very pleased with Dr. Martin, before my surgery, while I was in the hospital, and afterwards during follow-up visits. She did an excellent job on my surgery, got a second opinion on her own on the best approach to my complex surgery, and fought the insurance company who tried to deny some of my claim. I would recommend her to anyone I know and any family member."

He nurse stated when asked why I had not received any written notice of his move "" we did not think it necessary to notify our patients of the move"". When then asked why did you not tell me when I called for the appointment she replied "" I guess I forgot"". Well ok but when you called me to confirm the appointment why did you not tell me she replied ""I guess we forgot"". Sr Skandalkis performed a hernia surgery in March of this year. I have been experiencing pain in my left groin since September. My physician in November stated I needed to see Dr Skandalkis as he felt the pain was associated with the surgery. After speaking with Debbie today and then the doctor himself it was evident that neither of them had any concern for my welfare."

John found my name in his system. He confirmed my identity by asking me my birthday. He said he can give me a free consultation but I will not be given a prescription because it's free. Now I saw they billed my insurance company for $113.48. Because I have not met my deductibles for 2011, I have to pay the amount. John denied he knew I had the Lasik in the clinic and said if he had known I had the Lasik previously, he will not tell me that the consultation was going to be free.John disconnected the phone line when I told him I remember he told me he saw my name in his system. Dr. Woodhams is a nice person. I never expect his staff to be dishonest, rude and unprofessional."

I wore contacts/glasses for the most of my life and didn't like them, thus I decided to get the surgery, and I'm thrilled that I did! I am now seeing approximately 20/15 (I haven't been in for a checkup in 6 years). Dr. Woodhams and staff told me what to expect before, during, and after the surgery, and they were exactly right on everything. The whole procedure seemed to take only 15 minutes, and was completely painless, I would highly recommend Dr. Woodhams to anyone who is thinking about getting eye surgery. The only drawback is that he won't operate on anyone outside of his specified parameters on what he deems to be safe, so I suppose that isn't really a drawback."

In severe pain, I called to see if I needed to come back in or if my pain meds could be refilled. 2 days later I got a call back. This was NOT on a weekend either. Staff & phone rating (at Dekalb Hospital) = 0 On the other hand, Dr Pelta was knowledgeable, thoroughly explained the options and procedures, and gave good after surgery direction to my family.

Dr. Miller has a unique gift of knowledge when it comes to very hard cases. Dr. Miller is a well kept secret at Emory University Hospital. He was recently selected as one of Atlantas Top 100 Doctors. And I totally agree!!!"

Stomach tube caused a blockage he couldnt diagnose for 3 weeks. I dropped from 178lbs to 125. I almost died until we fired him and the next surgeon had me on the operating table 10 hours later. While I was on the hall he had two other cases with abseses. STAY AWAY from this arrogant man.
