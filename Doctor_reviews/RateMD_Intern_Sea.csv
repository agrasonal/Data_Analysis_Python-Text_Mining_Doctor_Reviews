Go see her you will be glad you did!"

3,Dr. Milah B. Frownfelter,Seattle,Washington, Internists / Geriatricians , Female,11,4.57,2014-01-08T17:03:48Z,1.8,2,3,1,1,"Unfortunately I had a very negative experience with Dr. Frownfelter. I had a complex constellation of symptoms, but instead of trying to talk it through with me she jumped to a common and insulting conclusion that it was ""somatization disorder"" (i.e., ""all in my head""). She made the clinical visit worse when she passed on her written assessment to other doctors who then assumed the same and were equally dismissive. As a result, I had to go to a different clinic to get an unbiased viewpoint and receive the correct diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. So in a way, she was right- it was all in my head (Brain)- but psychologists don't help much with the physical symptoms of MS. Her suggestions were at best unhelpful; her manner condescending and cruel. If only she had taken the time to listen carefully or shown some empathy, I would have received treatment sooner, and saved money and time (and psychological distress). I do not recommend this doctor."

Frownfelter,Seattle,Washington, Internists / Geriatricians , Female,11,4.57,2012-11-17T00:08:02Z,4.5,3,5,5,5,"If I could give Dr. Frownfelter 10 stars for knowledge and helpfulness, I would. She is, by far, the best physician I've had. She has a very busy practice, but takes the time needed to listen, ask thoughtful questions and explore treatment options as appropriate. She has never hesitated, though, to act swiftly and decisively to pursue more aggressive treatments and/ or tests for health conditions when required. The only rating that's less than stellar applies to staff, who are difficult to reach at times. Her primary assistant is not nearly as conscientious as she is, which is surprising."

I have been a patient for three years and have zero complaints. The staff is friendly and my wait time has always been minimal. Dr. Frownfelter is very thorough and takes the time to listen while keeping the appointment within a reasonable time. Excellent doctor.
7,Dr. Milah B. Frownfelter,Seattle,Washington, Internists / Geriatricians , Female,11,4.57,2010-08-26T12:15:57Z,5,5,5,5,5,"You have Dr. Frownfelter listed as ""M"" and this doctor is ""F"", female. She is the best doctor in all categories. Her caring and concerned nature make her easy to communicate with. I have multiple ailments and she is very knowledgable in each of them. Her office location has changed and its more difficult for me to get there, however, I'd go to the moon to see her!"

The receptionist in the office has these disgustingly long nails with landscapes painted on them...not good for a dr. office.
9,Dr. Milah B. Frownfelter,Seattle,Washington, Internists / Geriatricians , Female,11,4.57,2009-01-16T13:10:05Z,5,5,5,5,5,"During the 3 office visits I've had with her, Dr. Frownfelter seemed to be very concerned about me and my health. That's not always the case with the medical system as is exists today, at least in a large city like Seattle. Usually you're herded in and out as quickly so the doctor can see as many patients as possible. Dr. Frownfelter spent more time with me in my first session with her (almost an hour and a half) then all the previous doctors I've seen in the past 10 years combined. She even followed up with 2 phone calls to check in on me after my office visit. Her nurse picked up my phone call immediately when I had a question and called me back within 10 minutes with an answer. Unfortunately Dr. Frownfelter doesn't accept children as patients, otherwise I'd switch my son's health care over to her without hesitation. I would highly recommend her without any reservations."
10,Dr. Ralph Rossi,Seattle,Washington, Internists / Geriatricians , Male,7,4.79,2014-06-06T15:17:10Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Rossi and his entire staff, (with a special nod to Debra) are the best people you could hope to have on your team if you are sick. Dr. Rossi literally saved my life and his team treated me like family all through my recovery. Dr. Rossi is extremely knowledgeable and is not one to rush you through an appointment. He and his staff are the best that you could hope for."
11,Dr. Ralph Rossi,Seattle,Washington, Internists / Geriatricians , Male,7,4.79,2013-07-27T11:59:03Z,4.3,5,5,3,4,Very personable and responsive with follow up. Appears a bit glib and quick to form opinion on diagnosis without referring to other specialties.
12,Dr. Ralph Rossi,Seattle,Washington, Internists / Geriatricians , Male,7,4.79,2011-02-24T23:55:24Z,5,5,5,5,5,"I've been a patient of Dr Rossi for 12 years. His kindness, caring and compassion are matched only by the attentiveness of his staff. He keeps his appointments, he follows up and he is truly a kind and caring human being."
13,Dr. Ralph Rossi,Seattle,Washington, Internists / Geriatricians , Male,7,4.79,2010-05-05T23:04:19Z,4.5,5,5,4,4,"Very conversational and good at explaining what's going on. However, he tends to push pills and tests and seems to cast a wary eye to natural medicine, change in diet, chiropractic care and physical therapy."
14,Dr. Ralph Rossi,Seattle,Washington, Internists / Geriatricians , Male,7,4.79,2009-10-02T18:21:44Z,5,5,5,5,5,"WONDERFUL Doctor! Took the time to call me personally at home when I was having difficulty with my medications. Takes the time to talk with you and seems very knowledgable. The staff are fantastic, very friendly and fast. Squeezes me in usually the same day or next if I need to be seen."

He is the epitome of being a fine, caring, considerate Doctor. Always listens and gives right on advice. He has been my families primary care physician forever. Thank You Dr. Gregory John for all the years, good and bad."

He is incredibly thoughtful and thorough; and he treats me as if he cares about ME. Is there anything more to ask?

He will spend whatever time is needed to answer all you questions and concerns. If he is unsure about specific treatments for you illness, he will reccommend a specialist for you to see. I will advise anyone who is looking for a MD that Dr. John is the best."
21,Dr. Gregory John,Seattle,Washington, Internists / Geriatricians , Male,12,4.45,2011-09-07T12:01:31Z,4.8,5,4,5,5,"Dr. John has been my primary care physician for over 20 years. I have found him to be a very knowledgeable and caring physician. He always has time to talk about my concerns and clearly discusses any issues I raise. I am grateful to Dr. John and his staff for the way I am treated and the quality of care they provide. I actually look forward to our ""visits""."

24,Dr. Gregory John,Seattle,Washington, Internists / Geriatricians , Male,12,4.45,2009-10-25T21:14:19Z,4.5,5,5,4,4,"Dr. John is one of the best General Practitioners in Seattle. Realize though that he is not a specialist. So he won't have the same depth of knowledge that a specialist has. I go to him for general care or when I don't know the problem. If I think a condition is related to the heart, then I'll just skip the middle man and make an appointment directly with a cardiologist. I'm fortunate that my insurance allows me to do that."
25,Dr. Gregory John,Seattle,Washington, Internists / Geriatricians , Male,12,4.45,2009-08-20T11:31:17Z,4.8,5,4,5,5,"Dr. John was my doctor for more than 15 years. He takes the time to listen - and is never dismissive, has a wonderful manner, and always helpful. His nurse Gloria is also great. I was treated in his office and also during several hospitalizations. He was there every morning and evening making sure I was getting the care he prescribed. He works well with other specialists both inside and outside the Polyclinic to coordinate care. He is responsive to phone calls and times when you cannot make it in to the office but need some help or a prescription. Anyone would be lucky to have him as their primary care physician. I am only sorry I moved out of state and can not longer see him. I can only hope that I can find a physician as great as Dr. John in my new state, but I am not holding my breath because they are few and far between. Do not hesitate to choose Dr. John and allow time to develop the doctor patient relationship. Takes some time but well worth the investment. Best wishes."

27,Dr. Seth B. Franklin,Seattle,Washington, Internists / Geriatricians , Male,5,5,2019-01-17T03:25:00.807Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr Seth Franklin has been my Doctor for over 10 years. He is fantastic. I retired and moved 200 miles east of the Seattle and Dr Franklin is still my Doctor. He listens, provides exemplary care and guidance and truly cares about his patients. He recently guided me through a knee challenge and very fortunate that he did!"
28,Dr. Seth B. Franklin,Seattle,Washington, Internists / Geriatricians , Male,5,5,2017-08-11T22:18:26.772Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr Franklin is so candid and effective that despite moving 3 hours from Seattle, he is still my Doctor!"
29,Dr. Seth B. Franklin,Seattle,Washington, Internists / Geriatricians , Male,5,5,2009-11-23T11:04:54Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Seth has been my doctor for 15 years, and I think so highly of him that I moved with him when he want to the concierge model. I'd put Seth in the top 5% of family practitioners. He listens well, explains options and treatment, makes sure he understands your whole health situation (physical, mental) and provides well thought-out options. I only see Seth about once or twice a year (annual physical and occasional stuff), but it's like visiting an old friend...that ""old country doctor"" in the heart of the city. My highest recommendation. Not sure if he's taking on new patients."
30,Dr. Seth B. Franklin,Seattle,Washington, Internists / Geriatricians , Male,5,5,2009-03-04T15:04:56Z,5,5,5,5,5,"I, too, was a patient of Dr. Franklin's for nearly 20 years before he moved to a private association and I could not follow him. The reason he gave for moving to the new practice was so that he could spend more time with patients. He understood my health issues so well that it seemed he could diagnose the problem by just looking at me! Dr. Franklin respected my opinions about treatment options, and was always flexible about giving advice by phone when it was impossible for me to make an office visit. I have found another good doctor but it will be difficult to match the outstanding care I received from Dr. Franklin."
31,Dr. Seth B. Franklin,Seattle,Washington, Internists / Geriatricians , Male,5,5,2008-02-20T11:32:10Z,5,5,5,5,5,"I have had certain medical conditions since I became a patient of Seth's 18 years ago. It may seem a bit dramatic to say but, personally, Seth has been my lifesaver in everyway a doctor and person can be. He is an incredible doctor and an exceptional man. You leave his office knowing you have had the best care possible."
32,Dr. Erin D. Ellis,Seattle,Washington, Internists / Geriatricians , Female,4,4.81,2010-12-06T15:44:30Z,5,5,5,5,5,"I went through two young oncologists at SCCA before I found Dr. Ellis, and I will never go back to SCCA! Dr. Ellis is exceptionally thoughtful, listens carefully to patient questions, and thoroughly explains options. Unlike doctors at SCCA, Dr. Ellis actually takes calls and answers questions directly, saving time and eliminating unnecessary office visits. She is extremely responsive, the nurses who work with her are friendly, compassionate, and professional, and Swedish Cancer Institute actually saves the best views for the infusion rooms, not the waiting rooms! Having undergone months of chemo at both SCCA and Swedish, I have to say that Swedish wins hands down, AND offers more clinical trials than SCCA. Dr. Ellis and Swedish Cancer Institute are simply Seattle's best."
33,Dr. Erin D. Ellis,Seattle,Washington, Internists / Geriatricians , Female,4,4.81,2008-05-27T11:07:54Z,5,5,5,5,5,I feel Dr. Ellis always spends time with me and explains things to me in great detail. I never feel rushed and I really like her bedside manor.
34,Dr. Erin D. Ellis,Seattle,Washington, Internists / Geriatricians , Female,4,4.81,2008-05-16T23:11:54Z,5,5,5,5,5,Excellent care of patient and family. Knowledgeable and able to communicate information well. Informs patient of options show they can make an appropriate decision.

36,Dr. Chris Pepin,Seattle,Washington, Internists / Geriatricians , Male,6,4.38,2011-08-22T13:26:53Z,5,5,5,5,5,"I've been a patient off and on for 10 years. Haven't presented him with much challenges, but it's always been a great experience. he seems fast, sharp, responsible. my major complaint is that the office doesn't have email... that turns the simplest communication, like sending lab results or vaccination records back and forth, a pretty major hassle."
37,Dr. Chris Pepin,Seattle,Washington, Internists / Geriatricians , Male,6,4.38,2009-03-19T14:25:48Z,4.5,3,5,5,5,"I've been a patient for over 5 years. I have never had a bad experience, never thought that he was anything but an fantastic doctor, and never felt that he didn't know what he was talking about. He has a great manner, knows when to bring in other doctors, is prompt with his appointments, and has no issues ensuring you get an appointment in a timely manner when there is an urgent need. Highly recommended."
38,Dr. Chris Pepin,Seattle,Washington, Internists / Geriatricians , Male,6,4.38,2009-03-03T10:07:51Z,4.3,3,5,4,5,"Everytime I've been to Dr. Pepin, I've found him extremely helpful, and has diagnosed what is going on. I received a referral from him that I didn't care for, but other than that, I'd highly recommend him!"

Not only she can speak my language to help me understand the difficult terminology better, but also she is a good listener. I have weight problem and she helped me to like myself more and she uses a very supportive way to encourage me to lose weight and stay healthy. I never felt she pushed hard. I highly recommend her."

45,Dr. Constance Wang,Seattle,Washington, Internists / Geriatricians , Female,4,4.75,2007-11-30T14:53:08Z,4.8,4,5,5,5,I saw Dr Wang several times over a 3 yr period. She was attentive and knowledgeable. I had one semi-emergency and she and her office were very accommodating.

All in all, I would say this is a person that I want for me as a doctor and who I trust my ""medical life"" with."

He focuses on preventative care, and always gives me the resources to get help with my weight issues, even though I have been less than good about following his advice. During my last physical he noticed a spot on my skin, and referred me to a dermatologist, it turned out to be benign but I am glad he doesn't gloss over my care and truly works to help me stay healthy. Pleasant and too the point, I am happy with my general practitioner."

Knows little but will always refer you to a specialist. His assistant is rude and unpleasant. He used to provide personal care with a human touch, which to me is the most important thing for a primary care practician. However, lately, this seems to have changed. I am now actively looking for a replacement."

If he is stumped by the condition he is also quick to refer to someone that he feels may be able to make an accurate assesment. He also spends a decent amount of time ensuring that you understand what he is saying and know why he prescribes the treatment that he has.

The front desk staff don’t ever seem to have a clue of what’s going on and all they want to do is put you through to his nurses voice mail. After leaving a message with his extremely incompetent nurse Stephanie you will be lucky to get a call back and If you do get a call back all she wants to do is get you off the phone as quick as possible. I’m not sure if the doctor is over loaded with patients or what but getting in to see him is also very difficult.

Like when I suggested something, or asked him questions about his diagnosis, he almost seemed annoyed, and created a confrontational environment. I brushed this aside because he seemed smart and he was able to help with some small things that came up over that time. My trouble with him came to a head this year when I was experiencing symptoms similar (but not identical) to a neuro-oplthalmalogical problem I had as a child. After asking him to refer me to a specialist, he dismissed me and said it was just migraines -- afterall, he's the doctor and he knows best, right? I found another route to see a specialist after a few months of worsening symptoms and Dr. Efird continually telling me it was migraines, and it's a good thing I did. Had I waited much longer I would have ended up going blind. So I fixed my problem, but it was in spite of, not because of Dr. Efird."

Then the day before my appointment i had to reschedule to 2 weeks later! I was tired of waiting. I asked to see the soonest MD available and that when I met Dr. Jessica Brzana. She impressed me with her friendly, professional, and understanding to my concerns. She didn't rush me, made me feel i'm in good hands. Comparing her and Dr. Stoehr based on my experience. I prefer Dr. Brzana she was better in all aspects of my visit. I wished more doctors would treat patients as she did for me. It shows that she enjoys caring for her patient. Values my time and she even took time to show me the lab area. Often I'm rushed by all my doctors and feel like the 15 min time I have with doctors is not enough. After traveling time plus waiting time, there I do out the door with another traffic time. All to see doctors for a less than 15 mins. With Dr. Bzana I'm more than happy with all the time spent.

I had been bed ridden for 2 months starting with a case of the flu, but it became apparent that something else much more serious was causing me ongoing body aches and fatigue rendering me unable to function or get out of bed for more than 15 or 20 minutes at a time.
Immediately with my first consult Dr Brzana was able to determine the source of my problem, which was a hyperactive parathyroid that had become an adenoma producing too much hormone that controlled the amount of calcium in my body. She wasted no time in verifying her diagnosis with a battery of scans, ultra sounds, and blood tests.
Upon first meeting her I was struck with her compassion and bedside manner. It was obvious Dr Brzana sincerely cares about her patients and their families. I knew that I was in competent, capable hands with a good outcome. Every step of the way Dr Brzana would call me with follow ups on results from blood tests, from the various ultrasounds and scans.
I can't thank her enough for helping me get back on my feet. "

I havent had much luck getting a doctor to really look into my case bc I do seem fairly healthy. Hopefully I am! Dr. Brzana kept an open mind to possible underlying health issues and set me up with some blood work and referred me to a gynecologist as well. She didn't base any conclusions on my symptoms and odds and took a scientific approach to my case. What a doctor should do! Find out what might be wrong! She also gave me her thoughts on the potential.problems it could be, and what we could do to determine what it is, if anything. I've dealt with so many doctors that have determined my health was perfect without really checking anything. And then later find out something was wrong! Its a refreshing change to have such a good doctor. She is also very likeable, very sharp, even for a doctor, and confidence inspiring. Exceptional doctor:-)"

At one point he asked me, ""well, what do you think is wrong with you?"" After 6 months of him disregarding all of my concerns, I began crying at an appointment and asked that they, ""draw blood, take x-rays, do something."" They drew some blood and took a chest x-ray (severe chest pains was one of my symptoms). He reviewed the x-ray with me and said, ""We aren't looking at anything like cancer here."" He called me at 6:00 that night to tell me I was very anemic and should have a CT scan tomorrow to look for ""a blood clot in my lungs."" The next day I was diagnosed at the hospital with stage IV Hodgkin's Lymphoma. He never called or made any attempt to contact me after my diagnosis. Coward.

When I initially saw her after 2 days of severe pain, she did an incomplete exam, told me I could travel the next week although I could barely sit down. She said my pain was real, but I had a lot of anxiety, that I probably had sciatica. I continued to get worse, her concern for my condition was minimal. After 3 weeks of misery, I referred myself to another doctor, got a much needed MRI and the appropriate care.

Also, my wife switched to her after 10+ years with her GP because she was so impressed with Dr. Basilico. She does have a busy practice and new patients might have to wait, but like all offices, politely work with the receptionist to fit you in. She also has referred me to several other specialists, and each time, they have been very knowledgeable. I have also sent several friends to Dr. Basilico, and each time, they all said the same thing... ""She got to the bottom of the issue and she is nice too.""

The annual check-up was a joke: it was impossible to get an simple question answered, as she was out of the door before I was even able to open my mouse. Needless to say, tests results were never discussed. The receptionist at the desk is rude and disorganized, she assumed that I was a new patient when I called for an appointment and after having taken down my information told me the next appt available is in 2 months, when I tried to explain that I need the appointment sooner, it turned out that it didn't even occur to her to ask or check whether I'm a current patient. Then she told me to ""calm down"" and (I guess as a special favor) got me an appointment sooner. As soon as I have time, I will be out looking for another doctor."

I was in a car accident a couple of days ago and was taken to the hospital where I found out I had no broken bones but I have a rib contusion and sprained neck. I have not been able to go to work for a week and was scheduled to see Dr. Hayden for a follow up. My appointment was at 8:45 and I arrived at 8:50. I was shocked when Dr. Hayden’s nurse came up and whispered to the person at the front desk that Dr. Hayden had back-to-back appointments today and because I was late he was cancelling my appointment and I would have to reschedule to next week. I explained to the nurse that I had been in a car accident and she responded that if it was serious than I should go to the emergency room. I was livid. When she left I told the person at the front desk that being 5 minutes late does not justify having your appointment cancelled. She responded, “I agree.”"

He has always treated me with kindness and compassion. I was having a difficult time when my sent left for Afghanistan and he was concerned and helpful. I am fearful of flying and all I do is call his office and he phones in a prescription to help in that regard without insisting I come in. Given my busy schedule I appreciate such efficiency. I have every confidence in his abilities as a physician.

He told me to use OTC meds, which is fine, except when the problem persisted, he just had me change the OTC meds I was using. I personally believe he could have done more than he did, which mostly consisted of asking me questions. Although he did give me a X-Ray, my later visit with a specialty doctor and his surprise that Dr. Moen did not order any laboratory tests as well, only helped to compound my already negative impressions of him. I could have found more helpful information from webmed than I was given by Dr. Moen."

Moen,Seattle,Washington, Internists / Geriatricians , Male,5,3.9,2009-03-04T11:34:11Z,3.8,5,5,2,3,"I saw Dr. John Moen regularly for nearly two years, but decided to change my primary physician because I found his bedside manner to be intimidating and sometimes rude. I knew it was time for a change when I started dreading my interactions with him. Dr. Moen was routinely uninterested in whatever specific symptoms I came into the clinic to address. He would take a quick look at my rash, and then lecture me about drinking less. If my back ached, he would lecture me about smoking. If I wanted to talk about a sinus infection, he would lecture me about exercise and a healthy diet. Such banal, obvious public health messages are accurate and reasonable, but he repeatedly dispenses them with a judgmental tone and a clogged ear. On the positive side, Dr. Moen was always punctual and efficient. If you are a busy person with only the most rare and minor health issues, then he may be an adequate choice. But don't expect him to listen to you much."

The staff is always really helpful, and the other doctors in the practice are nice as well when they are on call.

Our first contact was Alyssa who made a very favorable first impression. When we arrived for our first appointment, medical assistant Martha made us feel welcome and collected our personal information.
We are so delighted with Dr. Christina Ryan. We found her to be knowledgeable and personable. She showed a keen interest, both in us personally and in our health issues. Treatment options were fully explored and referrals made. We look forward to a very satisfying, long-term relationship.

In fact, he so good that I have continued to see him despite him not being on my current insurance plan. I recommend him to anyone I know who has a complex medical problem, even if out of pocket.
If you need a doctor who takes the time to listen to you, actually look at you, do a hands-on exam, he's perfect. If you want to be in and out in 5 minutes, he is not who you want. Unlike most doctors today, he actually takes the time needed to carefully evaluate you. Sometimes the patient in front of you needs more time, so you may wait but he is worth it. Next time, it may be you who needs a few more minutes.
You should know the reviews from 2012 and before citing very long wait times and poor staff response were when he was at Minor and James, which scheduled him just like every other doctor. That didn't work well given his old-fashioned attention. He is now in private practice and leaves enough time between appointments so that he (almost always) stays on schedule. And unlike any doctor I know, he is available for appointments any day, and almost any hour.
If you want someone who practices medicine like it was practiced 100 years ago, but with up-to-date knowledge, see Dr. Hodges."

I've had to have Mae hunted down every time. To his credit, he's seen me more than ANY friend in these six months, NOT because I like giving him 1/5 of my $/time/energy each month.Worst are his FALSE PROMISES.

I live in chronic back pain from a major spinal injury 23yrs ago (worsening over the past 5yrs) He recently did a MRI of my neck, I already had MRIs of my mid & lower back done in the past few years. My MRI of my neck showed C3 & C5 has pushed C4 out of alignment making my natural curve to now be reversed, as well as has pushed my spinal chord out so it's no longer straight (a fall away from paralyzing me) He is now having me see an appropriate specialist. This Dr is never on time, he does give me as much time as I need to discuss & treat (to his ability) all of the problems I'm dealing with. He is very caring, very wonderful.

Not sure if he is on the right track with his theory but I think if he isn't he will run as many tests as neccessary and consult as many other dr's as needed until he gets it figured out. I did have a problem with his staff getting over 1/2 of my personal information wrong but his nurse was very caring and attentive. and both he and his nurse were happy, sympathetic and seemed to have a good sense of humor."

He considers a patient's input, is open to discussion and alternative choices. He once ordered a test that he didn't feel was entirely necessary but one that would give me peace of mind. One that allowed me to sleep at night and one that led to my exercising more regularly and eating better. did I mention that he communicates with the patient and asks questions? What a relief to have someone who will take the time to consider that a patient may hold the key to discovering the cause of illness. Big Thumbs up."

Maybe it's because my former DR was so attentive. But I always feel rushed, I don't get the feeling that she cares about me. My last appointment was so fast I was out the door with a prescription before I could form my questions. Then I get my test results in the mail, boom! Very bad news in black and white along with a referal to a specialist. It was very shocking, maybe Dr's just book themselves so much they don't have time to give someone bad news in person or even over the phone. It is very disheartening. I'm thinking of getting a second opinion and a new DR."

When I visited her with symptoms like hair loss, extreme joint pain, stomach problems, and fatigue that I had been feeling for months she asked me no more than two questions and then suggested antidepressants. I'm obviously not a doctor, but I do know my body and state of mind and told her that I didn't think that was the issue. As soon as I said that she says, ""Well, you probably wouldn't have been a fit for that trial anyway."" Are you kidding me? Since that visit, I tried all sorts of elimination diets and have pinpointed the culprit. When I think about how great I feel now, it enrages me even more that my doctor, whom I had trusted, so clearly prioritized money over her patient's well-being. I'm lucky to have recognized it, and if that happens to others, I hope you can too."

Once upon a time she was very giving of her time, and would really look at every symptom and possibility to try and find a diagnosis. Once she lost some of her best staff and reached a certain age we began to notice her memory and mood issues. After being with her for almost a decade you would think she would remember that I was a stay at home parent and what my major health concerns were two weeks prior when I saw her. She began to get lazy at taking notes, nevermind finding a diagnosis, she simply ships you off to a specialist to deal with that part of your body where your complaint may be. She is not comfortable prescribing many medications and after so many years began to mistrust and question the validity of my complaints. Going as far as to imply it was all in my head and that no lab test showed any data she could use to diagnose something. She switched my husbands daily med to the newest (meaning less information) for no reason other than she probably gets perks to promote and prescribe it as many docs do. He ended up in the hospital ER with a very serious complication due to the new med. When asked how we can better monitor the dosage in the blood to be safer, she said there is o way to know, so just keep taking it. What?! I found a new primary and in the first one hour intro session I was diagnosed with two issues, one of which does not show up in a blood test. When I went home to research these, it was clear as day this new doc was spot on. I just lost it and cried for an hour. For 3 years I went to her pleading for help to figure out what was wrong and for medication to help my symptoms. She not only was not listening to me, she rushed me, and at times after I waited an hour after my scheduled time to be seen. It started to get very concerning because she would prescribe medications with no diagnosis that carry serious side affects. She couldn't remember what health issues we had, she even missed huge lab results that could have changed just how sick I have ended up, like my severe deficiency in some vitamins. All around it started becoming a horrible experience, she treated us like strangers, forgot everything, so each time we saw her we had to use the time we had to re explain our health issues all over again. I was fearful that something awful was going to happen to one of us or another client she has. Once upon a time she was a good doc and I really was impressed by her, I could not reccomend her to anyone and I hope she retires sooner than later so that nobody gets hurt or continues being sick because she is incompetent at this time to help people.

I found Dr. Sharp to be a sloppy doctor who practices assembly-line medicine. He made multiple mistakes in diagnosis and in practice - for example, the incorrect dosage of 3 long term medications. These medications had to be refilled with correct dosages at my insurance company's expense. When comfronted with such mistakes, he took no responsibility and blamed me, his patient. When I terminated my relationship, he had the Polyclinic notify me that I was no longer allowed to be his patient, as if termination was his decision.

I know that he appreciated the care you gave me and how much you helped me when no one could figure out what was going on. Anyway I just wanted you to know how great you are. Susan August"

Dr. Wicher has been extremely helpful in the many issues I have had to contend with and has referred me to other departments (per VA procedure) for specific help. He has always been helpful in receiving palliative care. As with any doctor-patient relationship, the patient must be their own advocate and must bring issues to their doctor's attention, and when I've done that with Dr. Wicher he has never reacted in anything but a professional manner and has changed my meds on several occasions to as to avoid adverse reactions."

He then prescribed an anti-depressant which had previously caused suicidal ideation, apparently without bothering to check my medical records. He appointed himself my Primary Care Physician and canceled my respiratory meds (COPD 1988, Emphysema 1998), and when I complained, he also canceled my critical heart meds Digoxin and Amiodarone. (Angioplasties for Myocardial Infarctions 1996, 97, Atrial Fibrillation 2000 - all at the VA). When other doctors re-prescribed my critical meds and offered to become my Primary Care (emergency admissions, CICU) -John Wicher re-canceled all the meds and reversed my re-assignment to another MD. Ultimately I was forced to obtain medical care at a civilian hospital, despite Catagory A entitlement at the VA. Matter of Record. I no longer have anything to lose."

Constantly prescribes new medications, then doesn't monitor effects. He should just get a job with a pharmaceutical company; that way he won't be bothered with actual sick people."
247,Dr. Christopher L. Bryson,Seattle,Washington, Internists / Geriatricians , Male,1,5,2014-01-18T16:07:43Z,5,5,5,5,5,"I was assigned to Dr Bryson in late 2000 following a lengthy hospital stay for ETOH withdrawal, perforated duodenal ulcers and anemia. Over the following 13 years I met with Dr Bryson at a minimum of twice yearly or for times a year during different situations including a seizure disorder of mysterious origin. Dr Bryson conducted a comprehensive examination of my medical history at the VAMC in 2000. He discovered that I had suffered a medical error during my stay which included an ""artery vs vein"" misplace meant of a PIC and the injection of dye material directly to my brain causing a R Cerebral CVA. Records indicate the CVA cause was not found to be the misplaced PIC FOR 10 days. This was apparently the etiology of my latent seizures. Without Dr Bryson's self-initiated research into my history, this disorder could have continued to plague me throughout my life. Additionally, he continued to have patience with my many attempts at smoking cessation, advocating for me."

She works at the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance and is devoted to her profession. I was included in every decision made about my course of treatment. I was secure in what we decided together being the best for me. She also listens and remembers the small stuff about you and takes it into account. This surprised me the most during post-treatment when my visits were much less and she still remembered conditions I'd had pre-cancer and made sure that my ongoing cancer prevention treatment worked with the rest of my life. She has been diligent in taking the whole body health into account with me especially after all the changes cancer treatment brought to my body. Even my mental health was addressed to insure that I was functioning o.k. on that level as well. I can't say enough good about her. Personality wise.. she understands that her work is serious and important. You feel that when you are with her in a very positive way.

Most doctors want to get you in and out. He will answer any and every question you have. If he can't he will let you know but I've never met a doctor that wasn't just trying to get you in and out in order to get as many patients seen. He's an excellent Endocrynologist.

Unfortunately I did not have the same experience as them. I found Dr. Wolff-Gee to be very arrogant and a poor listener. Although his breadth of knowledge is good, it's not as impressive as he thinks it is. He misdiagnosed me twice. Both of my parents are physicians on the East coast and their recommendation after hearing my frustrations with Dr. Wolff-Gee was to find another doctor. I wish I had listened to them earlier. My new primary doctor at the Polyclinic is wonderful."

Wolff-Gee,Seattle,Washington, Internists / Geriatricians , Male,8,3.47,2010-12-30T21:34:32Z,3.3,5,4,2,2,"I tried to have a phone consultation with Dr. Wolff-Gee regarding a family member of mine. As a Primary Care Provider myself, I understand the constraints of time regarding phone calls from family. I found our discussion to be dissapointing. I am POA including medical decisions/advanced directives for his patient; I had important valuable information to share regarding said patient. I was informed ""our conversation is being transcriibed as we speak and will be part of the permanent medical record"". Perhaps this is another HIPPA counterproductive policy of which I am unaware of; nontheless Dr. W. was curt and unwilling to take a few minutes to listen to the lifestyle situation of said patient. Time taken to listen to a family memeber who is also in health care may have minimized 4 subsequent inpatient admissions over the follow 6 month period."

No one can know everything, but I'm impressed with the breadth and depth of his knowledge. If you want someone to make your decisions for you, his isn't you guy. If you want someone to present you with options, and give you advice, then this guy will make you super happy. He is brisk, and tells it like it is. I like honesty and someone stright forward who will tell me what the outcomes might/should/could be. He makes me take responsiblity for my health, and he will give me the tools to make decisions, but they are my decisions, not his, and my responsibility."

I wish she was a family practice doc so I could go to her first for all my problems! She worked with me for 6 months on my original problem, and then when my knee pain was getting in the way of treatment she went out of her way to get approval to also work on my knee. I never felt rushed, she was happy to answer as many questions as I had. I never felt uncomfortable with her as I do with most medical professionals. She really has your best interests at heart and will work WITH you to make things better. I cannot recommend her highly enough!"

I never feel rushed when I go to see her. Because they are trying to go paperless she and her staff do spend some time looking at the laptop screen but that's to be expected. I want them to enter the information accurately but it does take away from the quality eye contact. Overall I would highly recommend her. Also, her staff is very nice and helpful in person and over the phone."

I have gone to him for about 3 years for a variety of issues from infections to injuries and he has been responsive and helpful each time. If you are one looking for the pill miracle he might not been your flavor of doc.

He yelled at me when I asked questions about the treatments he was suggesting. He totally lost it and seemed mentally unstable. He has anger management issues and should not be allowed to practice. If you read the other online reviews about him you will see this is a pattern with him. Many people experienced the same unprofessional behavior. Swedish Medical Centers need to do something about him very quickly.
318,Dr. Vy Chu,Seattle,Washington, Internists / Geriatricians , Male,2,3.13,2013-12-04T23:18:09Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Chu is amazing! During my initial consultation he spent 90 minutes with me, discussing my health issues in detail. He cares about his patients and takes the time to address your health issues during your office visits. He takes your temperature and blood pressure, and draws your blood, without relying on nursing staff. Dr. Chu emails his patients and encourages patients to email him with follow-up health questions and concerns. I have been a patient of Dr. Chu's for the past three years and he is the best primary care physician I have ever had."
319,Dr. Vy Chu,Seattle,Washington, Internists / Geriatricians , Male,2,3.13,2012-12-07T11:02:11Z,1.3,2,1,1,1,"Unless you are rich, do not go to this office. I went there for an introductory check, thinking I would like him as a primary care doctor. I had an STD screening as part of my introductory check and a Chloesterol screening. Those two, he billed my insurance company over a thousand dollars and I was responsible for just under $600.00 Wow. really? He sure knows how to pilfer the pockets of the middle class. I thought something was wrong so I checked with my insurance provider and as it turned out, everything was 'coded' correctly. So, there you have it, $600 buckaroo's for a simple STD screening and chloesterol count. DO NOT GO. DO NOT GO. DO NOT GO. Wait. Only go if you are rich. I guarantee he will pick your pocket and he doesn't care what his rates are. Would've been nice if he was upfront and said that an STD screening is $738.00. Do you want that on your Mastercard or Visa?"

I'm not certain what changed but when I am seen there now it's feels as if I am not being heard and my medical needs are not being met.

The UW is an arrogant godless place - if you want to keep your parents with you and is what your parrentd have asked for...run very far from the UW and their culture of death. Her nurse Laurel needs another profession.

I was referred to her by my GP because of and ""incidentaloma"" (something peripheral they saw on a CT scan). She was very thorough and helpful. She has taken my needs into account in planning the next steps. When discussing the possibilities, she has been careful. Perhaps a bit too careful for me. I like to be told the facts. In this situation, it's probabilities and she really didn't want (or didn't have) to give me numbers. ""It could be serious"". She never advocated strongly a specific course of action but that's ok as it made me dig in and ask a lot of questions. I'm happy with the course of action so far. But then, if I die, I'll really rate her down..."

Generally he is prompt and polite, with a pleasent and professional manner. That said, I've had some visits where I felt a bit 'brushed off', and went away with a discomforting feeling. This is based on some directly dismmissive responses to concerns raised about my treatment options. This puts me on the defensive, and I prefer a doctor who is on my side 100%. Time is not the issue. It appears that he has his own agenda, regardless of other choices I would like to explore & discuss, and how I feel about it. My spouse reported similar reaction, after seeing the doctor on his first few visits; bluntly quoted -'He's arogant'. Needless to say, we are coping for now, but we are both looking for a new doctor."

Dr. Crowley had diagnosed an intestinal complication I had when many others missed the mark. She listened patiently as I describe what was going on and the tests verified her initial diagnosis. Dr. Crowley is a skilled, nurturing healer with all the latest in medical diagnostic and methods at her disposal. Dr. Crowley is the best physician I have seen. It is difficult to get in to see her. She is that good."

She told me she would ensure that I not be allowed to see Dr Crowley. I complained and after an hour was ""allowed"" to be seen by Dr. Crowley whose bedside manner was shameful. Instead with preceding with the exam, she lectured me on how her medical assistant is only ""protecting"" her. Good to know, but disturbing that there was no one to advocate on my behalf. I was further lectured on issues of a non-medical nature, never received an exam, and left in tears. It took several more weeks for me to get an appointment with a physician not affiliated with Virginia Mason. Dr. Crowley's behavior seriously affected my ability to the medical care I urgently needed. One I was able to be seen by a physician, I was diagnosed with breast cancer. Shame on Dr. Crowley and Virginia Mason for delaying this diagnosis."

This was one of the worst doctors I've ever been to. He doesn't listen or address my specific concerns, he just treats me like a number and tells me what he thinks I should do according to his own desired results, not mine. Instead of helping figure our how to reduce insulin and lesson my meds, his focus was to increse meds. I'd really like help getting healthier, not just managing the symptoms. This docs answers are all pharmilogical. "

Wait time was very long though, on multiple visits. I was disappointed that I was not referred to an endocrinologist when I started showing signs of insulin resistance--instead I received a lecture on diet that was very unhelpful. I shared my concerns with my gynecologist, and she referred me to an endocrinologist, which turned out to be EXACTLY what I needed. I am now being treated in a way that is actually working for me. I will not be going back to Dr. Torrez because I feel she should have known to refer me to a specialist when I had symptoms outside her area of expertise."

She refused to listen to either of us, and her misdiagnosis of me almost cost me my life. She doesn't believe that patients can be knowledgeable about their own health, and in fact was extremely annoyed that I had read journal articles about recent research on my disease. She's patronizing and doesn't respect a patient who says, ""I know my body and something is wrong."" Lastly she doesn't know symptoms of some pretty common issues, and overly relies on tests. If the test results don't show anything, she completely dismisses all symptoms. Her office staff, Alicia, is rude, combative and downright crabby, and will ""jokingly"" threaten to not pass your messages on to the doctor. Absolutely DO NOT recommend."

I was a pt of Dr Carkin's for several yrs. During most of that time, I regarded her as a knowledgable, caring physician. I even defended her against someone that expressed a bad experience with her. Little did I know. Months prior to my leaving her practice, Dr Carkin appeared unstable, exhausted, and depressed. During one appt she told me that as she aged, she 'had nothing to look forward to...' I expressed my concern for her and was shocked when she imagined my expression to be a potential attack. I did nothing to deserve this and left her practice immediately. While I am frightened at the prospect of living with a progressive disease without a doctor, I remain too traumatized to find another. If you decide to give Dr Carkin a try, be careful not to share ANYTHING private with her as this will decrease your vulnerability should she turn on you.

Takahashi,Seattle,Washington, Internists / Geriatricians , Female,1,1,2007-03-11T00:00:00Z,1,,1,1,1,"This Doctor is a Staff [Education] Director at the Seattle V.A. whose unwritten (supervisory) job is to force Vets out of the V.A. Medical system whenever possible, by whatever means possible. In my case she over-rode my current (now ex) V.A. Doctor and totally ignored at least 2 dozen reports from previous doctors to prevent renewal of my ADA transportation re-authorization. She did this without any discussion and without even pretending any examination. With the net result that it is now virtually impossible for me to get reliable transportation to ANY hospital appointment at the Veterans Administration. Or elsewhere."

But as the doctor on call, he REFUSED to provide me with an emergency prescription for birth control pills (even though a doctor that I'd seen that afternoon had written me a prescription). Basically I needed one month prescribed and sent to my pharmacy because my idiotic insurance requires me to use their mail-order pharmacy for on-going prescriptions, and they weren't going to be able to get me my pills on time. Dr. Sauvage would not write this prescription because his values prevented him from doing so. Instead, he interrupted another Doctor's weekend and made me wait while he found someone else to do this. I have no problem with his morals. But I should not have to deal with them, and if they prevent him from doing HIS JOB he shouldn't be left as the doctor on call."

The staff is horrible and acts like they are very mad at you before you have even said anything. very unhelpful and acts like your uninvited there. I was ignored for over twenty minutes. they make you feel unwanted and a burden. health care should never be that bad. I recommend never going to this doctor or that doctors office.
