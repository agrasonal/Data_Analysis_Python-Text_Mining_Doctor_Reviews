1,Dr. Hrayr Karnig Shahinian,Los Angeles,California, General Surgeons , Male,75,4.59,2019-04-03T17:04:05.016Z,2.3,4,2,2,1,He performed a MVD surgery and guaranteed I would no longer have facial spasm. I do have a few twinges now and then. The main problem is the surgery left the right side of my face partially paralyzed with the right eye that will not close and a right side droop. I am disfigured! In constant eye pain and totally hearing impaired in the right ear. When confronted he told me it was due to the prior gamma knife surgery I had. He SHIFTED the BLAME on another surgery. The other surgery had NOTHING to do with the disfigurement of my face! I would definitely NOT recommend him!

We traveled from the east coast to have my wife’s trigeminal neuralgia repaired. We were led to believe that surgery would be at Cedars-Sansa and then st last minute he switched hospitals for unknown reasons. He of course made no garuntees but was confident he could fix her problem even though she had had prior gamma knife surgery and she voiced concern over scar tissue. He fix her problem but cut her facial nerve due to scar tissue and she had a stroke which he missed. And he left a defect athe entrance to the surgery site that we later had to have fixed by a plastic surgeon.

It was just a viral infection and I didn’t need any surgery. He caused me and my family tremendous mental and emotional stress and anguish due to his lack of knowledge. "

Although the surgery was better than opening my skull, along with the meningioma tumor, he removed part of my brain which caused me to lose my short term memory! On September 9, 2016​, the Medical Board of California, Department of Consumer Affairs, revoked the Physician and Surgeon’s Certificate"

He removed an acoustic neuroma and caused permanent paralysis to my face. I will never be able to smile again!!! DO NOT USE HIM!!! I wish I had used a real surgeon!!!

I was most interested in the minimally invasive approach. I assume my results were probably about the same based on location of tumor but was not prepared for the Bells Palsey look, synkinesis and numbness. I returned home after surgery and only Skyped with Shahinian a few times after. Follow up after surgery was poor and Skype after 3 months would have cost S350 per (5 minute) session. I was continually told to wait and I'd be better but still have problems with facial reanimation. And that is with NOT waiting and finding excellent help with facial retraining, as well as surgery Gracillis Muscle Transfer (in Boston) to smile. "

Went for a consult and he told me he could cure every ailment I had including a neurological disorder that is incurable. His staff sent an estimate and it was more than 3Xs that of any other procedure quoted to us. He tried to justify it, but my family and I could see right through him. "

I have seen about 5 different neurosurgeons in different states (most of them from highly reputable hospitals) before I found SBI. Most of them spent barely any time with me during consults (or their PA's saw me instead) only to recommend the old technique, open brain surgery. My first Skype consultation with Dr. Shahinian was the most informative and educational out of the 5 I had with other neurosurgeons. His fully endoscopic surgery made sense to me. Dr. Shahinian removed my acoustic neuroma in 2013 and I am forever thankful for getting a second chance at life. "
10,Dr. Matthew A. Lublin,Los Angeles,California, General Surgeons , Male,26,4.64,2017-06-16T02:36:41.516Z,5,5,5,5,5,"I cannot possibly recommend Dr. Lublin highly enough. He is beyond fabulous. I had a ruptured appendix, and my internist contacted him to do an emergency appendectomy. He came in late on a Friday night, was kind and reassuring, really listened to all my questions and concerns, and did the procedure at about 1:30 in the morning. It wasn't easy (my appendix was in an odd spot - high rather than low, and buried under my entire colon) and most surgeons would have needed to open me up rather than being able to perform the procedure laparoscopically. Dr. Lublin has phenomenal surgical skills, and he's also just a nice kind guy. Down to earth. Patient. And one of the few physicians I've encountered who truly listens to patient questions and input. I am deeply, deeply grateful. Of course I hope not to need surgery again, but if I ever do, he would be my first call. "
11,Dr. Matthew A. Lublin,Los Angeles,California, General Surgeons , Male,26,4.64,2016-07-27T03:27:10.432Z,3.5,4,4,3,3,"Dr. Lublin seemed done and over with his work, so blasé and even a bit sarcastic he was. Mine was a fairly straightforward procedure so I went on with him after the consultation, but I sure felt uncomfortable listening to and talking with him. Two thumbs down."
12,Dr. Matthew A. Lublin,Los Angeles,California, General Surgeons , Male,26,4.64,2015-12-18T17:59:01.798Z,2.8,3,3,3,2,"I recently had hiatal hernia repair surgery with Dr. Lublin. I found him to be a complete jerk. When I woke up from surgery I had severe neck pain. I had told the anesthesiologist the day before that I had a herniated disc in my neck. Whatever they did during surgery inflamed the disc and I was in severe pain when I woke up. When I told this to Dr. Lublin he said it was gas from the surgery. I knew it was not gas; it was my herniated disc. I told him he could confirm this by looking at my records on line or calling my rheumatologist. His answer to me was, ""What do you want me to do about it - call her yourself""!. I was flabbergasted by this response and spent the next 32 hours in horrific pain to the point of tears. This caused me to have to spend an extra night in the hospital when I should have been able to leave the same day. 32 HOURS OF SEVERE PAIN. No one should ever have to endure that. Eventually after 32 hours they sent up a pain doctor who gave me the right drugs (muscle relaxant and nerve medication) and the pain subsided by about 30-40%. Even the nurses on the floor were flummoxed by my lack of care and reported this to the charge nurse. They had NONE of my medications in the chart and were not able to help me. I could not recommend Dr. Lublin to anyone. No one deserves to be treated this poorly. If you are considering surgery I suggest you find another doctor.
It is now 13 days post op. In all this time I have not heard a peep from Dr. Lublin. Not a call to see how I was doing, check on my pain, diet, whatever. Nada. That is until now. Suddenly, at 8:30 tonight out of the blue I received a call from Dr. Lublin to ""see how I was doing."" Why was he really calling I asked knowing that in fact he could care less. Well it turns out he was upset and ""disappointed"" in the review I posted above. He could not seem to grasp that it was cruel and unnecessary to leave a patient in pain for 32 hours! He had no response to this fact at all when I asked him. In his mind he had done a brilliant operation and therefore I should be grateful. I am no more grateful to him for doing what he was paid to do then I am to my car mechanic who fixes my car. I pay him as well and he would never leave me in pain for 32 hours! Instead of calling to apologize for his behavior he was calling to justify it and argue with me! In his mind he did nothing wrong! In what world does a doctor leave a patient in pain for 32 hours and think he did a great job and that it was in any way, shape or form justifiable!! Maybe in Hitlers Germany, but not here and not now. I cannot believe this man is so egotistical and full of himself that he cannot see that what he did was wrong. Well, maybe after he appears before the peer review that will be taking place at St John's he will get it, but I doubt it. Maybe after he is reported to the Medical Board, but I kinda doubt that too. I'm sorry, but if you choose this guy as your doctor after reading this and get the same disrespectful lack of care and treatment that I received, then you have no one to blame but yourself. Forewarned, forearmed. It's your choice."

Lublin,Los Angeles,California, General Surgeons , Male,26,4.64,2014-11-30T21:37:03.964Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr Lublin took my wifes gall bladder out because of gallstones, we met him at my Gp office and he said he would do the sergurey that next week. AT hosipital 5 am, into serguery 7 am homeward bound 11 am. No problems and wife was very happy with the results and so was I."
14,Dr. Matthew A. Lublin,Los Angeles,California, General Surgeons , Male,26,4.64,2013-02-07T18:45:28Z,5,5,5,5,5,Dr. Lublin was very nice and explained things carefully before surgery as well as afterward. I was very confident with his care before and after. He came in late on a Sunday to the ER to talk to me.
15,Dr. Matthew A. Lublin,Los Angeles,California, General Surgeons , Male,26,4.64,2012-06-07T23:33:15Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Lublin repaired an inguinal hernia for me. He assured me I would be able to return to my normal, high level of physical activity with no restrictions. I am very satisfied with the results and recommend Dr Lublin highly. Today, 46 days after the surgery, I was in the gym doing deadlifts. Of course, I am starting light, but still, I did 25 lifts with 140 pounds, and 3 partial lifts with 225 pounds. I do feel some tenderness in the area after doing this so I will wait a week before trying it again. I have walked an hour each day since day 3, as vigorously as possible, and I began stretching gently as soon as it felt ok. There is often some tenderness at various times. I can see and feel myself getting better each day. Very good results, thus far."
16,Dr. Matthew A. Lublin,Los Angeles,California, General Surgeons , Male,26,4.64,2012-06-07T21:59:24Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Lublin has a wonderful sense of humor and a very direct, genuine manner. He explained my procedure clearly and always felt I was in good hands. Unlike many specialists, his office is efficient, on time, and very friendly."
17,Dr. Matthew A. Lublin,Los Angeles,California, General Surgeons , Male,26,4.64,2012-05-20T22:56:10Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Lublin took out 1/2 of my thyroid. He was patient and answered all of my questions, he drew pictures when I didn't understand and he calmed me down because I was very nervous. He did an excellent job and the scare is so small that even now you can hardly see it. I would recommend him to anyone contemplating this surgery. I couldn't be more pleased."
18,Dr. Matthew A. Lublin,Los Angeles,California, General Surgeons , Male,26,4.64,2012-03-14T22:43:08Z,5,5,5,5,5,"My over all experience with Dr. Lublin as a Surgeon was spot on. He catered to my concerns, answered my questions, and was always polite. I felt that Dr. lublin did exactly what he felt was necessary as a doctor and by doing this he had my safety and comfort as his top most priority. I can tell you that I'm completely recovered and I now have a freedom in my life that I haven't been able to experience in a very longtime. Also, I no longer suffer from chronic pain and I'm 100% cure. Dr. Lublin haspermanently changed my life for the better and I thank him so very much for his time and dedication in helping me with my illness. I wish you all the best in your life."
19,Dr. Matthew A. Lublin,Los Angeles,California, General Surgeons , Male,26,4.64,2012-03-02T21:32:50Z,5,5,5,5,5,"I went to Dr. Lublin to have a lypoma removed from my back. He did a great job telling me my various options (general vs. local anesthesia). He was friendly and personable throughout the procedure, even talking with me during it to help me take my mind off the fact that he was cutting / pulling a weird lump of fat out of my back! He even was cool with letting my wife take a picture of the procedure in the middle of it, and letting us take a picture of the thing after he'd taken it out. He scheduled a follow-up visit, and was very prompt in seeing me when I showed up. Now that the bandage is off, I'm amazed at how small the incision he made was to take out such a large lypoma. The lypoma itself was probably about 2-2.5 inches across; the incision was about an inch. It's healed nicely, and I imagine the scar will not be very noticeable, if at all. I highly recommend him! *Note: the amount I paid was after I'd reached my $300 deductible, which I'd have had to pay anyway somewhere else."
20,Dr. Philip Werthman,Los Angeles,California, General Surgeons , Male,11,5,2012-10-15T23:50:20Z,5,5,5,5,5,Fantastic. Great guy. I would recommend him to anyone. Very personable.

22,Dr. Philip Werthman,Los Angeles,California, General Surgeons , Male,11,5,2012-01-19T16:08:02Z,5,5,5,5,5,Dr. Werthman provided what felt like a true miracle. I would recommend him to my dearest friends and family or anyone else that would need his service.
23,Dr. Philip Werthman,Los Angeles,California, General Surgeons , Male,11,5,2011-12-12T13:39:38Z,5,5,5,5,5,Without a doubt this has got to be one of the finest doctors around. He makes you comfortable in uncomfortable situations. Top notch when it comes to explaining the procedure pre and post surgery. Dont look any further. This is the doctor you need to see. I had a vascetomy 13 years ago and within 11 months post surgery we were pregnant and have a beautiful baby boy. All my thanks to Dr. Werthman and his staff
24,Dr. Philip Werthman,Los Angeles,California, General Surgeons , Male,11,5,2011-12-07T14:17:20Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Werthman is, quite simply, everything a doctor should be. He is, of course, highly knowledgeable, a great diagnostician and a phenomenally gifted surgeon. His staff is prompt, courteous, and a delight to work with. However, his positive attributes extend far beyond that. He has a wonderful down-to-earth demeanor and is very easy to talk to. He listens and thinks things through rather than giving rote answers. He patiently answers any and all questions. He sees issues quickly and clearly, and conveys information in an easy to understand manner. He delicately and compassionately handles what is for most people a sensitive subject matter. He is classy in every sense of the word. We are personally eternally grateful to Dr. Werthman for allowing us to realize our dream of having a family. We would absolutely recommend him to everyone."
25,Dr. Philip Werthman,Los Angeles,California, General Surgeons , Male,11,5,2011-11-29T23:19:39Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr.Werthman proved to be a valuable part of our lives, because of him we have a beautiful baby boy. His compassion towards us is true and sincere."

They have litterally pulled off the impossible in my case and my wife and I are forever in his debt. If I knew how quickly we would get pregnant following a 14 year vasectomy, I would have paid double or more! Dr Werthman was amazingly knowledgable and certainly deserves more for the results he produces. I can and probably should go on, but the bottom line, DR WERTHMAN IS THE BEST IN THE BUSINESS!"
27,Dr. Philip Werthman,Los Angeles,California, General Surgeons , Male,11,5,2011-11-22T13:07:54Z,5,5,5,5,5,Dr. Werthman is an amazing Doctor! I would recommend him to anyone!

He reversed my husband's 12 year old vasectomy and we were pregnant within 8 months. I know have 2 handsome boys thanks to him, and my husband of course ; )"
29,Dr. Philip Werthman,Los Angeles,California, General Surgeons , Male,11,5,2010-05-07T10:13:30Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr Werthman is by far the best doctor I have ever seen for any reason. My husband suffers from chronic testicular pain that had remained undiagnosed for 3 years by the army. In less than 5 minutes Dr Werthman gave my husband a diagnosis, and within 3 days my husband was FIXED. We owe everything to this man and I cannot say enough to express my gratitude. Worth every penny. If you have any problems with your male reproductive ""parts"" ;), then go see Dr Werthman. You will not find any better. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!"

He said that this surgery could be an easy job for him and he had already did many operations like this. these words inspired me and I got a strong spirit. Actually he has got a gentle personality.His surgical job on my esophagus was such a professional that I could get recovery in just 3 days after a big surgery. Thanks a lot Dr. Lipham, you saved my life and you did a great job. Now in just a week, there is no any pain. I have got more than 90% of my health back after 13 years.My kids and my wife are very happy and thankful. By the way, the employees and nurse in Dr Lipham's office are great. very organized and helpful.The USC Hospital is a great place for surgery as well. "

Lipham,Los Angeles,California, General Surgeons , Male,15,4.57,2016-07-16T20:02:36.503Z,5,5,5,5,5,I trained with Dr Lipham as a surgeon almost 20 years ago and will always consider him as one of the best doctors I have ever worked with. I have seen him operate and treat hundreds of patients with optimal care and results. I would have no hesitation in consulting with him and being operated by him. As a fellow doctor I hope this helps others make a decision to consult with him.
33,Dr. John C. Lipham,Los Angeles,California, General Surgeons , Male,15,4.57,2014-12-15T16:39:54.227Z,5,5,5,5,5,"I was diagnosed with Early Stage 3 Esophageal Cancer in November 2013. I had several pre-surgical complications including the use of a feeding tube needed after radiation which rendered my esophagus inert. However my March 2014 surgery was a complete success during which Dr. Lipham removed about 15% of my stomach and 70% of my esophagus. Nine months later a PET scan indicated that I am cancer-free. Dr. Lipham has a great staff including other doctors as well as his PA which are always available for questions and updates. If one gets a cancer like mine, one needs to find the very best surgeon available who at the same time cares greatly about any post-surgical complications that would degrade one's quality of life going forward. I give Dr. Lipham the highest recommendation possible!"

He is alive and well today because of Dr Lipham's outstanding skills as a surgeon and physician. My husband was Stage 4 gastro-esophagel cancer. Dr Lipham took 60 percent of his stomach and 100 % of his esophagus and rebuilt an esophagus with the remaining stomach. He did this all laparoscopically.
He is an excellent surgeon with amazing patient care, bedside manner outstanding reputation and concern for his patient and family members. His staff and surgery team were attentive, considerate. efficient and kind. He was the miracle we prayed had for. My husband is now past the three year point in recovery. Thank you, Dr Lipham."

Scheduler is never available and then calls to tell you when your appointments will be, no working with work or family conflict. I waited 2 hours past my appointment time to be seen by Dr Lipham and the staff is not concerned. Go to the other USC surgeons for anything that is not Lipham's specialty. He has limited time at the Keck location, making it even more difficult to see him."
36,Dr. John C. Lipham,Los Angeles,California, General Surgeons , Male,15,4.57,2013-05-01T06:10:20Z,1,1,1,1,1,"I suffered severe problems immediately after eating post reflux surgery. This doctor not only did not acknowledge or advise about the problem, he ignored it, did not treat it and made me suffer for many months. He and one of his nurses were very rude and he refused to order the tests for the problem I was having. Not only that, he did not inform me of a torn diaphragm during surgery even after I had severe breathing problems afterward. I do not recommend this surgeon as he does not fix problems his surgery caused."
37,Dr. John C. Lipham,Los Angeles,California, General Surgeons , Male,15,4.57,2011-11-24T10:45:53Z,5,5,5,5,5,Amazing surgeon! Took out my esophageal cancer with little incisions. Out of the hospital in 6 days. Great bedside manner. Truly cares about his patients. Saved my life!!!

She no longer has any symptoms, and takes no medication for Reflux. She later had Barret's ablation to remove the remaining Barret's disease, from which she returned to normal activit in about three days. Every aspect of her care by Dr. Lipham and his staff at U.S.C. has been excellent. We greatly appreciate the quality of life returned to my wife by Dr. Lipham and his team, and highly recomend him."

Dr. Lipham was very down-to-earth, caring and took the time to answer any questions. I cannot believe, considering the extent of the surgery, how small the incisions are. All done Laparoscopically...absolutely amazing. This doctor is the best and I highly recommend him."

He made me feel so comfortable about the pain I'd been feeling and seemed to know instantly that I needed surgery, and wasn't going to make me wait. He explained everything so specifically and didn't mince words - yet had the warmest and most reassuring bedside manner of any doctor I've experienced. He expedited my hospital admittance last month and the surgery went as smoothly as he'd said it would. I felt fine within days, and can't thank him enough for taking such good care of me. I hope I don't need any surgery again, but if I do - he's the first surgeon I'm calling!"
42,Dr. Hector C. Ramos,Los Angeles,California, General Surgeons , Male,6,5,2011-01-02T00:08:53Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr Ramos removed a huge very rare tumor from my abdomen. His skill with a knife is legendary, my son in law in SLC, 700 miles away knows his reputation and I won't dispute it. His bedside manor is second to none. He answered every one of my questions and I was fully at ease with the procedure even when he told me how hard it would be. He demonstrated a master's knowledge of post op tricks, minimizing my pain and making the 6 week ordeal almost enjoyable. His great sense of humor and quick wit kept my wife and I at ease the whole time. I would recommend Dr. Ramos any day. If I need a surgeon, he is the man I want in my corner."

44,Dr. Hector C. Ramos,Los Angeles,California, General Surgeons , Male,6,5,2010-01-06T14:57:10Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Hector C. Ramos is a super doctor. He made sure my surgery was handled on a rush basis & explained everything, every step of the way. He was caring & made sure my wife was kept informed all during surgery and recovery. He personally reviewed information from other attending doctors so everyone was in synch. His bedside manner was excellent and very refreshing.

Kind,compassionate, giving, brilliant and passionate about saving lives and quality of life, and a staunch ethical backbone. And yet, none of the arrogance and ego that so often accompanies such talent. Just a cheerful smiling face full of optimism. He bucked hospital bureaucracy and peer pressure to give my father a fighting chance, saving his life and giving us hope and that much more time with him. He is the standard bearer. If his qualities could be taught, he should have be tenured at every institution."

Implicit in their action was that they were in network. I received a bill 10 month later for $250. They were very unhelpful (almost to the point of being discourteous). CAUTION before visiting Dr. Adashek, check on your insurance coverage through your company. The staff probably will not give you this information (the day of my visit, the staff told me they had problems contacting my insurance provider). PS: Dr. Kenneth Adashek on the other hand was most professional and helpful."

Yeh,Los Angeles,California, General Surgeons , Male,31,3.57,2018-09-04T03:52:11.080Z,5,5,5,5,5,"I wanted to take the opportunity to write about my and my family’s experience with Dr. Yeh as he has been such a blessing in our lives. In 2014, I was diagnosed with stage 4 thyroid cancer that had spread into my neck and upper chest. Thankfully, I had been referred to Dr. Yeh. From the moment he came in the room to discuss my case with me, I was put at ease. He explained all his recommendations, including the recommendation for surgery. I knew of his extensive surgical training, and, paired with his confidence, I felt very comfortable with him performing my surgery. I underwent surgery and had a lot of cancer removed. During the surgery, Dr. Yeh found that a tumor had grown entirely around my laryngeal nerve. He could either completely cut the nerve, rendering me unable to speak, or he could spend a significant amount of time scraping the tumor off of it. Given the situation, he felt confidant he could effectively removed the disease by scraping it off the nerve, and not cut the laryngeal nerve. I am a pastor, and my passion is to preach God’s word from the pulpit every Sunday. Losing my ability to speak and preach would have been devastating for me. Dr. Yeh spent extra time in surgery to allow me to still be able to preach God’s word, and for that I am incredibly thankful. I knew that if there was no way to save the nerve in order to remove the cancer, he would have cut the nerve. However, he saw a way to save it, and saved it even though it took more time for him to take that approach. My postoperative care was great, and the scar on my neck was unnoticeable since he made the incisions inside the natural wrinkles in my neck. As is often the case with the type of cancer I have and its natural course, I had more disease that grew after the surgery and needed to be removed. Dr. Yeh again went in and did an incredible job, and I still have no visible scars. It has been almost 4 years since my first surgery, and 3 years since my second surgery, and I am doing very well. I am forever grateful for Dr. Yeh being my surgeon. I follow-up with him regularly, and would highly recommend him to anyone who needs an excellent ENT/thyroid surgeon. His bedside manner is great, and he was so kind to explain and answer any questions my family had while I was recovering after surgery. If in the future I require more surgeries to remove more disease, I will undoubtedly go back to Dr. Yeh. His skill and expertise is unmatchable, and I am so blessed to have him as my surgeon."

Yeh,Los Angeles,California, General Surgeons , Male,31,3.57,2018-04-30T23:49:12.357Z,4.5,5,3,5,5,"My heart leads me to write this, after reading some of the negative responses I was drawn to express my families experience with Dr Yeh. 5years ago my husband was diagnosed with a rare tumor. (Paraganglioma) Our local hospital could not and had not dealt with anyone with this type of tumor before. They reached out to Stanford and UCLA to see if either hospital would accept him. We researched the tumors and found Dr Yeh specializes in type of tumors. We felt blessed to hear he was willing to accept my husband as his patient. He ended up removing the tumor which was wrapped around the vena cava with much success. He was so compassionate with my daughter's and myself. He gave us a wealth of knowledge regarding these type of tumors. I had no idea how much we would value this information. My husband recently was being treated for a separate issue but after questioning some of the test results I requested some other tests be done due to some of the information Dr Yeh had given us five years ago. Unfortunately the tests had come back positive and the tumors had metastasized and he now had tumors in his liver. We were able to meet with Dr Yeh over the test results. He informed us that he would meet with the tumor board for a treatment plan for my husband. They decided what would be the best way to treat these tumors. He referred him to the liver specialist at UCLA. Unfortunately our insurance wanted my husband to now go to another hospital. We fought with our insurance company to be able go back to UCLA. ( his staff also got involved in dealing with the insurance company) Dr Yeh ended up talking with the medical director with our insurance company explaining why it was imperative to go to UCLA. ( He was not even going to be my husband's surgeon at this point) The insurance company relented and authorized for my husband to go to UCLA. Everything went well and my husband is nowback at work.
I am sorry to hear other people's experiences didn't go well. We all need to remember these Doctors are human and as much as we all want perfect results sometimes that is not the case. We need to remember they everyone and every situation is different. Like I said we feel very blessed to have Dr Yeh as my husband's Doctor."

Too bad his surgical expertise does not match his marketing ability. All patients, please be careful, do not let this man operate on you. He performed a thyroidectomy on me. While doing so, he cut my laryngeal nerve, resulting in vocal cord paralysis. He also damaged my parathyroids, resulting in lifelong calcium impairment, He left remnant cancer behind. He damaged a shoulder nerve causing lifelong pain. This man is reckless. He was in rush to get me into surgery. Later I learned he embellished his surgical record. Do not, I repeat, do not let this man perform surgery on you."

If I had to describe him in two words, it would be empathetic and knowledgeable. He took into account what I had been experiencing and offered advice/information before making a final decision on what course of action to take. He is very thoughtful and takes into account your particular conditions when coming to a decision - we decided to wait and monitor my thyroid because he said that it was probable that being young and otherwise healthy, the condition would not require surgery"

Everything here at UCLA was oriented in the aspect of ""how can I help you?"" The care we received here was so radically different from where we come from. It was almost shocking to see medical professionals who were primarily concerned about my well-being. Everybody in the UCLA health system was kind, patient, and considerate, and Dr. Yeh as a person was exceptionally personable. He's knowledgeable about many things and is one of the pioneering doctors on minimally invasive surgery. He explains clearly in terms that you can understand and never gives you the impression that he's in too much of a rush to answer your questions. Before our first visit, Dr. Yeh took the time to personally call us and explain what the minimally invasive approach was. You never doubted your importance when speaking with him and he devotes his entire attention to you. My scar is invisible after the surgery, and my wife's scar is barely visible. Overall, we're very happy with our experience. He is someone who impressed us greatly with his genuine care for our lives and well being - he listens attentively and addresses our concerns."

It truly is the best decision we've ever made.. My wife had severe pain from adenomyosis and endometriosis and I don't know how much longer she could've gone on..seriously. Dr Del Junco fixed everything with the surgery. She truly has her life back, has all of her female organs and isn't on any medication or hormones. Truly a miracle which is why I'm writing this.. how often do you hear about complications from hysterectomy? So, so common.. hormone issues, need ovaries taken out, lingering pain.. I hope people can read this and at least give Dr Del Junco a chance. He spent something like two hours with us on the initial consult. What doctor does that these days?? Hard to get two minutes let alone two hours. Read his website thoroughly and hear what he has to say; so glad that we did..hope you do too!"

He was extremely rude, egotistical and inappropriate. He told me not to ask questions and ""be more like a patient"". He said I would have problems after surgery simply because I was medical professional. He was always negative and rude when speaking with me. He didn't appear until 2 days after surgery, though I was having severe reactions to medications and in great pain. When he arrived, he didn't ask how I was feeling, instead he was exclaiming pride in how many tumors he'd removed. He did not do ultrasound prior to surgery, as other surgeons would have. If he had told me there were so many tumors, I never would have done his procedure. You can't cut 100's of tumors from a uterus, put it back in, and expect it to function normally. That is just practicing bad medicine. He is knowledgeable, yes. He may even be skilled. But his ego gets in the way of sensitivity and good communication. I would never recommend him as a doctor."

He so strongly believes in the preservation of female organs, which helped make my decision for me. He's not only very skilled, knowledgeable &informative but is also very compassionate! He and Patricia gave me as much time as I needed during the initial consultation, pre surgery & my follow up visit post surgery to ask questions.Everything was fully explained with no surprises! In fact, he knew my condition so well that I was amazed and enlightened.The care and concern extend beyond the post-op as it's been 1 1/2 yrs since my surgery and the communication continues.I live in Arizona and had researched doctors all over the world and I clearly know I found the best of the best in the the field.

Temple Hospital is a TERRIBLY old and antiquated hosptial, I hated staying there. After my surgery for endometriosis while in the hospital, I told the doctor that I could not take Darvocet as I had a bad reaction. He refused to give me a different pain med acting like I was crazy. I threw up on the meds after a full abdominal laparotomy. Not cool. The endometriosis and endometriomas came back within months and I was in terrible pain again. I went back to him hoping for help. He said we would have to have a come to Jesus talk and then told me a story of one of his patients that was making herself believe she was in pain because she was hooked on painkillers. Really? I haven't heard of too many cases of magically being cured after endometriosis excision...it GROWS back. I felt dismissed, humiliated and abandoned by the man I trusted with my body and my $25,000 cash payment. Don't trust this guy for endometriosis treatment. Not compassionate."

As parents, he made us feel completely at ease and that our daughter was in great hands. He was thorough, knowledgeable, kind and compassionate. Though I hope we don’t have to see him for another emergency, he would be the first one I would turn to for either of my kids should one arise! I could not speak more highly of Dr. Frykman and my family is so grateful for all he did to help our daughter!!! :-)"

Less then 1% of he population can be affected by it. After suffering for several months, and after an ultrasound ordered by his pediatrician, we were lucky enough to be referred to Dr. Frykman. He knew exactly what e was talking about. Even though we were terrified, his confidence as knowledge on this procedure made us feel so much better. Our sons surgery lasted 8.5 hrs, dr Frykman was and is a genius. He was able to do the surgery laparascopically. Dr Frykman was so kind, informative, reassuring and we were so blessed to be in such great hands. Thank you for what you did for us and our little boy. Without you, he would still be suffering and in pain! We are forever grateful!"

MY son had Pyloric Stenosis and had to have immediate surgery the next day since he had been having projectile vommiting. This Dr. is AMAZING. He made my husband and I feel so comfortable with him performing the surgery and always made sure to come before and after to answer any questions. The surgery only takes a few minutes to go into the baby's stomach and slice a muscle that was not letting milk go through. Dr. Biederman is my son's pediatrician and I'm so thankful for having Dr. Frykman perform the surgery. Just talking to him, you KNOW he knows what he's talking about. He has a great way of making you feel like everything will turn out great and 9 months later, we see it did! Our son has done great and has not thrown up since! Thanks Dr. Frykman!!"

And, on top of that, she is extremely knowledgeable, thorough, helpful, and caring. She made me feel completely comfortable and relaxed. She took a lot of time to talk to me about my concerns, give a thorough exam, and then discuss with me her findings. She really listened to my concerns and answered all of my questions (and I had a lot!). The only down side is that it can take a while to get in to see her because she's in such high demand. Can we clone her, please? The world would be a better place."

She was quick and efficient yet took time with my 19 year old daughter with Crohn's disease to talk and understand the issues. She fit us in immediatly and added her to an already busy day for surgery quickly. She is compassionate and caring, informative and comforting. While the news she delivered was not good, she has a wonderful manner that allowed discussion and options and gave an upset Mom some time to absorb the news. She pretty much rocks and I would refer her to anyone."

Unfortunately her office staff is awful and extremely incompetent, especially her billing person Diane. This is the reason I'll never return or refer her to anyone.

He was there with me through a timely diagnosis of prostate cancer, robotic surgery and speedy recovery. Dr. Ramin explained the complete process with patience and care. I never felt rushed through a visit with him. Dr. Ramin and his team made the whole experience from diagnosis to surgery to recovery a lot easier. Since he has performed hundreds of robotic surgeries , my surgery went very well and I had a very fast recovery."

As a man, the words “Aggressive Prostate Cancer” can strike deep into your psyche as it threatens the very essence of those things that define you as a man. My immediate reaction, which may not be how other men respond, was OK how do I pro-actively fight this thing”. How do you find the right medical partner to help you in this fight? For me, medical practice is not only a science. It is also an art. So you better like and, more importantly trust, the medical partner you select to help you wage the battle. For me, it was Adam Ramin and his staff. Never considered a second opinion. After the initial visit, biopsy and prognosis, there was no doubt in my mind that Dr. Ramin would make a formidable partner. His expertise in robotic surgery, his frank and calculated advice on next steps including the need for advanced radiation if necessary has all lead to a very positive prognosis in my case. Only time will tell. But I know Dr. Ramin will have my back. I trust him...and that is the biggest compliment I can give any doctor."
109,Dr. Soroush A. Ramin,Los Angeles,California, General Surgeons , Male,7,4,2013-08-15T18:18:05Z,1,1,1,1,1,"Very very unprofessional staff. I made an appointment at his North Hollywood office and over the phone I told them exactly what kind of insurance I had. When arrived at my appointment, I was told they didn't accept my insurance. They asked me to pay $150 cash, and since I needed to see a doctor and I had traveled more than 90 minutes to make it there, I decided to pay the fee and I asked them to bill me; however, they didn't even have the decency to do that to make up for their mess up and they wanted the payment in cash. Very very rude staff in addition to the filthy waiting area."

Ramin,Los Angeles,California, General Surgeons , Male,7,4,2012-04-28T14:59:55Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr Ramin is highly trained/experienced/skilled at diagnosis of prostate cancer and nerve-sparing robotic surgery (prostatectomy for me). He is caring, devotes enough time to each concern and the surgery he performed was flawless. A++ in every aspect of diagnosis, explanation of treatment options, surgery, recovery and interpersonal skills. Second opinions from my primary care physician and another highly qualified urologist concurred with Dr. Ramin's diagnosis and treatment plan, and they recommended him as a fine surgeon. Dr. Ramin has had extensive successful experience with this robotic surgical procedure including the nerve sparing aspects to preserve sexual function and sensation. My expectations were exceeded after surgery. I had much less pain than I anticipated. I don't think this was luck. I credit my successful outcome to Dr. Ramin's expertise and minimally-invasive nerve-sparing approach. He is a fine surgeon and very likeable man."

So Pashman suggested that by fusing the lumbar spine, this could be fixed. He makes a big point of balancing the spine by creating a natural lumbar curve (front to back, not laterally as in scoliosis). He fused my spine in such an extreme lordosis that it has caused 24/7 chronic pain due to the freakish posture. He also told me at the last minute, as I was being wheeled into surgery, that he would have to revise the surgery I had as a kid, making the surgery much more extensive than previously described by him. It was a huge surgery and my post operative pain was not controlled well at Cedars Sinai Hospital. Get a second opinion."

Pashman told me that I needed an extremely risky procedure that involved adding more metal to my spine. I got a second opinion, had the hardware removed and have never felt better. When asked to explain the procedure he was suggesting further Pashman reported not having time (this is after sitting in the waiting room 1.5 hours). I would not recommend this surgeon.

I watched him tell my husband that he needed pain management with a 12mm bulge in his disc, rather than surgery, and that he could recommend other doctors who provided boutique like services for his needs. I was so confused that I questioned Dr. Pashman and he LEANED into me as said ""its my perogative as to who I operate on and its not happening, get it?"" I have never dealt with someone as callous as this. Thank GOD we had a referral to another doctor who showed us the MRI and advised that the excruciating pain my husband was experiencing was due to the fact that his nerve was being pinched in 3 places due to the bulge. Dr. Pashman is a conceited, arrogant person."

My pain has diminished greatly and I would recommend him to anyone who is in need of spinal or neck surgery.

I just felt really comfortable with him and I didn't feel pressured in any way. I walked in with very little knowledge of the procedure I was interested in and walked out of the consultation understaning a whole lot more despite the fact I had researched the procedure online. I highly recommend Dr. Smaili to everyone. In fact, my family is also going to have cosmetic surgery with him fairly soon; including my 53 year old mother. I would like to thank Dr. Smaili and his staff for the plesant experience. I'm extremely happy!"

She saw me through everything, and even made the time to come check on me when I woke up. I cant express how grateful I am to have her as my ""angel"" through the whole process. Dr. Smaili was wonderful as well. He answered all my questions, was very personable and even though he was always busy (his wait room is always packed!), he never made me feel rushed. He shows great concern for his clients and their needs. After my surgery, everyone who has felt my breasts couldnt even tell they were implants. My own OBGYN felt them and said, ""I consider myself a professional as I have to touch thousands of breasts for my job, but yours is among the best ones I've seen."" Then he asked for Dr. Smaili's number for his own wife :) If that's not great results, I dont know what is. Thank you Patty and Dr. Smaili!!! xoxo"

He is now working along side his son, who has specialized in the same area of medicine.

Dr. Dandan practices at Scripps Memorial Hospital La Jolla that contracts with Anthem insurance. However, Dr Dandan does not contract with that insurance, yet he sees patients there. Because Dr Dandan under no contract with the insurance, he feels free to bill patients on his own terms. The problem, is that when he comes and sees patients at that hospital, he does not identify himself upfront as a ""free lancer"", effectively hiding his non-affiliation with the insurance. As result, he later bills the patients with excessive fees, which, should he'd been under the contract, would be controlled by the insurance. Such deceptive practice is clearly fraudulent. Beware of that!"
150,Dr. Imad S. Dandan,La Jolla,California, General Surgeons , Male,4,3.75,2014-01-05T23:31:26Z,5,5,5,5,5,"My son had an emergency appendectomy at Scripps Encinitas in August 2013. Dr Dandan was the surgeon. I was worried. I knew nothing about Dr. Dandan, hours earlier my son had been surfing, now he was requiring surgery! The procedure was flawless. Further, apparently my son had an undiagnosed hernia which Dr a Dandan also fixed. When Dr a Dandan came out of the surgery, he was almost smirking, telling me my son was fine, but there was something else. I imagined all sorts of scenarios, such as my son had three testicles, or dome strange pre existing condition. What a relief that the hernia & appendectomy were so expertly done! My son has been pain free since the operation, Dr Dandan did a great job, I have only the best to say about him. Thank you do much!"
151,Dr. Imad S. Dandan,La Jolla,California, General Surgeons , Male,4,3.75,2013-04-27T22:23:16Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Dandan helped save my life after a driver drove me into a tree ( I was a front seat passenger) going around 100+mph. He was the trauma surgeon on call at Scripps La Jolla on the night I was admitted.(by helicopter) I had a TBI and eventually went through 5 neurosurgeries. I truly wonder if I would still be alive if it weren't for the amazing work Dr. Dandan did to save my life. After waking up from a coma that lasted about 6 weeks I felt I was in hell being somewhat conscience in the ICU. I was on 30mg of morphine an hour 24/7, so I was very loopy. From the little that I remember, Dr. Dandan was great...Even on the worst of days he made me smile with his smartass humor(and still does :P) and uplifting attitude. I felt an honest care for a full recovery. God forbid anything this serious happen to you or a loved one, know that having this doctor oversee your care is a true privilege"
152,Dr. Imad S. Dandan,La Jolla,California, General Surgeons , Male,4,3.75,2012-09-07T18:49:27Z,2,2,1,2,3,"This Dr. took forever for follow up visits, however my biggest complaint is the failure for him to disclose charges and his insurance affiliation. Dr. Dandan specifically asked me what my insurance was. When I told him, he said great. What he should have said was, I am out of network with your insurance and you will be responsible for additional charges. I was admitted to the ER for an emergency surgery. I was not given the choice of in or out of network. I have a PPO insurance with a high deductable; however after the deductable I have 100 percent coverage. It was a bit of a shock to get an additional $4,000 dollar bill from the surgeon because he is out of network. Shouldn’t you tell the patient this information if you are not going to accept what the insurance company is going to pay you? I would have gladly waited for someone else, post surgical infection and overall terrible experience."

154,Dr. Stevan R. Clark,Los Angeles,California, General Surgeons , Male,2,4.5,2008-10-21T23:47:01Z,4.5,4,4,5,5,"This doctor was great! The staff was nice, I waited the average amount of time, and the doctor was very thorough and knowledgable. My prognosis turned out to be a simple cyst which my general Dr. should have been able to identify. I felt dumb for seeing a surgeon for something that should have been taken care of by my physician but Dr. Clark was really nice about it and went over all the information I needed tfor future occurances. I would definitely trust this doctor in surgery."

He talks at you and doesn't care to have dialogue. He is egotistical and has terrible bed side manners. He thinks in terms of dollars and how he can perform another surgery even if it mean withholding the truth. 
157,Dr. Jeffrey A. Hagen,Los Angeles,California, General Surgeons , Male,9,3.11,2011-03-07T19:11:31Z,4.8,5,4,5,5,He saved my life! His interns sucked but it is a teaching hospital. He was very knowledgable ands had great bedside manner with humor. Brilliant man!

He was rude, discourteous, arrogant, ill-informed and someone that your surprised is even a doctor. He did not take the time to listen to our concerns. We had initially been referred by our primary. In asking around we heard about many complications by him and botched surgeries. I recommend that you do your research before considering Dr Jeffrey Hagen and be informed. We decided he was not what our family needed and we didnt want to risk our loved ones outcome at the hands of this doctor."
159,Dr. Jeffrey A. Hagen,Los Angeles,California, General Surgeons , Male,9,3.11,2010-06-03T19:10:32Z,4.8,5,4,5,5,"Dr. Hagen was all about doing his best for his patient. He got down to the facts, then the business of planning a possible cure for his patient. His nurse assistant was very helpful, and I could tell she had worked from experience. I, the patient's wife, was told what we were up against in a sincere and compassionate, yet positive outlook. I felt compassion from both doctor and nurse, both before surgery and after. We had great results, and my husband has had extended years of a normal life...so far. I can only thank the surgeon for his devotion and tireless help. It's easy to criticize when a life is on the line, but take into consideration what these professionals go through to help the terminally ill. I praise Doctor Hagen for his courage, his fortitude, and his honesty."

First hiatial hernia surgery, second surgery to repair damage to ribs and chestwall caused by first surgery. Ribs did not heal properly and three years later hernia needs repair again. Hernia surgery was performed by going through her back which might have caused extensive damage to ribs. Upcoming surgery to be performed by different surgeon through the front. Last consultation with Dr. Hagen, my wife now suffers from permanent nerve damage caused by previous two surgeries. No libel, just fact."

I had very difficult case - very large hiatal hernia that had allowed stomach to turn upside down and migrate almost entirely into the chest cavity. Numerous doctors failed to diagnose. He figured it out and fixed it right the first time. I didn't like the length of time it took to get initial appointment (about 2 months) and time to get all the tests scheduled (another 2 months).

Dr. Matsuoka diagnosed severe gall bladder disease, with a 2 cm stone lodged in the bile duct that prevented bile from reaching my intestines and it was spilling back into my blood. Efforts to remove it or shatter it with laser were unproductive. She performed abdominal surgery and cut the bile duct and removed the stones and placed a bypass in. Eight weeks later, she made a special trip in when it was pouring rain on a Saturday, as I could only get in on the weekend. I am fully recovered. Her bedside consultations were excellent and professional. She is highly intelligent, supberly trained, and a genetically blessed surgeon. I recommend her to anyone.

215,Dr. Dario Perez,Los Angeles,California, General Surgeons , Male,5,2.6,2008-09-22T18:49:09Z,5,5,5,5,5,Dr. Dario Perez and his son Dr. Jose Peres are both outstanding surgeons with a excellant people skills. They are able to explain your medical condition so that you really understand. They spend a appropiate amount of time with their patients no rushing in and out. They have a way of making you feel like family and you get treated as if you are one of the family. They listen to you and answer all your questions until your comfortable and satisfied. I've had several procedures done. I'm happy with the results. There office staff is outstanding and very friendly. The apmosphere in his office is relaxing not like your normal doctors office. As soon as you enter door you like in someone living room. The smell and music make you relax and feel as though you're in good hands. There are many surgeons throughout the worlds but these are the only 2 that I would put my life in their hands. I would recommend Dr. Dario Perez and his son Dr. Jose Perez to my family and friends.

He discharged me from the outpatient unit in a dangerous condition after watching a disastrous incident in post op where he did nothing. He did no scan to check on my condition which would have shown that the entire surgical repair had been destroyed and serious additional harm was done to my lung. 2 days later my heart went into a-fib from pain and I was rushed to Mission Hospital where my life was saved.

He does not listen, he dismisses, he gets defensive and well, I could go on and on. Not to mention the cow that works for him at the front desk who is a condescending , angry, unkind woman. This was the most traumatic experience of my life. I've been referring anyone with my condition to another doctor."

He listened, was attentive, and most importantly--responded to my concerns appropriately. I feel really blessed to have met him!"

Would trust him with my life any day . My pain is gone-scar is minimal. He had the most pleasant -calming and confident presence about him during our first appointment. I was immediately positive he was the best doctor for my surgery . I was very scard to go for the spine surgery, but he was so brilliant in his discription of the procedure, and confident that I would be fine that I was able to walk right in - and walk out two days later , smiling. Recovery went exactly as he said it would -a full recovery. He's brilliant."

He did not show up for emergency surgery, left me with post surgery confusion for 27 hours (dressing left on he would not let anyone change it) and it took the hospital brass to get him in the room to deal with the mess he made of my body. Upon showing up with at best described a muscle goon of a nurse he tried to rip down my panties and gown and remove the bandages with his bare hands. He than declared himself the captain of the ship and marched around. Refused to answer questions on the surgery, the pumps hanging out of me,recovery time. He had to be fired and I know suffer from extreme issues to come , pumps remain in me and we are terrified.
The explanation for his behavior - 'Well he is used to the uninsured people'
I am well insured & terrified from those who are not who cross his path.

Dr Tang has a gentle, calming temperament and yet has a thorough, up-to-date knowledge of his specialty that put me at ease. Dr Tang actually listened to my concerns and took steps for my care that went beyond his scope as a surgeon. I am most grateful for Dr Tang as a highly-skilled, up- to- date surgeon but for being a caring human being. I was also delighted to find his staff responsive to all my needs and in a surprisingly sufficient manner. Kudos to Dr Tang and his Staff.

On my first visit I had a sigmoidoscopy. With other offices there is a preliminary appointment. Kaiser's efficiency and the expertise of the scheduling staff (Ronnie) saved me both effort and waiting .
This doctor is gentle and considerate. He doesn't make jokes, but invites the patient to by his manner
I've never had a physician who wants to look at all previous. I found him quite thorough and am happy to be under his care. I have confidence that he has a broad range of skills regarding options for colon problems. He looks quite stern in the USC video ( which you should watch), but is quite pleasant in person. "

It took numerous calls just to get my appointment scheduled. They couldn't figure out how to schedule an appointment through their computer system when it asked a couple insurance questions when booking. When I went for my appointment all went well when checking in, then they put me in my room to wait for Dr. Kaiser. I waited over an hour and a half for him before finally leaving. Really and hour and a half and he didn't even stick his head in the room to say he was running late. Obviously, he doesn't want new patients. thanks for wasting 3 hours of my life, I will send be sending a bill for my time."

But seriously, to me, she seems like she has a serious lack of knowledge. She didn't even know what PCOS is. I had to explain what it is to her. She never gives straight answers as far as diagnosing because she doesn't know herself. I went to another doctor the day after I saw her and got diagnosed, scheduled a surgery, and I'm all better now. It is true that she likes to sit down with her patients and talk to them. She does like to talk - A LOT. She talked to me for about 45 minutes- about everything under the sun - EXCEPT the thing that I came in for."

Dr.Rivera merely did nothing but come off very offensive because I did not have (ppo). Never once did he ask if I had a secondary insurance, being that I am under the age of 26 and under the law I have to have insurance under my parents. Everytime I asked him about my condition he would vaguely answer then tell me but you would have to come out of pocket. He never referred me to another surgeon. He was definitely all about money. Furthermore I ended up with a staph infection from the hospital and I am now having to wait until the infection is gone so that I can get back to the real issue that I went into the hospital for. "

He cut my left wrist to start prepping me for HemoDialysis, we switched from PD as we were told it was easier. Well-in one surgery he told me if he didn't find good veins in the wrist that he'd installed a graft inside the elbow area, for lack of a better term. He did neither. He cut my wrist and inside the elbow too-yet did not install a graft. So-two nurses checked both out and told me that i'd need one more surgery. I saw Dr. Rigberg at the UCLA Hospital of Santa Monica, CA. He cut me three times with the intent of getting me ready for dialysis. I'm an End Stage Renal Disease patient. And have not yet been dyalized. It's been months now. The only thing I have to show for it is that my left forearm and some two fingers on my left hand are falling asleep and are getting cold. Also that my blood is more toxic with anesthetics & am newly incontinent.This experience kills the fight in 1"

Our NICU Dr. knew of Dr. Stein and asked him if he would try to do the surgery even though Sean was so tiny. We were so thrilled he saiid yes. Dr. Stein can be a bit arrogant, BUT he knows what to do and how to do it. If he is at a loss, he will seek help or ideas from his collegues. He will add us to the schedule to be seen if a feeding tube has come out or we have a concern. The best general surgeon at CHLA by far."

I've been to him twice and after this last time I will not go back to him. He's abrupt bordering on rude, his examing rooms are very cramped and clausterphobic. He seems not to take the time to really listen to his patients concerns, is dismissive and if it's not ""his way"" it's not going to happen. When he did do surgery on me @ Cedars' Outpatient Surgery Center, I felt like a # and it was like an assembly line where the patients needs and concerns were really not addressed at the time as they were in a hurry to stay ontime and get you out the door since the space in their is limited. There's another doctor in his office who is much better and much more personable and communicative than Wood is."

Waited over two hours for my first visit and eventually walked out after being told that it would be 45 minutes. The front desk was polite, but the fact that such a thing could happen, especially when I was being screened for potential cancer is completely unprofessional. Imagine if I, a lawyer, missed the doctor's malpractice hearing and he therefore lost his case.
