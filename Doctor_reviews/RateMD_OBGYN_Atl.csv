I’d like to share my story. This self-directed learning library, Dr. Sinervo and Dr. Arrington at the Center for Endometriosis in Atlanta saved my life. I started my period when I was twelve years old. From age 12 to 36, every single period included nausea, vomiting, extreme fatigue, severe back pain, food sensitivities, bloating and painful bowel movements. For years, I was not taken seriously by medical professionals. Everyone here knows what it’s like to feel marginalized and misdiagnosed. In my case, I believe my legitimate medical concerns were dismissed both due to the lack of knowledge/skill of physicians but also due to the fact that I was in the foster care system. For these reasons, I was told that my pain was in my head. I was told that I needed therapy. I was told that if I was throwing up that much, I must have an eating disorder. (While I certainly understand that needing therapy or having an eating disorder are valid medical diagnoses that should always be addressed, those diagnoses were incorrect for me). I was told that I was just complaining for attention. I was told that periods are just painful. Once, I was told by a doctor that food sensitivities were a fad and that if I really wanted to gain weight, I should go home and eat a pizza. None of the boxes doctors put me in were valid. The truth is, all those years, I had deep and widespread endometriosis, and I needed proper care. After suffering all through undergrad and law school with undiagnosed endometriosis, I took a full-time job at a university and began dating my current partner, David. Unfortunately, in June of last year, after working for my employer for more than 5 years, my disease became so debilitating, and I was let go from my job. I decided to go to Emory, the same place I’d been going for 3 years for my women’s health needs, to get answers. Finally, Emory decided to operate to explore the possibility of endometriosis...a word I had never heard before. I had surgery at Emory in July of 2018. At my post op appointment, I asked my surgeon if I underwent excision or ablation surgery. She said they were the same thing. I told her that I still had pain, and she encouraged me to see my primary care physician about that. I do want to note that this OBGYN surgeon is very well respected in her field and did her best. Unfortunately, she is NOT an endometriosis expert qualified to properly treat my disease. Within 2 months of the surgery at Emory, all the pain and all the symptoms had returned. I was jobless, extremely sick, and I needed answers. I didn’t need a support group. I needed direct, life-saving answers. That’s when I found Nancy’s Nook. That’s when I found Dr. Sinervo, Dr. Arrington and the Center for Endometriosis in Atlanta. After reviewing my case, Dr. Sinervo agreed to take me on as a patient. During a time when some partners would have been running for the hills, David sat me down, told me that we’d get through this and proposed. I said yes. Then, I met with Dr. Sinervo regarding my surgery that would take place at Northside Hospital. When I spoke to him, he said, “I believe you.” He heard me. He had unmatched compassion. I had surgery on January 7, 2019. I feel better than I have EVER felt. I have an appetite, I’m gaining weight, my endometriosis pain is relieved and my energy level is improving. I am working through some back pain with physical therapy and light yoga. It’s working. Nancy understands that the self-directed library model is what people need to truly advocate for themselves. I’m grateful that Dr. Sinervo and Dr. Arrington have made it their life’s work to properly and compassionately treat endometriosis. Because of Nancy’s Nook and the Center for Endometriosis, I get to wake up without pain. I get to eat without worrying about whether I’ll get sick. I get to plan my wedding and walk down the aisle to officially get the family I’ve always wanted WITHOUT PAIN. I have my life back. I’m forever grateful. "

I have never had a better experience than I did with Dr Sinervo and his staff. I came from Birmingham AL to have surgery there. I only wish every physician was as kind and compassionate as Dr. Sinervo. I can't believe how amazing he is. He prayed with me before my surgery (which is just standard for him) and held my hand during the time in the OR before I fell asleep to keep me calm and at ease. He hugged me and my Mom so many times because he's just KIND and I absolutely love him for how he helped me!!! I wish every woman would be able to come to him for their needs. I personally had Ovarian Remnant Syndrome and I won't have any issues now thanks to him! Prior to meeting him I had already had three surgeries for that specific condition that never quite fixed the issue. He is so knowledgeable and caring. I wish every woman I know could to go to him!! Best doctor ever!!! Amazing!!

I had surgery in Feb. for endometriosis, as well as an appendectomy and cholecystectomy. After years of being told there was nothing really wrong with me by other providers, to have Dr Sinervo tell me that he would be prepared for any level of disease gave me such peace.

I had recurring catemenial pneomothorax and other issues do to endometriosis for years. Dr.Sinervo chose the best solution for me after having had other procedures by others physicians that did not help. When he went in to do the surgery he discovered another issue where the endometriosis had caused my diaphragm to rupture. Dr.Sinervo was so great at explaining the situation and getting me the best cardio thoracic Dr to fix that issue. He even made time to see me before that surgery and pray with me. There really couldn't be a better doctor than Dr. Ken Sinervo. I thank him so much for giving me my life back.

They genuinely care about their patients. When they say they are there for you they mean it. When I developed an issue after returning home they worked with the physicians here to make sure I was receiving the best care possible. They educated myself and my husband about tests, procedures, etc. When things did not work out with the physician here they stepped up to take care of me in Atlanta. The entire staff has made sure I am comfortable during the entire process. Dr. Sinervo has been incredible at keeping myself and my husband informed. He cares for his patients and it is apparent we are a priority. I will forever be grateful to him and the staff at the CEC for making sure I am able to get my life back. I know I am free of endometriosis since Dr. Sinervo was able to check during my last surgery. I can definitely tell the difference already and am happy to say I no longer experience any of my former endometriosis pain. My only wish is that I would have found him sooner! But I am excited to get back to my active lifestyle very soon! "

Sinervo,Atlanta,Georgia, Gynecologists (OBGYN) , Male,154,4.91,2019-01-26T18:44:12.753Z,5,5,5,5,5,"I am 5 days post-op and feeling better than I have after any of my previous endo related surgeries, performed by other doctors over the past 7 years. Dr. Sinervo was referred to me by one of his former patients; and for me, it was like the difference between having my life back or continuing to let my endo take everything good from me in my life on a daily basis. Dr. Sinervo almost sounded too good to be true; I was almost too scared to even get my hopes up- especially after numerous of doctors/specialists, 20 years of pain, multitudes of misdiagnoses, days of unnecessary picking and prodding like a lab rat, 2 un-successful surgeries, etc. From the moment I spoke with Dr. Sinervo on the phone directly to my post-op appointment with him less than just 48 hours ago, I've felt nothing but confidence in his ability to get me back to the person I was before endo took control of my life. His professionalism is unparalleled; his compassion is genuine; his ability to connect as a male in this field, rare. He took every precaution necessary or thinkable in making my surgery (pre, during, and post) the most effective and successful as it could be. He took the time to explain my procedures and conditions to me in terms I could understand and allowed me the opportunity to ask questions. I never once felt rushed or pressured; he allowed me the time I needed and never showed any sign of impatience (and I know he's a busy man). I felt like he was genuinely interested in me as a patient; he was personable and animated- what I value in a provider (some appropriate, candid humor is much more appealing than a monotone robot). Both me and Dr. Sinervo feel very optimistic about my prognosis post-op; and as I've already mentioned, I'm already feeling much better than I have at this point compared to previous surgeries by other providers to treat the same conditions(s). I have more hope than I ever have, and there is great joy in the confidence within Dr. Sinvero's statement of ""the endo is finally gone"". I expect a new life now, and feel good about it. If anyone reading this has never had this type of surgery before, gas pain is completely normal (but it feels like Dr. Sinervo's staff are fully prepared to help manage this better than any others I have encountered). Recovery is going well so far- and this is coming from someone who has been told in the past 1.5 years by 4 different doctors that I was going to have to have a hysterectomy ASAP. I did NOT have a hysterectomy- and I think I'm finally going to have my life back- at the end of this recovery (I will have to do the recommend pelvic floor PT for full pain elimination- something no other doctor, except for Dr. Sinervo, had taken the time to explain)- all thanks to Dr. Sinervo. I am forever indebted.

Sinervo,Atlanta,Georgia, Gynecologists (OBGYN) , Male,154,4.91,2018-12-13T06:19:12.052Z,5,5,5,5,5,"My mother and grandmother both had to have hysterectomies with intestinal resection in their thirties due to severe endometriosis. My symptoms started at 13 years old. Luckily, my incredible mother did her research and found Dr. Sinervo. During my first appointment with him at fifteen years old, it was decided that I would need to undergo surgery. I was a very hormonal and terrified teenager. The process of endo surgery (pre, during, and post) is not glamorous and quite overwhelming, especially for such a young child. However, going through the process, I don’t believe there is a single person in the world that could have been as comforting and reassuring as Dr. Sinervo. I had previously been seen by a myrdiad of gynecologists, including pediatric specialists. None had such a reassuring bedside manner as him.
The day of my surgery, I was incredibly nervous. I was heavily sedated once in the surgical area but Dr. Sinervo still asked if I would like to hold his hand and pray. This is a memory I have spoken of for years.
Apparently, when I woke up and spoke to him, the first thing I asked was, “will I be able to have kids?” I remember asking again at a post oppointment. This has always been so important to me.
I am now 21 years old and am coming to the end of my undergraduate pre-veterinary medicine education. I have worked 3 physical jobs consecutively throughout my undergraduate education. My life was completely changed by the surgery that Dr. Sinervo performed. I have been able to function normally throughout my periods since my surgery. If it weren’t for this change, I’m not sure I would have been so successful.
I am looking forward to the next chapter of my life as I am confident that my reproductive health has been in the best care.
I would highly recommend Dr. Sinervo to any patient struggling with endometriosis. I am so thankful for him and my mother for so uniquely and expertly guiding me through this treatment in the midst of my teenage angst. I look back on this experience with only positivity. "

I have never had a nicer and more caring Dr and would recommend him to ANYONE who has endometriosis issues.

Him and his staff take the time to answer even the smallest concerns (BTW- I am one of those people that google EVERYTHING and freak myself out). They have never rushed through my appointments. I unfortunately had a miscarriage in my 3rd pregnancy and they were very helpful and supportive throughout the whole process (I was actually the first patient to have a miscarriage since they opened their Canton office and they took very good care of me). He assured me that it was normal and that I would be able to conceive again without any problems. And sure enough I was back in his office several months later. Dr. Scott has a great personality and he is very respectful. Every time my husband and I are in his office we get to hear one of his crazy life stories! Very funny guy and I recommend him to all of my friends!

Scott,Atlanta,Georgia, Gynecologists (OBGYN) , Male,40,4.68,2017-12-19T00:03:25.246Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Based on my personal experience, I should say that under Dr. Scott’s care, it’s the best OBGYN experience I’ve had. He did an excellent job in making me feel comfortable during my appointments. The people from Peachtree Women's are very helpful, courteous and attentive. Though I was initially hesitant about having a male doctor, Dr. Scott is skillful, talented, and experienced. I couldn’t have picked a better doctor myself and he has been helping me deal with my polycystic ovarian syndrome (or PCOS), sharing with me the treatments and all the medical assistance I need, from getting a workup, to ultrasound checks and other lab tests, as well as my annual pap smear. He has taught me diet and lifestyle hacks to help improve my quality of life and even the other patients of his can say the same thing. Peachtree Women's really does provide the highest quality and most compassionate healthcare any woman of any age can possibly want. Amazing place with amazing doctors. I highly recommend them!
When I was younger, I dreaded going to clinics for gynecological or female health care. But as life went on, I eventually got married and time came when my husband and I wanted to have a child of our own. We’ve been seeing different doctors at Peachtree but one of our favorite is Dr. Garcia. He is quite an amazing doctor who is intelligent, attentive, very patient, and always follows through and follows up. I like his style and he’s a great listener as well as explains things clearly. Everyone at the Peachtree is really nice. They are very efficient and organized. I’ve gotten all my ultrasounds and personalized lab tests and the doctors always thoroughly explain the results in a way that I can understand them. Medical speak can be intimidating but the doctors make you feel comfortable and really know how to break it down in layman’s terms. During the infertility evaluation that we had, we were offered basic assessments of fertility that included preconception counselling. I am aware that getting pregnant in my case can be challenging but I am confident with the doctors we’re working with who are very professional and have taken time to discuss all the options available to us. Can’t wait for our next appointment!"

He was 1 hour and 36 minutes late for his first appointment of the day, walked in and gave me about 4 minutes of his time (he was dressed in casual clothes and not scrubs so him being on call was not the issue). I have very large babies on my side of the family and my husbands family also has a history of babies over 9 lbs. I tried to explain to Dr. Scott that because of this I was concerned about my babies size at full-term and wanted an honest opinion about large babies and first time mothers, advice on whether a scan in the 3rd trimester was recommended, and the likelihood of cesarean sections with babies over 9 lbs. Was told that I wasn't a ""small-statured person being that I'm over 5'8"" tall"" and my concerns were flippantly disregarded as he rushed to get to his next appointment that he was neglecting in another exam room. I didn't realize the size of your birth canal was directly tied to your height. My mother who is also my size had to have a cesarean with my sister because my sisters head literally could not fit through my mother's pelvis and later had a scheduled cesarean with me. The practice he works with is filled with talented, caring, knowledgeable, and concerned physicians, take your appointments with them. I have had to come up with a backup plan to ensure that this doctor not deliver my child should he be on call when I go into labor. "

Dr. Nezhat is one of the most phenomenal doctors and surgeons you could ever imagine, and he told the office to work with me no matter what on the finances to make sure that I could get the surgery I desperately needed. I have been through so much earth-shattering, horrific hell from 18 years of endometriosis pain. He is validating, kind, a total sweetheart, humble but confident, has an AMAZING team, and he was able to instantly feel endometriosis adhesions in places my other doctors completely missed during physical exams. Further, he was able to effectively operate on things that other doctors told me were inoperable, and other decent-but-not-as-good 'experts' couldn't quite clean up ins. He uses surgical techniques that are cutting edge, and I was able to get surgery within a week of my first consult. I'm a month post-op, and I'm now virtually symptom free. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!!"

He is a brilliant, caring and very devoted physician. He was able to diagnose my wife's problem when 5 other specialists could not. He was confident and his team was excellent. He performed a very comprehensive, delicate surgery without any complications and with great results. As another physician, I can understand the skill that it takes to complete such a procedure time and time again so successfully. He is a genius, and it is an honor for him and his team to take care of my wife. We greatly appreciate his help and the help of his entire time."

He operated laparoscopically, using the Da Vinci robot for the hysterectomy and oopharectomy. The bladder and rectal repair were done vaginally. The surgery took, I believe, 7 hours. My recovery time was amazingly brief - I could have been discharged the following morning, but chose to stay an extra night, as my home town is 110 miles away, and I wanted to be close to Dr Nezhat ""just in case"". I experienced very little pain, and, following a two-week period of being careful, was back to normal life in a very short time.

I had read that the CEC was top notch in excision of endometriosis, and they definitely are. I was able to have an appointment with Dr. Kongoasa soon after since I am local and met with Dr. Sinervo right before my surgery. They were both knowledgeable and answered all of my questions. They did find and excise endometriosis and have been helpful during my recovery and answer any questions that come up. Dr. Sinervo who did my surgery was very kind and showed my parents photos and explained everything that he found right after the surgery. I would highly recommend Dr. Sinervo or Dr. Kongoasa if you suspect endometriosis. The staff at the CEC are also amazing and personable, I really felt that they cared about me."

As a specialist, I felt very safe in his hands knowing he had the experience and knowledge that previous OBs I had seen did not have in the realm of endometriosis. The staff is very welcoming and kind, and has provided me with a lot of strength and support. Wendy, the head surgical nurse, is so warm and thoughtful. I felt extremely comfortable with Dr. Kongoasa and his whole team. One note is that Dr. Kongoasa does practice Catholic medicine, meaning he does not prescribe birth control or IUDs unless extremely necessary for pain. So if you bring this up to him, he may not discuss birth control options with you extensively, but anyone else at his practice can help you with that, and Dr. Kongoasa usually recommends talking with a colleague or other OBGYN about that."

He respected my wishes to have a Hysterectomy for suspected Adenomyosis because I wasn't comfortable with the odds of a PSN working for me. He respected all of my wishes, addressed all of my concerns, and answered all of my questions. The staff at the CEC are remarkably friendly, the nursing staff is skilled, and the building itself is comfortable rather than ""sterile"" and medical. My surgery experience with Dr. K was nothing short of remarkable. First, he and the nurses/medical staff prayed with me before surgery at my request (if you prefer not to pray, he will not ask/force you to). He keenly identified even the most subtle endometriosis and excised it COMPLETELY, leaving no trace of disease behind. His staff provided my husband with HOURLY updates, and even upheld my half-conscious pre-op request to tell my husband I loved him with each update. Dr. K gave my husband photos and updated him on what he did during surgery. I would recommend bringing a recording device so that whomever Dr. K updates will have information ready for you post-surgery, as Dr. K may not be able to see you after surgery. The post-op visit was non-invasive, and Dr. K gave me yet another hug at the end of my visit. I've never met a doctor quite like Dr. K. From the combination of being soft-spoken and friendly, yet confident and direct, to his warm half-smile, to his hugs at the end of every visit, Dr. K is a tremendously skilled surgeon that any endometriosis/adenomyosis patient should consider seeing!"

While he was exploring me he used just one glove for the hand that was using. Might sound like something without importance but since he was touching my thigh to try to make me relax (with the opposite effect, of course), that made me feel ten times more uncomfortable. He is a nice person, I'm sure he is a great doctor. Also, I have a cat and I had to DEMAND the toxoplasmosis test when I got pregnant, because he said it wasn't necessary.
His nurse is AMAZING though."

I had to request to be checked on 2 days after the emergency c section while at northside. The experience was pretty bad. I won’t have a second child with this practice.

He stops without hesitation/irritation, listens to my questions and gives me answers that do not make me feel nervous/anxious, stupid or afraid. He does a really good job at making you feel comfortable physically and mentally. My only not so great comment that I have is that I was not given all options available to me regarding an issue that needed to be addressed. Although the procedure he recommended has the best outcome rates and the after effects are similar, it would have been nice to know that there was another option so that I could weigh the pros and cons of each....even if I did agree with his choice.

Indeed, I regard him as a genius. Dr. Randell is an excellent and highly skilled surgeon in this field who has dedicated his life and career to promoting the reproductive health and well being of women. He is truly dedicated to his patients and provides them with the kind of focused, conscientious and sustained care rarely offered in other places. I learned about his practice on the internet and got in touch last December when I sensed that my fibroid situation was worsening. My abdomen was protruding more and more, to the point that it resembled the size of a five-month pregnancy, and the symptoms were becoming more uncomfortable and unbearable. I wasn’t satisfied with the recommendations that I received in the town where I live, from an Ob-Gyn whose first suggestion had been a hysterectomy several years ago, to a radiologist who kept suggesting that I was a “good candidate” for UAE to shrink them. On 7/20/2018, Dr. Randell removed all 74 fibroids from my uterus through an abdominal myomectomy. I still can’t believe the staggering number. Seeing the photo helped me understand just how many there were. This shows me that I’d never even been properly diagnosed or fully evaluated for them until I visited Dr. Randell’s office. This was shocking when considering that I’d had two open abdominal myomectomies in the past. The first one was at age 26 in 1998, in which 1 or maybe 2 fibroids were removed; I was treated with Depot Lupron on the road to it. The second was at age 37 in 2008, in which 5 fibroids were removed; I’d briefly been treated with Danazol by the Ob-Gyn doctor who came with my health plan before meeting the IVF surgeon who performed that surgery. It wasn’t until after my second surgery that I even began to hear some stories of how many fibroids were possible for women to have. I never imagined that I had a high number myself, especially as a tall, thin woman. The expertise of Dr. Randell diagnosed and addressed this problem at an entirely different level and gave me the help and solutions I needed. I feel so much better, renewed and rebuilt with an opportunity to live again and reach my fullest potential in my life and work. I am truly privileged and blessed to have been treated by a top-notch surgeon like Dr. Randell."

It was only three small incisions done, and my recovery time was outstanding. I received a call from him directly after the second day home from surgery to check on me. I thought that was awesome! He is very personable and passionate about his work. Dr. Randell gave me several pictures of my surgery process to review, and he gave me encouragement about being able to conceive. I am very pleased that I chose to have the procedure done robotically. The procedure only took a couple of hours, and he's an awesome surgeon! I would definitely recommend him for any fibroid removals. "

I was so much in pain I was at the emergency almost every weekend and the doctor wanted to place me on Lupron to throw me into menopause and or perform another surgery on me that would take me 6 weeks to heal. I couldn't afford to be out of work. Then I did my research and decided to seek a second opinion with Dr. Randell which am glad I did because as soon as I sat with me to evaluate me, I knew I had come to the right person, he ordered MRI and showed I had a lot of Fibroids and big one right in my Uterus, he assured me, he will take care of it, I was still not 100% convinced. Long story short I had the second Surgery with Dr. Randell and it was the best experience ever. I have just been cleared for 6 weeks Post surgery, and there aren't any signs of Fibroids, everything gone, my period came and it was just normal. I feel great. I just wanna say thank you so much for giving me my life back, I don't know what pains feels like anymore.

It was so large that it was pushing my other organs out of the way. Another cyst on my right ovary and a fibroid in my uterus. I went to another OBGYN who told me I would need to be cut open and would never have children. I'm only 25 and I want a big family. (Like 7 kids big) We found doctor Randell and from the very first appointment he was amazing. So confident and knowledgeable. He told me everything I needed to be prepared. The surgery went better than expected! He some how removed an 18cm robotically through my belly button! The surgery was very minimally invasive and it doesn't hurt at all while I'm I recovery. He somehow preserved my ovary and uterus and I still can have that big family that I want! I seriously thank God for Doctor Randell. What he is doing is amazing. The fact that he specializes in this makes it better. Such a heart for women and not at all like other doctors!"

Not only is she smart as a whip, but she is the kindest, gentlest, and warmest doctor I have ever met. Being pregnant with my first child, I was very picky and wanted nothing short of the best from an OB/GYN. That is exactly what I got and then some! Dr. Soufi always took time to explain things to me and really made me feel like she cared deeply for me and my baby’s well-being. She was always very quick to respond to my messages sent through the portal. For example, I sent a message on a Sunday once just thinking to myself that I would hear back the next day and about an hour later, she called me. I was completely shocked! Dr. Soufi has an enormous amount of compassion and always made me feel comfortable. The delivery of my little girl went very well and I couldn’t ask for more. An added bonus is she has the best assistant in the world, Torie!! Absolutely love them as a team and felt completely taken care of. I am hoping GOD blesses with another child and if so, it’s a no brainer that I’ll be going right back to Dr. Soufi!"

She has an extraordinary ""bedside"" manner and explains your medical assessment in a very clear and concise manner. She really cares about her patients and listens intensely to their health concerns. Unfortunately for me, I've always dealt with high risk pregnancies. So locating a gentle, informed, and thorough physician was always our top priority. We couldn't imagine finding all of the qualities (and more) we were looking for in Dr, Soufi. We always left her office feeling assured that every precaution was taken to ensure a healthy and safe delivery. We were ""NEVER"" disappointed!!

She is thorough, caring, professional, attentive, and most important to me....she listened to all my questions and concerns!!! She delivered 2 of my babies and one was a premie and she took THE BEST care of me and my baby!!!! With my last pregnancy, she took even better care of me to make sure my third baby got the BEST CARE to help prevent preterm labor for a second time! After delivery she always checked on me HERSELF and when I needed extra attention, she ALWAYS answered the nurses call to request additional meds or what ever I needed!!! I never had to wait for care after delivering by babies!!!! Again, if you are looking for a doctor to take care of you and your baby...LOOK NO FURTHER!!! Dr. Soufi and her staff are amazing!!! Please keep in mind that because Dr. Soufi is amazing, she sometimes may have an emergency that may interrupt your appointment because she will have to leave to go to the hospital. Therefore, your wait time might be longer. However, keep in mind if she is your doctor and you have an emergency, I'm sure you would want her to do the same for you!! So please be patient and stick with her! You will not regret it!!!

She is conservative in her practices, always looking out for the patient. She asks for your input and lets you be involved in your care. Her practice takes call for their own patients during the week. This can make for longer wait times for appointments, but you have a greater chance of your doctor delivering you. She delivered all three of my children after her office hours. She stayed late to see each delivery through and made sure everything went well, which it did!"

I came to her with Stage IV Endometriosis. From the first appointment, I could tell how attentive and patient she is with her patients. She listened to me, let me share my concerns and worked with me to create a plan. She was there during every step of my struggle, even when I was technically out of her care. It has been 9 months since my last surgery and I recently had a check up. I was so happy to share the amazing progress that I have had over the last several months. Dr. Stepanian is the kind of caring person that doesn’t just take note of your accomplishments, but rejoices with you in them. I could go on and on about how compassionate she is, however, I do not want to leave out the fact that she is a meticulous surgeon and is constantly working on new research and innovations in her field. Do not let the thought of a slight wait in her office keep you from getting the care you need. This only means that she takes her time and listens to her patients, giving thorough attention to each person she sees. I am so thankful to Dr. Stepanian, not only for the amazing results, but for being there at every step of the way."

I commence this review with informative & genuine sentiments. Dr. Assia A. Stepanian practices with genuine compassion. Once again, she has delivered beyond exceptional care to me & some of my family members & friends & even their parents etc. She went above & beyond & coordinated her schedule to be present during my high risk & major surgery.!!! This is rare indeed, if not nonexistent! She ensured that I was in the absolute best hands & my trust in her was already firm but it intensified more. She collaborated with a brilliant physician, Dr. Joseph Boveri, who is smooth, cool, experienced, an excellent listener, respecter of ones views of their health approach & more. Together they partnered up & helped me tremendously. Because Dr. Stepanian was present, I felt at ease & at peace mentally & at heart. Dr. Stepanian did not close me out or turn me away despite my complex medical condition. Having her present meant more than the world to me! She came by to check on me multiple times, called me after a long days work & texted me & responded to my texts despite her extremely busy schedule. She will ALWAYS be my blessing & dear one! I continue to pass her cards out even to complete strangers. If only the world were full of Dr. Assia A. Stepanian's, women's health care would be on another level in a positive way!

I love this lady! After getting away -- no RUNNING FAST -- From Dr. Felicia Dawson in Midtown, I stumbled upon Dr. Step. in my search for holistic gynecologist. Dr. Stepanian has a wonderful bedside manner. Though you may have to wait on occasion, her svc is well worth it. She's very cordial, friendly, knowledgeable and most importantly, she's thorough! My previous gyno just blew off my pelvic pain and abnormal bleeding. Said it was not gynecologic in nature, that I need to see a gastroenterologist. Nonsense! But thanks to Dr. Stepanian, the problem was identified. She was very skilled in removing some polyps and monitoring the thickness of my uterine lining. The only thing that I feel like I miss out on is consultation/advice regarding diet, weight, lifestyle and overall health maintenance. I expected this to be part of the holistic gynecology approach. A lot of patients don't want to hear their gyno talk to them about losing weight and mental issues and stress, but at the end of the day, our health is wholly integrated. It's all connected. Anytime I get serious about dealing with what I'm eating and what's eating me, I watch all of my gynecologist problem improve!!! (With no co-pay required!) And that's the kind of approach I expect to get from a holistic practitioner. Still, I wouldn't trade Dr. Assia Stepanian for ALL my previous gynecologists combined! :-)"

She was very nice and seemed to be knowledgeable overall. I DO NOT like the staff! It is hard to find out any information on your own test results. I called and requested a return call from someone to get more information on my test results and did not receive a return call. I then called again 2 days ago and requested Dr. Garcia give me a return call due to the nurse never called me back. As of today I have still not received a return call. I went to another Dr to get a second opinion on what i could recall they told me. Something could have been seriously wrong with me and for a Dr's office not to return a call in a week 1/2 is unacceptable. Especially after you have already paid them. I really wanted Dr Garcia to deliver my child but I thinkI will look for another OBGYN who's staff actually return calls. Im scared that when I do become pregnant & have questions no one would return my calls. Good doctor but horrible staff & customer service skills.

Non-surgical remedies did not work, which meant surgery loomed on the horizon. My ob-gyn wasn’t experienced with cystocele (bladder protrusion) repair and recommended I find a board certified urogynecologist. There were none in my immediate area, but I found Drs Miklos and Moore in Atlanta. They had the education, certifications, and experience I was looking for.
Although I was terrified at the extent of surgery needed (cystocele repair, vaginal repair, and hysterectomy), it was easy to see everyone in the office really knew what they were doing. Dr. Moore does not use robotic surgery, as it really isn’t needed for this type of surgery. Further he feels the use of robotics doubles the time the patient is under anesthesia which presents its own set of concerns. From there we chatted about studies relating to the best techniques and materials – I had a lot of questions, and Dr. Moore was willing to spend for long as I needed.
Everyone in the office was great. Dr. Moore's staff helped me coordinate paperwork, insurance, office visits, and surgery. Danielle provided support as she responded within two hours to every email question I had. Prior to surgery, I needed to have a couple of bladder tests. This is when I met Dr. Hawkins. She was calming and efficient, and I was happy to learn both she and Dr. Moore were going to do the surgery together.
I was EXTREMELY nervous about the extent of the surgery, but the office was prepared for pre-op jitters and handled it well. After the surgery (hospital stay of 23 hours), I had 3 tiny incisions in my abdomen that were glued, not stitched. I was up and walking the halls a few hours later. I went home, and within three days, I did not even need pain meds. Now, 12 weeks later, I feel completely normal and suffered no complications. Even better, the surgery completely resolved my pelvic organ prolapse, and I’m able to resume my active life. I can’t thank Dr. Moore and Dr. Hawkins (and Danielle) enough. The experience and results surpassed my (and my husband’s) expectations.

I found Dr Moore via the Internet and I wrote him few questions on how to repair it in which he replied with miles of details. He gave me confidence that he's the doctor for me and thus I booked the surgery with him. As l lived in Hong Kong (China) I did not know what to do and where to stay in Atlanta, his staff arranged everything for me . So from Hong Hong to Atlanta my husband and I went for my surgery in Aug 2010. Dr Moore and his staff were wonderful and kind to us.

He seems to value patients that are nurses or doctors which would explain the positive comments from the nurses. I was just a lay person and of no significance in the eyes of Dr. Moore."

I had my first visit with him in January 09' after going from doctor to doctor to find the source of the continual pain that I had been in for a while. He spoke with me for about 30 minutes before the exam and then over an hour after the exam, explaining in detail what was going on with me. I'm 54 years old, and I've never been to a doctor that spent that amount of time talking to me! He wrote down my diagnosis and drew pictures and diagrams to show me what was going on. It turned out that I had multiple problems causing the pain. I had surgery in March, four weeks ago. I feel amazing already, and for the first time in a long time I have hope for the future, all because of Dr. Moore and his surgical expertise. I should also mention his office staff (all of them), who are amazing. They have returned every call, answered every (multiple)question, and have the best attitude of any office I've ever been to. I highly recommend this practice."

He helped me with a uterine mass; however, the ultrasound performed before the procedure also showed clear signs of ovarian cysts and signs of endometriosis. He did not discuss either of these with me, suggested I have a baby out of the blue without explaining, and when I requested to see my medical files, his staff refused to me and to a request from another medical facility I had begun to work with who were able to perform the necessary diagnoses and operations needed in addition to what Knoer performed and stopped at. His care fell short and left me seeking help from another doctor who listened to me and ended up performing emergency surgery, which would not have been necessary if Knoer had treated all of my disease and had been willing to communicate with me in a transparent, respectful manner, like by describing the disease and its effects on my organs rather than saying nothing and telling me to get pregnant, regardless of what I wanted."

I was overdue and induced (twice - the first time was unsuccessful so we started over the next day) and every doctor and nurse agreed on one thing: my baby was going to be big. I was really scared I would end up with a c-section, but Dr. Graham was incredibly patient and calm and gave my body the time it needed to have this baby as naturally as possible. I found out after I delivered that his wife used to be a midwife and he approaches delivery a little differently. My own doctor even said if any other doctor would have been on call that day, he would have performed a c-section rather than let me labor for so long. The best thing about my delivery was that after Dr. Graham delivered the head and shoulders, he let me pull her out the rest of the way. Not everyone would be into that, but I thought it was incredible. So glad to have had him deliver my sweet baby girl!
The one drawback is that this practice has about 10 doctors in 4 offices who all take turns at the hospital. The odds of having him deliver me next time are pretty low, especially if I go into labor spontaneously. "

I felt extremely rushed at every visit. I was complaining about bleeding (sporadically) and an ultrasound was done (no lab work) and I was told nothing was wrong but I should stay off my feet and check with Perinatal. Perinatal wanted to see me 3-4 weeks. At 23 weeks pregnant I started having contractions every 1-3 minutes. I called the office when I was in the hospital and was told by Dr Graham's nurse that he would call me, well here it is two weeks later, I never received a call from Dr Graham. I did not want to be made as an example so I decided it was best for the health of my baby and I to switch to another obstetrician. I didn't like feeling like a dollar amount or ticket number. Nice doctor if he had time for his patients. I think patient care should mean more than money. I've had too many incidents to mention."

He was always willing to answer my questions and offer guidance as I went through my pregnancy and prepared for motherhood. I never felt like just another patient.

I called the office with mild spotting and was seen the next day. Dr. Graham came from the hospital after he did a surgery to see me. He spent a lot of time with me and never made me feel rushed. He repeated every thing to my husband as soon as he arrived from out of town, so it was actually like two visits in one. He is also going to preform a D&C on his day off the day before Thanksgiving. How many other doctors do that. He is compassionate, smart and the nurses at Northside Hospital call him the midwife doctor. He delivered m first child and my husband and I were so surprised how calm the whole event was. I know women waited for him today because of me getting squeezed in. I won't forget that and I will never go to another OB. I will understand that if I wait, it is because he took the time to really talk to a patient that got bad news. He is a rare doctor."

I am pregnant and typically wait 45 minutes to an hour before actually seeing Dr. Graham. This was also the case when I had an emergency visit. I am able to see Dr. Graham on average about 7 minutes. Dr. Graham's nurse is always in a hurry and does not provide time to answer questions during visits. She shows you to your exam room, checks the baby's heartrate and leaves. There is no way to talk to an actual person when you call this office. You have to leave a message and wait by your phone for a nurse to call you back.

He brings you to his office and takes your medical history as you go along, and ask questions and get to know about you. Very easy to talk to and down to earth, before recommending anything he asks to make sure you are a good candidate for birth control options. Good sense of humor, and great personality.

I am actually on this site because I am in need of a new gyn and searched to see where she is now located.

I believe every woman should have a ""Dr.Sadler"" She is by far the best doctor I have ever had. As for the hospitals. Greater Laurel Hospital was great. Prince Georges was an awful experience.

I don't believe the posts on this site. Dr. Sadler is patient, kind and very respectful to her patients. She takes her time and explains everything she recommends in great detail. As for the previous poster-- Dr. Sadler doesn't drink coffee and never has. She frequently tells me to avoid caffeine and has told me that she doesn't drink it either.

I won't even use the term ""Dr"" when referring to this beast. Sadler is the worst excuse for a doctor I've ever encountered. PAY ATTENTION TO THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS. THEY ARE TRUE. This woman is mean, arrogant and plain rude. Maybe she's just been doing it too long and she's burned out, but you don't deserve to pay the price for her frustration with the medical field. Plain and simple avoid Cynthia Sadler at all costs. She has horrible bedside manner, she is not educated nor up on current trends and treatments, and she's extremely rude. As in, she'll fight with you. She's extremely unprofessional. I obviously cannot say enough BAD things about this woman. Just stay away. The fact that she's an OBGYN and she's worked at Cash Only/Pain Management/Pill Mill type operations should speak volumes."

When I came to her I had 4 miscarriages. Other Doctors gave up on me . Then a co-worker recommended Dr. Salder. She was the only Doctor that took the time to find out what was causing my miscarriages and get me through a full pregnancy. Dr Sadler called at my home to make sure that I was following her instruction when it got near the time that I would usually Lose the baby. Dr. Sadler took care of me Like I was a family memeber. The service she provided me was impeccable. At one time when my insurance didn't cover me(because I was put on bedrest) I had to get the state help. Dr Sadler filled out the paper to accept DC State insurance so she could continue treating me. I wish that I could still be a patient of Dr. Sadler If she was still in practice.

If you have plenty of time to sit around and waste to wait to see her for 5 minutes then go for it. She was my OBGYN for 20 years, but I had to drop her and get another OBGYN because I got tired of scheduling my doctors appointment for one time and not seeing her until 2 hours AFTER my scheduled time. It stressed me out too much. They used to have you call in for your test results, now they have you come in and pay yet another fee just to get your test results.

He was kind, attentive and really asked me questions to determine the right path for my treatment. I felt like my needs and wants were considered 100% in addition to his medical opinion. I asked about having another procedure done at the same time and during my consult, he picked up his cell phone and consulted with the other specialist to see if it was possible. He held my hand going into surgery and then asked if I'd like for him to pray with me! I can't tell you how much that eased my fears.

When you leave his office you feel like someone really listened, cares about you and gives you direction. You don't leave with only a prescription. He is the best. I recommend him to anyone looking for a good, kind, concerned, intelligent, physician who keeps up with the latest techniques which will benefit his clientele.

I have known him for 22+ years. He is knowledgeable and passionate about the services he offers women and I think he is the best at what he does. I 100% and wholeheartedly recommend him to any woman looking for a knowledgeable and dedicated doctor who treats his patients with the individual care that will leave you feeling like you are his only patient.

Ulbrich,Atlanta,Georgia, Gynecologists (OBGYN) , Male,35,3.72,2014-12-31T14:08:17.613Z,4,4,3,4,5,I went through several doctors and battled infertility for six years before being recommended to Dr. Ulbrich. I was in the delivery room when he delivered my nephew. It was then he suggested I come see him about my infertility issues. He found something that the other doctors had not discovered. I was pregnant thirty days after my first visit with Dr. Ulbrich. I had a planned c-section (medically necessary). I must say I was very impressed with my delivery and my recovery. I agree he can be blunt at times but he is an amazing doctor.

My birthing experience was so easy. It wasn't my ""birth plan"" but I am so glad he offered his advice and his suggestions. He has delivered many babies and knew a lot more than I did! So everything he suggested was to make giving birth as easy as possible for me and my baby. I appreciated that so much. When I got pregnant with my second child in 2012, he was the doctor I wanted and I was crushed to learn he no longer was doing obstetrics. My birthing experience with my second child was awful. Dr. Ulbrich definitely knew what he was doing. With my second child I had such a horrible experience with my doctors. They started pushing for a c-section before I even finished dilating and didn't listen to me when I tried explaining what I was feeling. I did have a c section, but I truly believe Dr. Ulbrich never would have let that happen. He was the BEST!!"

He has a couple of offices, but can be found in Peachtree City, GA at Cosmedical Spa at 401 GA Hwy 74, North
I arrived slightly early for my appointment and did not have to wait. He's changed his practice somewhat and no longer participates in Obstetrics (Prenatal care/Childbirth), but will see you for Gynecological services."

Based on the aggressive nature of the posts I would imagine his suspension was initiated by someone with a personal vendetta. It is a shame that our community, for a time lost such a truly gifted physician. He delivered all three of my children, high risks pregnancies and they were all amazing deliveries. As another person stated, almost timed to the minute. I have heard numerous other physician’s comment on his excellent surgical skills, one even saying ‘he has the best hands of any surgeon I’ve operated with’. As someone who had access to statistical outcomes at Piedmont Hospital, Dr. Ulbrich consistently had the lowest C-Section rates, the highest successful VBAC rates (vaginal birth’s after previous C-Section) and lowest surgical complication rates. Yes, he does practice progressive medicine. If you are looking for a holistic, natural, birth he may not be the physician for you."

He spent almost an hour talking to me about my issues.Some may comment about some foolishness that happened early in his career that was proven to be false and he was cleared. How do I know. Because I have been his patient since 2007 and know the entire history. People hate because he is successful and patients prefer his office over theirs. If you want a doctor who will trult care about your health and will treat you like you are the only patient, then Dr. Edmonds is for you. My sister and friends all go to Dr. Edmonds and they all feel the same way, My mother that lives in Jamaica flys in once a year to see Dr. Edmonds. I wrote this post after I told a coworker about him and see tols me about a review that was damaging to Dr. Edmonds. Stop you juvenile assault against a great doctor."

Straightforward and to the point, great clinical knowledge, good advice. I will say that he is strictly allopathic-- if you are into the natural stuff, he is not very supportive of that.

He spends the time to make sure you are comfortable and have all your questions answered, and he goes beyond the call to communicate outside of office hours. A gem of a doc."

She pushed Depo Provera on me at my LAST visit. Not for birth control and for no real medical reason. I was never given any information about the injection or possible side effects. Ever since three days days after receiving this poison every muscle from my waist down has been in excruciating pain. It's been NINE months now! Her decision to push this unnecessary poison on me has destroyed my life and the lives of my family. STAY FAR AWAY if you cherish your health!

She preformed a routine biopsy during what happened to be ""that time of the month"" for me. She was determined that my NORMAL period was too heavy and she would get the bleeding under control. Unfortunately I made the mistake of trusting her to have my best interest in mind. Definitely not the case. She injected me with the poison Depo Provera, never bothered to mention any of the possible side effects, or that it would linger in my body for 6+ months, or most importantly that there was no way to counter act it. I have been in excruciating pain in every muscle from the waist down (for over five months now) have lost half my hair and bleed for 6 weeks at a time! I called her office when the pain began and she had the gull to tell me that it wasn't caused by the shot. Funny I was perfectly healthy three days before!"

I have read other peoples views as well, and if your having a money issue you might want to check your insurance provider, I had to put down a 50.00 deposit that was refunded before we left. It was complete covered by UHC. Also I got a same day appointed which was awesome seeing that my regular physician wasn't able to do her job and answer questions that I had during my visit. Did I mention that I was a new patient, and I only sat down for 5 min before being called to the back. All my questions were answered, I wasn't rushed, the staff was very friendly and helpful.

Her presentation on the surface is polished. The appointment always starts by meeting with her before getting into ""the robe."" But she doesn't listen carefully. I started crying out of the blue during an exam when she asked how I was feeling. I never cry in front of family or friends, so I surprised myself. Dr. Arkin just stood and held a kleenex box while I cried. Then she told me to call her in about 2 months if I still felt ""down"". That was it. A year later I returned for an exam,and she found a huge goiter. She referred me to her husband to have a biopsy. (THAT was a very scary appointment.) But my new doctor I learned that I have hypothyroidism. The crying a year later (depression) and early menopause are obvious symptoms. Dr. Arkin completely missed it. My new gynocologist said that Dr. Arkin should have helped diagnose this, & early menopause could have been stopped with synthroid. Plus she pushes estrogen in multiple forms."

She has a nurturing mother like quality that is very comforting. This goes along well with Dr. Suarez's philosophy as well! I am pregnant with my 4th child and have no doubt our birth experience will be amazing. I recently experienced an issue with an abnormal pap smear. Dr. Suarez helped me through this tough time by giving me all the facts. After my biopsy when he knew I was scared to death he was very understanding and comforting as well. The results came back negative and he and his nurse called me as soon as they received the tests. I would recommend him to anyone!

I was referred to her after my prior GYN missed the fibroids and the NP discovered them. Dr. Walters was very thorough. I decided to remain with her as my GYN. The prior reviews are accurate.
The receptionist is always warm and welcoming (Dunwoody Office), the nurses are hit and miss. Dr. Walters, blows in and out of the room like the wind. If you do not ask her directed questions, she WILL NOT take the time to discuss and will be out of the room before you can blink. I once arrived and was informed she left for the day. I requested Dr Paglione (sp?) because I left work and drove in traffic for the appointment. I LOVE Dr. Paglione (the two times Ive seen her). She is very thorough, offers additional tests to check ""Everything"" and spends the time with the patient. She knows about you as a patient (reads your chart) before walking into the room, unlike Dr Walters. Dr. Walters is very knowledgeable (without a doubt) but she falls short on so many other fronts.

The past few visits have been very rushed , she doesn't read the chart and assumes things that she could have read in the chart. She doesn't listen to concerns and is very dismissive to the point that it is rude. I decided maybe she was having a bad day and came back for another visit, she was offensive, judgemental, and dismissive.One of the worst healthcare provider visits i've ever had. The quality of her work has definitely decreased since the fame and there are way better OBGYNs in the area. "

She had a heart to heart with me and now my husband, that caused me to consider it. It's now 2014, and I'm proud to say that we are the proud parents of 8.......yes 8 (5 boys and 3 girls) beautiful children. I never thought I would be here, and would like to share in the excitement with Dr. Jackie.

Unlike most doctors, when she has bad news to deliver she does not beat around the bush or sugarcoat a situation with unnecessary pleasantries. She has seen me through several serious health issues over the years and several instances when I worried unnecessarily. Even in times where I had to page her after hours, she never expressed frustration, but always showed patience and reassurance. And ultimately, she always finds the right course of treatment. I trust her judgment completely - she is an absolutely wonderful doctor and wonderful person. Also, by the way parking is now only $3 and the waiting room time has been substantially shortened.

I've stuck with her for 5 years due to her knowledge, but am tired of spending a hour in the waiting room everytime I have an appointment. Everything, including the charts are electronic, which is nice. However, one day it all went down and I waited 2.5 hours to be seen. Another time, I waited over an hour and was told it would be another half hour or more before I would be seen, so I rescheduled. You have to park in a pay by 20 minutes parking deck and the stub the receptionist gave me to cover parking, didn't even cover it. Overall, good doctor, bad scheduling."

At first I trusted him based on the recommendation of a friend and his impressive credentials, but I now trust him because of the radical change that his skills in extracting endometriosis have made in my quality of life. He also suspected a serious hormonal imbalance and helped me to get life-changing care with a skilled endocrinologist, and he has been relentless in advising me on nutritional habits that would improve my treatment outcomes. He has his own ultrasound and hysteroscopy equipment, which is not only convenient but also has led to better outcomes since the procedure is conducted by him personally (as he is much more knowledgeable in guiding and interpreting the images). His office and insurance/billing staff have always been professional and helpful and his lead nurse is fantastic. I feel like Dr. Nezhat and his leading staff members know me and care about me. The wait is sometimes long, but I know it's because he is taking extra time when needed to meet the needs of other patients, as he has done with me on multiple occasions, so I don't mind. I am not wealthy, but I drive 16 round-trip hours or fly to Atlanta 1-3 times per year to see him, and I will continue to do so as long as I can because I believe I get the best possible care with Dr. Nezhat."

I was in labor and in the car to the hospital going to deliver my son vaginal breech with Dr. Tate at Emory Midtown Hospital. I transitioned through labor so quickly that Dr. Tate was not called in time to get there when I arrived, with baby's feet literally coming out while I was in the wheelchair on the way up to the delivery room. Dr. Horton has been trained in vaginal breech delivery and did not break a sweat when I presented in almost a state of shock! He helped deliver my footling breech baby boy healthy and strong, and I am blessed that he was standing outside the door of my L&D room. My son came 3 minutes after arriving to the hospital! If not for Dr.'s like Dr. Horton, who take the time to train in breech vaginal delivery...baby's like mine may have a very different outcome. Breech is usually an automatic cesarean largely due to inexperience of the OB in delivering them. Thank you Dr. Horton for being there for us!"

I unfortunately had 2 tests performed at the hospital. A Ct scan and an ultrasound. the ultrasound showed I had a large cyst but the CT did not. His office only had a copy of my CT. he proceeded to read my CT to me twice when I complained of pain and nausea these tests were also 2 weeks old so who knows how my cyst had progressed since then. all I knew was that I could feel it when I breathed and I had been laying with a heating pad every night. he did not treat me it seems because he had no proof of a cyst. I was in tears because of the pain and hopelessness I was feeling. if only I had the to show him. shame on this doctor for needing proof of pain and discomfort. I went to the hospital today and have my ultrasound in my hands. I plan on going to another obgyn on monday. I have never been treated this way by a doctor. it seemed as if he was more intested in getting home for the day then treating his patients.

She is attentive, knowledgeable, and has incredible bedside manner. You can tell she really cares about her patients and makes sure her staff cares about them, too. They are a courteous and helpful bunch, especially the ultrasound tech ""IShine"". I'm really, really opinionated about doctors because any kind of exam, no matter how non-invasive, really makes me nervous. Dr. Siegel puts you at ease instantly, she's nice, and she is a great listener. You won't find a better OB/GYN in Atlanta. The only reason the office got a 3 rating on punctuality is that I waited for an hour today for my appointment, which is rare.

Dr. Dawson is the most caring, involved OB/GYN I've ever been to. I actually enjoy or visits, and feel like he genuinely cares about his patients. Not only is he knowledgeable, he's very kind and easy to talk to. He makes sure to answer all your questions and leave you feeling well taken care of. He is almost always right on time and never rushes your appointment. His staff is helpful both in the office and when you need to call in about questions. No question is ""too stupid"" and they are prompt in their answers. They also have a wonderful online service that allows you to view all your medical records and test results. The only downfall is that the billing office is not very compassionate or willing to make payment arrangements. That being said, I once owed a lot of money but had an emergency situation and Dr. Dawson was kind enough to override them and allow me to come in regardless.

He had an emergency but came out between appts to personally k give me a choice to wait or reschedule. I waited and received a thorough exam. He asks questions and seems very concerned about his patients. Its hard to find a good doc in atlanta where you dont feel like cattle in a herd. Plus he is from my home state which added to my comfort level. His staff is wonderful and his office is clean and elegantly tasteful. Im glad I found him.

He does not listen to you when you talk he will cut you off mid sentence and he is too focus (to where he fades you out. He is knowledgable but he is also not up to par with the lastest techinques in medicine. Overall I give him 2 out of 5. I will not be returning as a patient. He is not what I am looking for in a MD."

Though I was her patient for several years, she did not ever tell me I had had fibroids (her nurse practitioner mentioned it in passing when it appeared I might have ovarian cancer). This doctor responded to my reservations about the surgery she wanted to perform with this statement : ""You'll never have children with THAT uterus."" She yelled this at me in the billing hallway of her office, where the office staff could hear her and while she was handing my chart to her billing clerk. What a cold and hostile doctor. When I asked her staff for a copy of my medical records, they said, ""no."" It took one month, and persisting despite rude office staff, to get my records. This doctor negatively affected my health."

If you want an honest and upfront doctor, she's it. She doesn't sugar coat the conversation or brush you off to being ""hormonal"". She is the only doctor I trusted to do more than one and major surgeries. I have received excellent care and advice from her every time I visit. I have had to wait a long time occasionally but she is worth it. She keeps up to date with new studies and discoveries. She is easy to talk to about uncomfortable topics and always offers suggestions or just listens. She watched out for me when I was in the hospital for a hysterectomy and responded quickly when I needed her. If she wasn't available on the weekends afterwards, she has a great group of doctors that were there for me and responded quickly as well. I now drive a long way just to see Dr. Croft. I won't be changing doctors unless she retires one day. She is great in my eyes!"

She is blunt, but in a friendly way. She has diagnosed several issues with me and was correct each time, as evidenced by quick successful treatment. She was able to diagnose something my internist could not. She is open and will answer any question, no matter how personal, with frank response and no judgement. I like her and would recommend her to anyone."

The second time I was having severe pelvic pain. She did a quick (less than a minute) exam and ordered an ultrasound. She left town with no direction other than everything was normal. She didn’t recommend any course of action or any other doctor; she left me to fend for myself and determine where to go on my own. Within the next several days I was in extreme pain and bleeding. She has a horrible bedside manner, was rude and condescending both times I saw her, has an attitude of superiority and seems to enjoy flaunting it. I will never go back to her or be treated in such a disrespectful manner. If you are looking for a caring, compassionate doctor who will work with you to solve the problem or refer you to a competent doctor, then I cannot recommend Dr. Croft."

I went for a birth control consultation, and when discussing my options Dr. Soorena Fatehchehr made some interesting comments. I was on a birth control a few years ago and it had some major negative psychological effects on me, and when I told him of this he told me ""all 15 year olds are suicidal."" Further into the conversation he stated that the pill may make you gain weight, and that he tells his patients to ""just eat salad every time they're hungry."" He REALLY pushes the pill, and is unopen to discussion about ANY other option. According to the Resident Bios at OU.EDU he graduated from medical school in Tehran, Iran."

Due to the office negligence we have had to come out of pocket $1500 for expenses that were undue and did not go toward deductibles for our plan or costs of birth. We had not information provided for diet, medical needs or assistance for gestational diabetes even when we asked for it.
Dr. Blank was lovely and gracious despite his lack of awareness of his own office, staff and our diabetic needs for monitoring and referrals for a specialist. We switched doctors to receive better care by another staff and found peace of mind in the care of someone else. All in all it was a terrible experience with a rude and Ill equipt staff. "

I have spontaneous health issues that like to pop up without any warning. In the past this has left me to finding a clinic somewhere that will take me or worst case scenario, going to the ER for a prescription.

He delivered my second son about three years ago, via c-section. Four weeks after having my son, I learned I had a DVT and a pulmonary embolism. Having to go back to the hospital after trying to recover from my c-section, I notified Dr. Blank, since I felt I was still under his care. As well learning that I had this misfortune from the c-section. He never came to check on me, nor call to see how I was. Rather he waited to see me weeks later at my check up. He seemed more worried about himself, then my well being. I remind you that my first son's delivery was perfect. Not happy, nor ever going back!!!"

He is just the most caring, personable and professional doctor I've ever met! There have been times when I was worred about something and had to call him at night. He always makes me feel that my concerns are valid, puts my mind to rest - or if he feels I need immediate attention either meets me at the ER if it's at night or tells me to call the office first thing in the morning to make an appt - whenever I call, his staff already knows to expect my call and has an appointment waiting for me. Also, if I am seen for a problem, Dr Blank always calls me the next day to see how I am doing - and this is on weekends too!

I really like her and felt the care throughout my pregnancy through my delivery and follow up was excellent. My husband and I both asked a LOT of questions during our appointments and she always took the time to answer all our questions thoroughly. I have been seen by all the doctors in the practice at least once, a couple times for very scary/upsetting reasons, and have been very impressed by each of their professionalism and compassion. I highly recommend this practice to friends regularly."

I have seen her for several years and have always found her to be kind and caring and knowledgeable. She did an endometrial ablation on me and I was very nervous ahead of time and she explained the procedure thoroughly, what my other options were, etc. I wish there were more doctors like her out there. Most of them seem to see their patients as a bother. Not Dr. Adams. Any time I've left a message for her to call because I have had a question (which is not often) she has returned my call and answered my question."

She's totally down to earth, practices ""better safe than sorry"" medicine and very knowledgeable. She is very comforting and doesn't rush thru the appointment like some doctors do.

Dr. Adams interacted with me like the entire time she spent in medical school (and you know where she went right?) she has never heard of Endometriosis or Interstitial Cystitis. Actually, this woman had me convinced that those two very common conditions were foreign to her. She made comments such as""some people do have very painful periods and that is normal"" and ""there's no point in looking into this further because I don't see anything wrong with you"" when clearly I exibited symptoms of someone in distress. Someone mentioned earlier and that review was deleted that her hick accent is annoying but in all honesty, the accent can get under your skin if you're already frustrated. Not recommended."

I came to her for a complicated Gyn problem after seeing several other gynecologists that I was disappointed with. Dr. Adams was extremely helpful, compassionate, and knowledgeable. She took a lot of time with me and had a very comforting,caring bedside manner. She has always gotten back to me with results or follow up right away. I think she is terrific and I am extremely grateful for all she has done for me. I have sent my sister, my mother, and one of my good friends to her. They all think she is fabulous and feel she gives them excellent care and a lot of attention. Therefore, I could not believe it when I saw that someone wrote something negative about Dr. Adams. All the patients that she sees that I know love her and are so glad to have found her. I recommend her highly and without any reservations."

Adams,Atlanta,Georgia, Gynecologists (OBGYN) , Female,11,4.19,2006-08-17T09:28:29Z,4.7,,4,5,5,It is sad to see that Dr. Adams is being judged on her expertise because she merely did not regurgitate the bombastic advice from google... Doctors are not there to teach you the process of inflammation and its consequences in a particular ailment in one session (which took them several years to learn during medical school;) they have to think about all the possible 'safe' treatments before giving a solid advice. And rating a doc by her accent is preposterous. I would much rather go to a doctor who is knowledgable than someone who is elquent but lacks proper diagnosis. My experience with Dr. Adams before and after my pregnancy was nothing short of magnificent. She went out of her way to find out in detail what topical creams I could or could not continue to use during pregnancy (my dermatologist had cautioned against all use and I was extremely uncomfortable.)

Adams,Atlanta,Georgia, Gynecologists (OBGYN) , Female,11,4.19,2006-02-27T20:59:43Z,1,,1,1,1,"I agree that accents are not important here because having a Southern accent doesn't make you less qualified as a doctor. Unfortunately in Dr. Adam's case, it doesn't help either. My first visit with her was dissapointing and I don't think I'm going back to that office again. First of all, she was 45 minutes late and the front desk just kept saying that ""she's been running behind all day"", which didn't exactly make me feel any better. It just means that I wasn't the only one that day that had to wait endlessly to be seen for 10 minutes. Here's the worst part, when finally seen, Dr. Adams did not apologize for keeping me waiting for almost an hour. Talk about bad first impression. I also felt very rushed through out the whole process. I expected to talk in her office for at least 10 minutes since I was a new patient but she wasn't interested in me, just asked some very basic queestions, such as if I'm on birth control, etc. I agree that she wasn't warm and fuzzy. Just sort of impersonal."

We will work together to find the problem."" He worked, and did find the problem...Endometriosis! For years, I suffered because I had a Dr. that didn't believe my pain. I found Dr. Gumer, and everything changed for me. He is awesome! You won't go wrong with Dr. Gumer!!"

As the signs in the office explain, these doctors run on baby time, so on occasion I had to wait longer while Dr. Creed was dashing between the office and neighboring Northside Hospital. However, my overall experience as a first time mom who had to have a medically necessary c-section was exceptional. Dr. Creed was professional, knowledgable, and a brilliant surgeon.

One thing I am very happy with is that she doesn't rush appointments and spends the time to make sure you understand options.

If you have alot of problems, or are high risk, and have to call the nurse or her often, or have to come in and get checked, she has an attitude. Like it's your fault, or you are bothering her. Her nurse Danielle is the same way, the more they have to deal with you, the more of an attitude they have with you. The problems I have had are excessive bleeding, high blood pressure,etc. Aren't you supposed to call when these issues arise?? it's to the point now when the nurse calls me back she doesn't say a word to me, she runs me into the room, takes my blood pressure and leaves. when Karen comes in, she talks really fast runs through her ""check list"" of questions,and says I will see you in 4 weeks. the last visit I timed was 45 secs. The other issue I have with her is when I told her I was having heart palpitations, blurred vision, and dizzy spells she told me to go home and drink water. looking for a new dr"

I am 32 weeks pregnant with my second baby and have a low risk pregnancy. I have been receiving all prenatal care and a labor and delivery nurse myself. Decided to switch to his practice because heard good things about him and wanted to deliver at northside where my current provider didn't deliver there. Anyway, called to schedule an appointment and was greeted over the phone by a very rude receptionist, who when found out that I am 32 weeks, said she needed to go talk to the doc. I very nicely explained to her that I have all prenatal care and low risk pregnancy. She came back after talking to the doc and said he doesn't accept patients after 30 weeks, what????? Liability, what???? Can you read charts and records from before? Sounded like a crazy discrimination to me , but she said it is his policy. Pretty upsetting to me- what a waist of time

I was taken to his office and waited about 30 min for him to even come in. Once we started talking I quickly realized that he is very arrogant and dismissive. There is a difference between being blunt and being completely presumptuous and superficial. Everything I said, he countered with IVF at ACRM (fertility clinic), even though nothing about my prior medical history even hinted that we wouldn't be able to conceive on our own. He was selling them REALLY hard, it almost felt like he worked for them not his own practice. I left there swearing I would never return. I found another doctor who takes his time and does not unnecessarily freak healthy people out with an irrelevant doom and gloom attitude. Most reviews are from pregnant people so maybe he is better with them but thank god I won't ever return to find out. Stay away, horrid bedside manner."

I wanted to know out my body and having children and she was more focused on my situation with my mate. I didn’t feel comfortable, safe or like ne one really cared about me (everyone seems robotic, like they were just at work and really didn’t want to be there). I wasn’t impress with the location (kind of looked like a jail from the outside) but inside it was nice and clean.

You will not feel rushed and his staff is great too! He is excellent and his location is far for me but well worth the drive to know I am in such great hands. He is always referencing the latest studies which is quite refreshing since most docs tend to not keep up on all the latest studies out there. He is funny too. A great experience.

Dr. Harley has been my physician since 2005, as a OBGYN from my insurance plan. I was her first patient for bio-identical hormones. Walked into her office with a Susan Summers book and she had just attended a convention for medial doctors on the same topic! Very synchronistic in all ways! Love her office and staff!"

In the beginning, the wait was long, however, what I learned was that she took the time to talk to her patients, including me. I just took a book to read and time went by pretty quickly. I don't mind waiting because Dr. Harley took care of my menopausal issues and is extremely knowledgeable on the subject."

Supplements are very expensive. Pellets at times does not work! Can't get a call back. Can't furnish a bill at time of service, they want cash payments.

So I made an appt. I asked very specific questions prior to making the appt and then the day came. I left work early and arrived early since I was a new patient. When I got to the office, it looked old, moldy and out-dated, but I proceeded to sign in. I was given a form to fill out as a new patient. After waiting over an hour, I went back to the front desk. Shortly I was called to the back. After speaking to the docotor, they told me that they don't accept high risk patients. As I was being dismissed, with no services complete, I began to ask more probing questions. That doctor then told me to wait while she consulted with the other doctors. The end result was, after the practice discussed my condition, then would not be able to see me as a patient. What a waste. I will never go back there or refer anyone to them. If I so much as here her name I am disgusted."

I experienced CHRONIC INSOMNIA due to perimenopause and it took 3 months to find Dr. Harley. After being told by other doctors that I was depressed and throwing pharmaceutical drugs at me, I found this practice to be professional and expert at hormone therapy using bioidentical hormones. Dr. Harley and staff listened to my symptoms and immediately began to balance me. I started with her in December, 2009 and I would say I am 85% July, 2010)and looking forward to getting my LIFE back! They are the BEST in Atlanta. All gynecologists DO NOT know hormones! Dr. Harley and staff are experts!"

She is very knowledgeable and has superb bedside manner. She delivered my 2 daughters-both on her days off because I specifically wanted her. The staff have always been extremely friendly and helpful to me. She is one of the few ob/gyn's who takes interest in women's health AFTER childbearing years and educates you on what to expect and how to prepare for menopause. My overall health has improved because of Dr. Harley and although her office punctuality is very poor, I find her well worth the wait."

I had a hysterectomy performed may 2004. She did a partial and never ruled out endometriosis since i was having pain and bleeding. After misdiagnosing me, her and her staff began to treat me bad then told me she no longer accepted my insurance. i went years in pain to find out i had a endometrioma that blocked my ureter and killed my right kidney. Now the endometriosis is on the only kidney I have left and all I see in the future is my dealth and to leave my 5 children unsupported. She IS WALKING AROUND HAPPY AND PAID FROM HER MILLIONS OF SURGERIES. I JUST WISHED SHE CARED ENOUGH ABOUT ME AND MY FAMILY TO AT LEAST SAY ""I'M SORRY.My kids don't have a future without a mother.

I just wish her office ran as well. Her staff are nice people but they miss follow-up calls and somehow instructions from the doctor don't always get done. Her office needs a good cleaning both in the waiting areas and the exam rooms (dust, unmopped floors). And the wait is horrendous! I have watched entire tv shows in the lobby (before they took the TV out in favor of a looped video for their skin care services) and taken naps in the exam rooms -- both on a regular basis. I believe the doctor is overbooked and often seems tired when she comes to the exam and sometimes does not take the time to listen or assumes things. Maybe the latter is because she's been doing this for a long time but it does nothing to help with communication. Again, I appreciate her work in the operation room but I can do without everything else."

He immediately addressed my endometriosis pain and constant bleeding. His office nurse, Cheryl Spencer was SO SWEET, I loved her! Surgery was scheduled and everything went well. I felt great and had no issues for about 2 years. After that, I experienced constant bleeding. I visited his office NUMEROUS times with the same complaints. He prescribed me medication that didn't help, said that perhaps my Mirena was causing bleeding my irritating the walls of my uterus (although I had already had it for many years without that ever being an issue) and then told me ""well, you can either not be in pain or you can bleed. It will never be both apparently."" Being a 25 year old woman, constant pain and bleeding was devastating to my active lifestyle. Eventually, I did my research and found a doctor that directly addressed and fixed all of my issues with another surgery. He even diagnosed me with Adenomyosis, something Lyons never even suggested.
While I think he is a great doctor, I am really disappointed with how dismissive he became. He made me feel like I was an annoyance and that I would forever have to live my life with these issues.
If you are in suffering from any gynecological issues, PLEASE check out Dr. Ken Sinervo! He is right next door to Dr. Lyons and totally changed my life!"

I am ill and have to see many doctors, he is the only one I feel comfortable with. He listens to my concerns even if it isn't OB related. He works with ALL my other doctors to make sure everyone is on the same page. He makes himself available to me for emergency. I wouldn't change him for anything. He saved my babies life when the Emergency Room want to give me a DNC. They told me I miscarried and I signed all the papers to basically have an abortion.

As for the receptionist, she didn't seem too thrill to be at her job this particular day and neither were any of the other office personel members. This was a routine annual check and I must say the doctor was very friendly and maybe a little too friendly. He asked questions that were not necessarily concerning my medical needs, and he did a lot of complimenting (He commented on everything from my hairstyle to my panty hose). Considering what a gynecologist does, this made me very uncomfortable. Unless you're looking for a date or a cheap thrill, find yourself a REAL doctor - one with good bedside MANNERS."

I was a little concerned since the doctor I went to the previous year did not recommend it as well (I relocated for a year for my job). I let him do the procedure and it was the worst experience I have had yet. He also recommended that I come back in six months and have this procedure again which I did not. This year I was concerned about having my annual. I decided to go to another doctor since I questioned Dr. Ehrlich recommendation the previous year. I shared my concern and showed him my records. He reviewed the records and said that I would not need another colposcopy unless the count was higher. He said that he would not have done the first one.

(Perhaps they are just cautious since 80% of patients are pregnant, on/off pill and going through change too many hormones to deal with). I arrived 15 min early, and was taken back to start process immediatly. Its almost a factory, 4 triage booths where you get your BP, history, urine sample, iron check. Then you go to a back waiting area while Dr looks at your records. Then a small exam room for actual exam, less than 10 min with Dr. but no concerns to talk about so OK. It is very slick and efficient, not a lot of chit chat and hand holding, but adequate. I will stay with that practice. They get you through the process in record time. If you would rather be seen on time and get in and out, this is the Doc for you. Also they have most equipment required...Bone density screener, sonography equip, perform urine & blood test on premisis."

I liked his personality, liked his directness & felt like he was not rushing me and wanted to make sure I had all my questions answered. A lot of times when you are going thru the prenatal visits & rotating thru the practice, all the doc wants to do is check you off the list, listen to the heartbeat & move you along. That is absolutely not the case with Dr. Bodner. If I can't have my usual OB/GYN for my next delivery, I would happily have Dr. Bodner deliver my child. I don't know why there are negative reviews on him...he's great."

Also delivered my 2 other children. I trust him more than any doctor I see, have referred him to friends and wish he could be my doctor for everything!

I always complained about pelvic pain, but medications usually worked. The pain was getting worse, so I was calling him more. He told me I only wanted to have my belly cut open. He did not feel anything was wrong and he told me all women are hypochondriacs. Ultimately, I switched MDs and it was later found I had severe (Stage IV) Endometriosis! I also had a family history of Endo, so he should have listened more carefully to what I was saying. Further, if he feels all women are hypochondriacs, then he needs to find another area of practice! I partially blame myself for taking so long to be diagnosed because I stayed under his care. I found a GYN who cared enough to help me and BELIEVE me!"

First of all, even if you get an appointment you may not be able to see this clown. He is a good clown but not a doctor. My wife was in serious pain, and we kept calling his office. Finally, the guy calls back and says there is nothing he can do about it. Late in the night, I had to rush my wife to ER. Keep away from this clown."

I was a high risk pregnant with polyhydromnia, he always said everything is fine, until I lost my baby in my six month of pregnancy. After 6 month I was ready to try to get pregnant again. I start having a cyst with a lot of pain, they ultrasound me three times for three month having pain, he still said everything is fine! Since I lost my right ovary three years ago, I can't afford to loose another one Ame this new cyst is a big concern for me. Last Sunday I had to go to emergency room because of a bad pain and they called his office. Nobody called me on Monday so I had to call the nurse for follow up. She said I have to send my ER lab and ultrasound results for them to review! I wanted to seethe Dr and follow up with him, so I personally went to the office and took my results with me. The nurse wasn't available so I talked to the supervisor. She promised the nurse is going to contact me by the end of the day, but she never did! I had another pain episode that night, it was so bad that I was about to go to ER again. I prefer to see the Dr next day. I walked in to the office Wednesday morning saw the supervisor again. She said I cannot see the Dr and my nurse is going to call them. I was so angry, nobody cares what is going on. I have a cyst, I have pain, I have one ovary left and I am trying to get pregnant, but I feel I am being ignored and they don't care. I decided to change my dr and I even told the supervisor. She said I should get a call from either the nurse or herself anyway. I recieved the call with the funniest message from my nurse! She said Dr Garcia reaviued my results and base on the info I have to have another ultra sound in 6-8 weeks. That mean I can't able to read the last page of my results my self, and also means he didn't bothered himself to see what is going on with me, and I need to suffer with this pain for another 6-8 month. What a waist of time, even a first grade kid could read that part and tell the same thing to me!"

This doctor will say all you like to hear during your obstetrical office visits and then leaves it to the nurse to deliver your baby, not even showing up after their repeated calls. If you have never heard of fecal incontinence as I was, read up about it and then ask Dr. Garcia how many of his patients have ended up with it. Take this doctor’s dismissing attitude and harsh examinations as a warning and do not leave yourself and your precious baby into his reckless hands."

I had to have an emergency cesarean section, and he was joking while I was on the table ""I've done so many of these today you'd think I could do it with my eyes clothes."" I did nothing strenuous and two weeks later I was back in the hospital fighting an enormous infection in my abdomen because my incision had opened. When I went to Dr. Garcia-Saul before the hospital, he simply put a band-aid on it and said it was nothing to worry about. Next day I was having a seizure from a 104 degree fever and had to be rushed to the ER. This doctor is incompetent and irresponsible. I would highly recommend nobody uses him as their OBGYN."

I had been suffering with pelvic and bladder prolapse for over a year. I finally feel like I have gotten my life back. I did my research before selecting a surgeon. She was highly reccommended by my gynecology group and other physicians with whom I confer. I am a pharmacist myself and know that there are questionable physicians that practice. On my recent annual exam my gynecologist informed me that my results from my surgery were excellent. I just wanted to thank Dr. Wiskind and the Piedmont Hospital staff for the exceptional care I was given before, during and after my surgery.

When she couldn't provide a detailed explanation other than she hadn't deceided yet what procedures I was going to undergo in surgery, I cancelled the surgery and went to another doctor. She was quite smug and unfriendly. I have serious doubts concerning her skill level. I'm glad I went to another surgeon who had a plan. My billing stayed in a mess. Her staff was unhelpful.

My sling surgery was done incorrectly, it was not tight enough. She did not test it because I had a general anesthetic which you should NEVER have with this surgery.

I have experienced the opposite of what some of the peoople are talking about here. I have found her to be extremely warm and easy to communite with. Not many doctors will actually take the time to sit with you in their office AFTER your annual exam and go over everything, take the time to answer any questions you have, etc. She also introduced me to bio-identical hormones for post-menopausal symptoms before many of my friends' doctors even knew about them. She is very professional and business-like, perhaps that is what people are mistaking for being condescending, but I've never gotten that feeling from her--and believe me, I'm the kind of patient who asks lots of questions at times and could drive a doctor a little crazy! I would highly, highly recommend her. Her staff have always been extremely helpful as well."

When I found I needed a hysterectomy, I traveled to see her for a second opinion. She took the time to discuss various options with me, even though I was technically no longer her patient. I ended up choosing to have the surgery done by her in Atlanta because my insurance covered it, and it was one of the very best decisions of my life! Unlike what I was advised in Birmingham, Dr. Kleiss was able to do the surgery noninvasively and did not insist on removing my ovaries. I literally experienced no pain after the surgery in the hospital and also during my recovery at home. (I didn't even need to take aspirin, let alone heavy-duty pain meds!) Because the surgery was noninvasive, I was driving in a week and back at work in two weeks. I credit Dr. Keiss's skills as a surgeon and her willingness to explore every surgical option (not just the timesaving ones) with this amazingly positive outcome. She is the best!"

I was seeking a second opinion and possibly treatment. According to the Clinical Supervisor, copies of my post op reports were received. During my appointment, he said he didn't have the records. These were needed for his opinion. He gave his opinion for the GI related issues. However, I left the office without answers to my main question... the sharp pelvic pain. Two weeks later, the pain worsened. I called his office. For 3 days, the Clinical Supervisor requested him to contact me. He finally responded and left a long voicemail not addressing the pain. Sadly, he wasn't being truthful by stating that he called a week ago. When I called back, as requested by him if needed, there was no response. Since then, another doctor said she believes this could be scar tissue forming after my surgery. Dr. Bassil is a healthcare professional. He acted irresponsibly."

I called several times before getting a response and the problem was resolved. when I called today to make my annual exam appointment, I had to call 8 times until I got someone on the line. when I got the young lady, we spoke long enough for her to put me on hold. I was on hold for 10 minutes and then got transferred to the answering service. I am done. surely there is better care available in Atlanta and I will find it."

However my problem is she does not return your calls. She will have her staff respond to you. I needed to speak to her and called several times, and each time she blew me off to her staff. The staff was nice, but I am paying her for care not them. This is a deal breaker when you pay so much money for a doctor, and this says a lot about your doctor. I want to be treated like a patient not a number."

I have had at least 12 different OB GYN's during my two pregnancies and moves across the country. I was with this practice and had another great Doctor who retired. Then, I was assigned a different doctor ( whom I did not like) and finally I met Dr. Aqua. She is wonderful! The only sad part is that I visit with her once per year for my check ups and she is always on top of things... I do not know how she can recall tidbits about everyone's life so readily!

I came in 15 mins before my appointment 15 mins early and had to wait a whole an hour and 15 mins. I told the nurse that I am in a rush because I have to be back on time to pick up my kids at school bus stop. I was told I am free to leave. When Dr. Yvette Smith came in, I told her that I am not very happy that I had to wait for this long. Without any sign that she feels there is anything wrong with letting your patient / customer waiting for over an hour, She said "" You could have left"". I told her that i will definitely leave them for good after this. She then performed a cursory exam and pap smear in total silence without asking anything about my concerns / any other question. The lack of empathy or any care for their patients is appalling! This is the worst quality medical service I have ever received. I requested my medical records to be sent to my home and run.. I suggest that you do the same!!"

Furthermore, she will order absolutely unnessesary tests that have no medical indication for you and threaten you and twist it to say that she is looking out for the baby that you need to have a test done. For a test that could have been easily done in her office for free to me, she had me come to the hospital on the weekend when she was on call--she did not tell me that I would be admitted to the hospital and therefore incur a HUGE bill for a simple non-stress test (I was not even 41 weeks pregnant and everything was normal). Furthermore, two days later, I had to come back to the office and take the same test with a sonogram even though Saturday's test was normal...so then I tried to ask her why the saturday test was even necessary and she wouldn't return my calls--she only had the billing office at her office call me and obviously they were no help."

When I questioned the need to induce labor she brushed off my concerns and told me ""I didn't know enough to make that decision."" During the induction process-which spanned two full days-she wanted to give me morphine to sleep at night. I refused and just took one Ambien. I was really appalled she would suggest giving a pregnant woman morphine when clearly it was not warranted. During the induction process whenever my husband or myslef would question aomething-such as why I had to stay on my back at all times or why she wanted to give me morphine-she would become very defensive and refuse to answer the question."

I was given an extremely rare, in this country, injury at her hands. She closed me up bleeding profusely. Literally, bleeding to the point that the blood bank was called. It was a gross action from a doctor. Even nurses commented about how horrible she was. I was transferred out of that hospital after 12 days and into the hands of a miracle doctor who put me back together. She was unkind and uncaring.

She didn't listen to my wishes, broke my water, sped my labor, and ended in emergency c-section. I felt she looked down on me as a single, pregnant woman and treated me with less respect than sure would someone she perceived to be more responsible.

Then made me go for a chest X-ray when I was pregnant. All this was unnecessary. Then made me visit a infectious disease specialist due to TB skin test being positive and he was unimpressed by her knowledge of TB and BCG vaccine. Then she broke my water prematurely during checkup. I came to know later that she was actually ""sweeping my membranes"". I was forced to go the the hospital and put on Pitocin to start my labor when I was not at all ready. Overall, I had bad experiences with her and do not consider her a good doctor."

He dated her for FIVE years. He also asked her to marry him and paid for her kids private school. Granted he should not have dated a patient. Shortly after they broke up another women named Ilene became friends with Ulbrich. A patient. But just a friend. When she realized she wasn't going to get to be the next doctors wife she got together with Tina and they turned him into the board for dating patients. He is at fault for dating patients but more then that he's at fault for dating ****es. Shame on you two women for your vindictive, hateful actions. Do not think that you can do these vengeful actions and think that you will suffer no consequence.

I was nursing my son but she placed me on birth control with estrogen a few weeks after he was born, and all my milk went away. I got pregnant again almost a year after my son was born, and the very first thing she said to me, when she saw me in the ultrasound room was, ""what happened to the birth control I gave you?"" So rude, and even more so hurtful because we found out during the visit the baby didn't survive. She immediately pushed for me to have surgery to remove the baby. The only contact I ever received from her office after that were one phone call to see when I wanted to schedule surgery. She wanted to put me on birth control after my miscarriage for at least 3 months. I later realized that was because women are the most fertile for the first 3 months after a miscarriage.

I was billed for what I thought was the total amount, then realized via my insurance company that it wasn't the total amount. I called the billing office and they said I showed an amount owed, yet they hadn't sent a bill for that amount! This office is disorganized and I will NOT be going back!"

But all of the other foolishness makes it hard for me to get there. I've had better service at Wendy's than I did at this supposed ""boutique"" practice. Dr. Hood is not punctual. Her staff is not helpful. I had a miscarriage four weeks ago. From the moment I found out I was pregnant up and through now when I'm still waiting on test results from a test I took last week, this has been horrible. Google has been a better doctor to me than this woman. Her nurse has an attitude problem. She's always too busy to actually talk to me. I am still having complications that I can't get seen because her staff doesn't think it's bad enough to schedule me an appointment. I really like Dr. Hood. I can look past her punctuality issue because she is a good doctor. Her staff however is the reason I'm seeking another doctor--with haste."

At 8:25, I told a staff member that I had to be out of the office by 8:45 to get to work on time. They called me in to take my vitals, but then sent me out to wait again. I decided at 8:40 that I would have to reschedule. The nurse called my name at 8:43, but I had to leave for work. It took ten more minutes on top of that for the receptionist to reschedule me before realizing I'd have to wait more than a week for another 8am appointment, so I just requested a refund. I basically woke up earlier to drive in from Kennesaw, wasted gas (I usually take the bus to work), sat in an office for an hour, paid a $5 parking fee, and was still late to work for nothing. Not a single apology from anyone in the office either. Being a great doctor does not excuse gross disrespect of a patient's time."

I liked her knowledge of all the questions I asked her during both my pregnancies. I do agree that she is in and out of the room after she sees about you but I do believe its because she has a high volume of patients and she needs to see of of them before closing, I would recommend her to anyone looking for a obygn.

This was our first baby together, but not separately so we have experience with going through a pregnancy before. First the doctor has no bedside manner, she seemed very offensive when we want to get a second opinion to the position of our baby. Not to mention the second opinion was correct and we didn't even get an apology. Secondly there is a long wait after you are waiting for the doctor in a seperate room and she does her check fast and is out of the room in about 10 mins even though you have waited 45 mins to 1 hour. Thirdly my baby was more than full term and the doctor started to talk about the baby might die causing a stressful situation more stressful than it should have been. Thank God our baby was born 100% healthy Thanks only to God and the patience he has given us. We, I mean my husband and I even felt at times that the doctor did not particularly like both parents in the room. However we always went together since that is how we make decisions based on our Faith. Even the doctor said she had never met clients like us before that did not instantly take her advice without question! I would not recommend Dr. Katia Castillo to my enemies let alone my friends."

When I went in for my first prenatal appointment I shared with her I was still in considerable pain. She dismissed this again. I was admitted to the hospital later that week only to find that I had a large cyst on my right ovary. I also asked the doctor about specific medications safe of not to take during pregnancy. she flat out told me they were fine. I later found out some of the medications I was taking were off limits while pregnant. The nurse staff is very nice with the exception of the front desk. She never smiles and is generally very rude.

They are in her office for her ability, knowledge and because they need special care for their ailments. Dr. Dawson's manner of working with his patients leaves much to be desired. She needs to approach them with their personal medical history and take the time necessary to inform the patient and allow them time for questions. She is dry, like many other reviews have mentioned. True, it is not a social meeting, but it needs to be more personable. Originally I had hopes that Dr. Dawson would be a ""holistic"" doctor, with a personable approach and without all the publicity. This has turned out to be false. Dr. Dawson is very interested in promoting her products, assuring that her patients buy her products and insisting upon many blood tests. These blood tests are usually not covered by most insurance companies. I do not recommend Dr. Dawson and because of all my comments, above, I am switching Gynecologists!"

As an African-American woman, I sought out a practitioner that I felt I could relate to. I spent 10 years being referred to this doctor and that specialist without Dr. Dawson taking the time to personalize my care and really focus. I switched my care to a caucasian doctor who diagnosed me the same day as my initial appointment, performed in-office diagnostics and scheduled surgery to correct it. I am one week post-up and never felt-better. I don't feel that Dr. Dawson took time to personalize my care and simple referred me to her colleagues to get me out of her hair. I don't appreciate that. Her office is old, creeky, and lacks up-to-date technology and her staff is a bit empathetic. The front office staff lack personality and are often curt, rude and abrasive over the phone.

Amongst other reasons, this one instance was the icing on the cake for me. I went in for an emergency appt. and the most she did was ask me if I was still taking a medicataion that she had prescribed a year earlier. She did not examine me and I'm wondering if it was because this was not a ""scheduled"" appt. I am back on the prescription as she suggested but unfortunately my condition has not changed. It seems as though Dr. Dawson is focusing more on her specialized weight loss program which is OK but please communicate that to your other patients so that they are given the option to stay or find another doctor.

I ended up getting a partial hysterectomy. SHE WAS GREAT. She provided the pictures I asked for and called me a couple of times post surgery to make sure I was okay. I recommend Dr. Dawson to anyone that ask me for a name of a good GYN. Her holistic approach is what we need more of. People fail to understand the impact drug can have on ones system even if taken for a short peroid of time. We need a network of holisitic doctors. Thanks Dr. Dawson.

He made a second incesion and they both have a lot of scar tissue. It's enough that 5 out of 6 doctors told me I needed surgery to fix it. The only doctor that said no wanted to give it a little more time to see if the problems would stop. The area around the scar still swells and still gets tender. I've had another doctor look at the scar a couple of years ago and she was shocked at how bad the scar is and how tender it still is. The only reason Dr Healey tied my tubes is because the other doctor left the practice. If we had met Dr Healey before the procedure I would have gone somewhere else. When we went to Dr Healey to tell him I was having problems and wanted to know what he recommended. Dr Healey couldn't bother to put his phone down long enough to talk to us until we said we wanted him to pay to fix it. He has no bedside manner. I tell my female friend to avoid this practice.

And they billed me for tests I hadn't been administered. And when calling to see if my bill could be fixed, the rude woman told me that she had done the billing herself and it was right! They overcharged me almost $80. I might send her a calculator for simple math. I called back this morning to see if my records had been Reviewed. She told me Dr. Healey did it yesterday.

Later that day I called to express my feelings of how I felt and to ask why a doctor would say something like that without knowing for sure, and that I was upset. The receptionist was rude and said maybe three times and why are you upset. When I replied back, ""I was told I have cancer, when I do not!I've been worried for a week, along with my family. Do you not understand why I would be upset?"" I expected some sort of an apology, but instead I was told by her she had a college degree and then I was called a b**ch, and was hung up on.

I think that we should give him and his staff the credit they deserve instead of bad experiences. The team saved my life and create lives of many unborn cildren. The fact of the matter is the man is going to do what is best instead of what you want. He has been in practice enough to know the in and outs of gynocological conditions and treatments. Females tend to use these parts of their bodies to get pain meds and he is hip to that behavior. So if you have something wrong with you, truley I recommend this doctor for your female problems and child bearing experiences.

Dr. Healey and his staff have seen me through a miscarriage followed by a DNC and the healthy birth of my son. During my son's pregancy I was a nervous wreck and the nursing staff were always nice and helpful with any calls of concerns or questions I had. Dr. Healey was very aware of my fears of losing this pregancy and took great care to ease my fears, and was very nice when he would get a call at 2am when I went into early labor at 30wks. I ended up having to be induced when I began to bleed in my 36wk and Dr. Healey's knowledge and care allowed me to deliver a healthy baby boy. All the nurses have always been helpful and nice and I enjoy Dr. Healey's years of experience instead of a dr. who only goes by the book. I would recommend him to anyone."

I saw her two times. The rest of the time I saw a NP. When a potentially life threatening complication arose, she was very cold delivering the news. She answered none of my questions. She just told me good luck. RUN!"

There was an issue with my medical records that should have been cleared up during the two months prior that I made the appointment. I heard her yell at her staff for the lack of medical records. Then was totally rude to me. They left me in a room for an hour an half. When I complained and told them I wanted my money back. They said they just got my medical records. Which I know the hippa laws they needed my signature which they only asked for 15 min before. So they lied about trying to get them early in the morning. I arrived 45 min early they never asked for my signature. Then after all that she tells me she can't tell me anything because she doesn't have what she needed in my medical records. I was so pissed. If they had asked I could have brought them everything they needed. I will not recommend anyone going to her. I put in a complaint and working on getting my co pay back. It was such a waste of time!!!

She took time out to explain things to me during my visit and made me feel completely at ease. She answered all of my questions and was very knowledgeable and detailed in her delivery of information. I would highly recommend her to any person who seeks a nurturing and caring physician, that always goes above and beyond to help her patients."

Seems angry all the time, is rude, has no compassion towards patients, and on top of that is stubborn and made poor decisions regarding perinatal care. I do not recommend her at all and would encourage anyone who hires her to have very good background information from her superiors at Emory who definitely dislike her"

Her attitude towards me was hostile for no reason at all, it just seems to be her way of dealing with patients. She lacked compassion and empathy in her dealings with me and at one point even lied to me about a part of my treatment, which is simply unacceptable and careless.Emory Hospital lost my business because of the treatment I received from this Dr."

She and her staff were courteous and professional. She has a good rapport with her patients! She even remembered me after I had not seen her for almost 2 years. The only thing I don't like is that she is in such demand that it is hard to get an appointment; she maybe booked for months sometimes.

She is kind, warm, approachable and just a regular person. She makes you feel at ease and treats you with respect. The only drawback is that she is pretty popular and her office is pretty busy.. but that's the case with most OBGYN's these days. I feel very lucky to have found her. Now I just need a PCP as good as she is."

In terms of timeliness, the office has consistently been on par with other offices that I have visited (wait time of about 10 - 15 min). However the doctor has been less than helpful or interested in my care. From her demeanor and eagerness to get me out of the office, I do not believe that Dr. Cyd Williams is very interested in the total care of her patients. Dr. Williams seems very knowledgeable but lacks tact and the office seems to have a lacks policy on patient privacy (this includes the nurses)."

I wasn't very pleased with her response during my first visit to confirm my pregnancy. My pregnancy was high risk and I left the appointment on the verge of tears - not about the pregnancy as much as how she imparted information. She was distant, cold and made me feel dumb for being a high risk pregnancy. I believe she is competent but after two more visits with her I decided to change to a doctor with a better attitude."

Dr. Williams was the one who I liked the least. She seemed rushed the whole appointment. She acted as though she couldn't wait to get out of the room, and she seemed annoyed that I asked her normal, routine questions. I saw her twice while I was pregnant and she was like this each time. On the last visit, her cell phone rang in the middle of my appointment. She unbelievable pulled out her phone, looked to see who was calling and went to answer it. She looked at me and saw the look on my face which must've been a mix between shock and disgust. Fortunately, she put her phone away."

I was left with internet research to explain what was going on, which was awful and completely unacceptable. I would NOT recommend her if you want a doctor to explain answers and make you feel like a person and not one more thing that has to be done."

When I asked Dr. Fogle to repeat the 8 point BPP with me she very rude and curt told me that she can not because the ultrasound tech was in the room for more that 30 minutes. Unbelievable based on the fact that my baby was not cooperating or moving. Because of her falsifying my records I will be filing a complaint against her medical license. Stay away from this doctor!!!

She is very direct and doesn't sugar coat anything, and almost seems like she's using scare tactics. Especially when delivering bad news, I prefer a doctor who seems to have compassion and empathy. She was very clinical (and cold) and I left the appointment in tears. Won't be going back to her."

I had to see Dr. Fogle because my main doctor was out of town. I felt that Dr. Fogle came across abrasive and not really warm. She left me on the table waiting for her (it happens I guess) so when she came in I was hoping for a more upbeat energy. The physician I usually see is very friendly, knowledgable and makes an effort to make me feel comfortable. The experience with her was you need to do this, this and that. Almost like you were being lectured and then asked me if somebody had given be different information by the look on my face. To be fair, Im not her patient. However, I wouldn't want to her again. "
931,Dr. Dian Fogle,Atlanta,Georgia, Gynecologists (OBGYN) , Female,5,3.1,2013-05-30T15:46:02Z,2,4,1,1,2,"After the technician did our ultrasound I was left to wait on the table for about 20-25 min for Dr. Fogle. I am very pregnant and lying flat on my back on a hard table for that long was excruciating. When she finally showed up, we were interrupted twice - she did say she covering other people's patients, so I tried to be patient. However, she wasn't even going to do her own ultrasound (standard procedure at this practice), which meant I was left on the waiting on the table unnecessarily. She rushed through the appointment and didn't give me any time up front to ask questions. Long story short, I felt judged over some inconsistent logging of my blood sugars, and when I tried to explain why and ask questions, I was cut off. No effort to listen, understand, empathize, or, most importantly, solve the problem. Just, ""You should be doing this,"" and threat of still birth wielded like a club to scare me straight. I would not recommend this doctor."

I was 15min late for that appointment. She took a ultrasound for me and kaiser Ultrasound machine didn't show any thing. Dr.Fisher said its a misscarriage. Me and my DH were so nervous and dont know what to do. Then we paid from our out of pocket and went to my previous gyne. He was able to clearly show the baby's heat beat and the growth was 7 weeks 1 day. Dr.Fisher was really upset that I was late to the apointment and never thought I going to have that kind of stress after seeing her. I dont know why she said that I going to have misscarraige. If she couldnt see the baby properly she shouldnt have told me like that. And I was really worried and thought my life is going to go away. Lucky I contact my previous gyne and he was ready to help me. I would never recommend Dr.Fisher even to the person I hate most in this world. She did not have professionalism.

We were successful! He was so kind, tender and patient with each subsequent delivery. To see a doctor with as much experience under his belt come to tears and declare, ""It's a miracle!"" when my daughter was born was a very moving experience.

That was awkward because if anyone else knew the answers to the security questions they posed, they could have heard my test results. I have a twin sister and with them asking even my last 4 digits of my social, my sister knows the answer. I strongly suggest asking a password question so that it will be more secure."

I've never been sick before so I had a lot of questions and concerns,I felt uncomfortable about being nude and answering questions about my personal sex life,I wasn't fast at answering questions because I didn't expect them. I felt exposed. So,to have someone treat me like I was slow, or like I should feel better by now, or well since I've seen you today 1 week after surgery don't bother to come back for your follow up which should be 3 weeks later and ""oh you're still having symptons"" I'll call in a prescription and not tell you its there..is off putting to say the least. NO,it is rude and disrespectful. I still have symptoms but I AM NOT GOING BACK. She is knowledgeable and if courtesy is not importatant this might be a match."

As a newly-pregnant woman, this was very disappointing, because I had wanted to see if she would be the best doctor for me. The woman that did inspect me did not ask me any questions about how I was feeling. She only asked if I had questions for her. I forgot to ask about swine flu vaccines, and she never brought it up. She then told be that at their practice, the doctors rotate out, and there was only a 1 in 4 chance that Dr. Lemon would deliver my baby.

Just now getting to the point I can share because I was very angry. I had post-menopausal very heavy clotting and bleeding. She wanted me to come to the office for uterine biopsies, not once, but three times. Ridiculous. and painful. Also had several expensive ultrasounds over a year. The last time I saw her she talked fast, seemed rushed, yet I could hear here chatting away with a friend in the next room before she came to mine... had lots of time to talk with her. She tried to minimize my problem even though I was passing giant clots. Suggested that I might had a urinary tract problem, so urine was cultured unnecessarily, of course the office could profit from that, too. The next day I went to see my internist, who did an exam, was horrified with what she saw, and got me referred immediately to a different gynecologist. I was scheduled for a hysterectomy the next week. Fast forward a few months from that point and I had a neighbor telling me that Dr Cummings had scheduled her for another ultrasound and uterine biopsy in the office.... I was horrified to realize that we both were part of a plan to stall and not address real problems, all the while the dr's office was collecting large fees from insurance. My neighbor went to a different gynecologist and guess what she also needed a hysterectomy. I would say to any woman out there to stay away from that dr's office. I personally would not trust anything there after my experiences. There are much better options."

The woman that I spoke to had no solutions to get me in quickly based on another members mistake and I was told Dr. Laura Cummings is very busy. I am VERY busy too and had to get several hours out of my work schedule to make this appointment, drive to the office, pay $4 to park and was EXTREMLY disappointed in the outcome.

She is very professional & very knowledgeable. My wait time before seeing Dr. Carroll was about 25-30 minutes & that included signing in. She DOES care about her patients & she will cover everything you need to know. I would recommend her to anyone.
1070,Dr. Kimberly Carroll,Atlanta,Georgia, Gynecologists (OBGYN) , Female,2,3.5,2014-04-07T14:29:58Z,2,4,1,2,1,First Dr. Carroll didn't even introduce herself when she came in the room. This was my first visit. She was not very personal. I came to doctor Carroll because I was looking for a black doctor that I would be comfortable around. She did not make my doctors visit a great one. The office charged my visit as a specialty visit for asking a question and Dr. Carroll writing a prescription for something she found. Then I waited in the waiting room for two hours. This was a bad experience and I would not recommend anyone visit this office. I think I will return to my old doctor because she was not impressive at all.

Dr. Gibbons is very nice and instantly made me feel relaxed and comfortable during appointments. I also like that her staff do follow up calls after appointments. Staff is very helpful and friendly. Will never go to another Obgyn as long as I'm in Atlanta. Would recommend her to family and friends.

Google her name to find a litany of complaints about her staff and first patient treatment. No matter how good a doctor might be, her front desk tells you a lot about how they really feel about you as a patient. You go to get well and receive proper care, not be berated and treated rudely by ignorant personnel."

She is the best doctor I have ever spoken to or been involved with. She delayed some plans she already had to make sure she could be there to deliver our son. If she is rated below 5 then I would say something is wrong with the patient before it would be the doctor. I wish I could give out my contact info to be a reference because you dont find doctors like her very often. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

I'm an RN, and she acted like my educated thoughts on different thoughts or diagnoses about my health were stupid/outrageous/unimportant. She brushed it off like it was not important and not even a feasible possibility for my health to be a certain way. THEN, she billed my insurance for the diagnosis she didn't even help me with! The blood work she so graciously offered to me after she discredited my thoughts about blood level imbalances they ""did not get enough blood work,"" when I gave plenty of tubes and have very easy veins to stick did not even provide any answers for the ""diagnosis"" she billed me for. Then to add insult to injury their office manager never called me back when I had complaints submitted through the business office about how/why I did not want to pay. I'm very frustrated with her and this entire practice. I've only been there once, but I'll definitely keep writing reviews and will never recommend anyone to go there!"

When visiting with Dr. Miller I did not have that personal experience. My first visit was done with a nurse in the room.

I am over 40 - with a history of family cancer. After my apt (where I did not have the pap smear based on her advice though it had been 1.5 years since my last) I checked online and with a colleague (who is a medical dr. though not gynecologist.) Online I found that the maximum length of time someone should go between pap smears was 3 years (not 5). Also, my colleague told me that her dr. recommended every year for women over 40."

I waited over two hours to see Dr Yap and she spent less than 5 minutes with me before telling me I need surgery. She dismissed my questions, did not listen, and did not explain or give a clear diagnosis. She was extrememly rude and either made snide comments or interrupted when I asked questions.

Meanwhile, I could hear her in the room next to me while she ""worked in"" another patient before me. Next, she was in the hall dealing with the pharmaceutical sales rep. Excuse me, but I'm a patient. The sales rep wants to SELL YOU SOMETHING! She will wait! Trust me! I got up and left. I told the woman at checkout that I was leaving and as I turned toward the exit, the doctor chased me down and asked if I had 5 minutes. Yeah - I had an hour but you just blew it! She didn't have my chart of my study that she was supposed to be consulting me on. She didn't even know which doctor had referred me. She called later and recommended a procedure for me that has alarming side effects and a low rate of rehabilitation. Stay away. Oh, on top of it, I got a bill today for her ""consultation""!!!!"

I was referred to her for a second opinion because I was told that I needed a hysterectomy. She confirmed that surgery was indeed needed and based on the level of discomfort and the length of time that I had suffered she scheduled as soon as I was mentally ready to move forward. I had several appointments with her before the actual surgery. The office staff was very professional and friendly. Dr. Howard made sure that I had a clear understanding concerning the procedure as well as what to expect afterwards. Her bedside manner was great. After I woke up from surgery and the room visits that followed I couldn’t have asked for better treatment. She didn’t treat me as just another patient there was a genuine care. One of the reasons it took me so long to agree to having surgery was because I was afraid Dr. Howard I would recommend her anyone in need of a good Ob/Gyn or facing surgery.

My partner recovered from Hep C and I was trying to understand if I may be at risk. His response was ""It's probably fine so long as your partner is telling the truth."" This did not answer any of my questions or allow me to understand if I am at risk. This is the type of doctoring that leads people to not come back.
I've been seen by Dr. Kalinda Woods in the same office and the difference in my treatment was astronomical. If you want to be treated with respect as an adult, avoid Dr. Weiss and ask for Dr. Woods instead. "

She did not bother to tell us that the baby was sunny side up. Instead of giving me the option of a c-section due to the big baby, low water level, and mecanium, she took the baby with forceps and caused me have a third degree tear.

Baby looked fine and he said not to worry, the bleed would go away and all was well. He told me to come back for my regular 12 week check up and no follow up would be necessary. Well, two days before that 12 week check up, I started bleeding more heavily than before and it turned out that little baby could no longer survive b/c my placenta was detaching from the bleed. There are options for trying to treat this diagnosis, although this doctor offered none of that. I am now pregnant again, have the same diagnosis with a different doc and baby is doing well with the help of weekly ultrasounds, blood work, and meds to monitor and control the bleed.

I am new to Atlanta and needed a doctor covered by my insurance. I waited over an hour to see Dr. Kassam and when I asked her staff whether I should just try to make another appointment because of the long wait I was told that most patients have to wait 2 hours and I shouldn't complain. When I finally got to see her, Dr. Kassam told me that the best way to address my heavy periods was to have a hysterectomy right away. When I asked about other options - for example, shouldn't I have an ultrasound first - she told me that American women whine all the time and have no tolerance for pain. Whoa. I had to convince her that I should an ultrasound first. I did that and the office LOST my lab work and told me I needed to go ahead and schedule surgery. When I saw Dr. Kassam again, she was so rude to me that I just left before the exam was over."

The billing department billed me incorrectly for a significant sum that I had paid in office and got nasty with me when I tried to help resolve the situation with my insurance company. Before I even went to see her I confirmed several times with her and my insurance company that everything would indeed be covered 100%. After receiving incorrect bills I tried multiple times to straighten the amount out with her office, but to no avail. Finally, I told her office that I would go in in-person and we could adjust the discrepancies with my insurance company together so we'd all be on the same page. Her scheduler told me that I would be billed for an office visit if I were to COME IN, and not even to see the doctor! Dishonest and incompetent office staff who would not own up to having made mistakes."

Him and his staff take the time to answer even the smallest concerns (BTW- I am one of those people that google EVERYTHING and freak myself out). They have never rushed through my appointments. I unfortunately had a miscarriage in my 3rd pregnancy and they were very helpful and supportive throughout the whole process (I was actually the first patient to have a miscarriage since they opened their Canton office and they took very good care of me). He assured me that it was normal and that I would be able to conceive again without any problems. And sure enough I was back in his office several months later. Dr. Scott has a great personality and he is very respectful. Every time my husband and I are in his office we get to hear one of his crazy life stories! Very funny guy and I recommend him to all of my friends!

Scott,Atlanta,Georgia, Gynecologists (OBGYN) , Male,40,4.68,2017-12-19T00:03:25.246Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Based on my personal experience, I should say that under Dr. Scott’s care, it’s the best OBGYN experience I’ve had. He did an excellent job in making me feel comfortable during my appointments. The people from Peachtree Women's are very helpful, courteous and attentive. Though I was initially hesitant about having a male doctor, Dr. Scott is skillful, talented, and experienced. I couldn’t have picked a better doctor myself and he has been helping me deal with my polycystic ovarian syndrome (or PCOS), sharing with me the treatments and all the medical assistance I need, from getting a workup, to ultrasound checks and other lab tests, as well as my annual pap smear. He has taught me diet and lifestyle hacks to help improve my quality of life and even the other patients of his can say the same thing. Peachtree Women's really does provide the highest quality and most compassionate healthcare any woman of any age can possibly want. Amazing place with amazing doctors. I highly recommend them!
When I was younger, I dreaded going to clinics for gynecological or female health care. But as life went on, I eventually got married and time came when my husband and I wanted to have a child of our own. We’ve been seeing different doctors at Peachtree but one of our favorite is Dr. Garcia. He is quite an amazing doctor who is intelligent, attentive, very patient, and always follows through and follows up. I like his style and he’s a great listener as well as explains things clearly. Everyone at the Peachtree is really nice. They are very efficient and organized. I’ve gotten all my ultrasounds and personalized lab tests and the doctors always thoroughly explain the results in a way that I can understand them. Medical speak can be intimidating but the doctors make you feel comfortable and really know how to break it down in layman’s terms. During the infertility evaluation that we had, we were offered basic assessments of fertility that included preconception counselling. I am aware that getting pregnant in my case can be challenging but I am confident with the doctors we’re working with who are very professional and have taken time to discuss all the options available to us. Can’t wait for our next appointment!"

Scott,Atlanta,Georgia, Gynecologists (OBGYN) , Male,40,4.68,2017-12-18T15:40:15.209Z,1.5,2,1,1,2,"I can only assume the positive reviews are him or his staff because I've never seen a doctor with less concern for patient's time and care. He was 1 hour and 36 minutes late for his first appointment of the day, walked in and gave me about 4 minutes of his time (he was dressed in casual clothes and not scrubs so him being on call was not the issue). I have very large babies on my side of the family and my husbands family also has a history of babies over 9 lbs. I tried to explain to Dr. Scott that because of this I was concerned about my babies size at full-term and wanted an honest opinion about large babies and first time mothers, advice on whether a scan in the 3rd trimester was recommended, and the likelihood of cesarean sections with babies over 9 lbs. Was told that I wasn't a ""small-statured person being that I'm over 5'8"" tall"" and my concerns were flippantly disregarded as he rushed to get to his next appointment that he was neglecting in another exam room. I didn't realize the size of your birth canal was directly tied to your height. My mother who is also my size had to have a cesarean with my sister because my sisters head literally could not fit through my mother's pelvis and later had a scheduled cesarean with me.

He is validating, kind, a total sweetheart, humble but confident, has an AMAZING team, and he was able to instantly feel endometriosis adhesions in places my other doctors completely missed during physical exams. Further, he was able to effectively operate on things that other doctors told me were inoperable, and other decent-but-not-as-good 'experts' couldn't quite clean up ins.

I had read that the CEC was top notch in excision of endometriosis, and they definitely are. I was able to have an appointment with Dr. Kongoasa soon after since I am local and met with Dr. Sinervo right before my surgery. They were both knowledgeable and answered all of my questions. They did find and excise endometriosis and have been helpful during my recovery and answer any questions that come up. Dr. Sinervo who did my surgery was very kind and showed my parents photos and explained everything that he found right after the surgery.

The staff is very welcoming and kind, and has provided me with a lot of strength and support. Wendy, the head surgical nurse, is so warm and thoughtful. I felt extremely comfortable with Dr. Kongoasa and his whole team. One note is that Dr. Kongoasa does practice Catholic medicine, meaning he does not prescribe birth control or IUDs unless extremely necessary for pain. So if you bring this up to him, he may not discuss birth control options with you extensively, but anyone else at his practice can help you with that, and Dr. Kongoasa usually recommends talking with a colleague or other OBGYN about that."

He respected my wishes to have a Hysterectomy for suspected Adenomyosis because I wasn't comfortable with the odds of a PSN working for me. He respected all of my wishes, addressed all of my concerns, and answered all of my questions. The staff at the CEC are remarkably friendly, the nursing staff is skilled, and the building itself is comfortable rather than ""sterile"" and medical. My surgery experience with Dr. K was nothing short of remarkable. First, he and the nurses/medical staff prayed with me before surgery at my request (if you prefer not to pray, he will not ask/force you to). He keenly identified even the most subtle endometriosis and excised it COMPLETELY, leaving no trace of disease behind. His staff provided my husband with HOURLY updates, and even upheld my half-conscious pre-op request to tell my husband I loved him with each update. Dr. K gave my husband photos and updated him on what he did during surgery. I would recommend bringing a recording device so that whomever Dr. K updates will have information ready for you post-surgery, as Dr. K may not be able to see you after surgery. The post-op visit was non-invasive, and Dr. K gave me yet another hug at the end of my visit. I've never met a doctor quite like Dr. K. From the combination of being soft-spoken and friendly, yet confident and direct, to his warm half-smile, to his hugs at the end of every visit, Dr. K is a tremendously skilled surgeon that any endometriosis/adenomyosis patient should consider seeing!"

Before performing a D & C on me he came and sat in Pre-Op with me and his actions provided a very calming influence to my anxiety. He also perfomed a follow-up endometrial biopsy that was absolutely painless. He is the best gynocoligist I have ever had experience with. He is an awesome individual and an excellent physician. My daughter also goes to Dr. Angus and had had some difficult and painful experiences with outher gynecologists in the past. Dr. Angus showed the same caring and compassionate consideration with her and took extraordinary measures to ensure that her Colposcopy was a pain free and anxiety free as possible."

While he was exploring me he used just one glove for the hand that was using. Might sound like something without importance but since he was touching my thigh to try to make me relax (with the opposite effect, of course), that made me feel ten times more uncomfortable. He is a nice person, I'm sure he is a great doctor. Also, I have a cat and I had to DEMAND the toxoplasmosis test when I got pregnant, because he said it wasn't necessary.
His nurse is AMAZING though."

I felt rushed into my c-section. I’m shocked to read these other reviews about him being so caring. I felt he was insensitive and my nurse had to help calm me down. My epidural failed (not his fault) but I wish he would have stepped in and told the anesthesiologist To put me under. I felt everything. The cutting. Pulling. Tugging. I had to request to be checked on 2 days after the emergency c section while at northside. The experience was pretty bad. I won’t have a second child with this practice.

He seems like a very busy man but I have never felt rushed...even as i've started asking last minute questions as he was walking out the door. He stops without hesitation/irritation, listens to my questions and gives me answers that do not make me feel nervous/anxious, stupid or afraid. He does a really good job at making you feel comfortable physically and mentally. My only not so great comment that I have is that I was not given all options available to me regarding an issue that needed to be addressed. Although the procedure he recommended has the best outcome rates and the after effects are similar, it would have been nice to know that there was another option so that I could weigh the pros and cons of each....even if I did agree with his choice.

Dr. Sharon performed a flawless c-section and delivered my healthy baby boy. For the past 11 years I have seen him for my yearly physicals and just can't say enough about him. He is smart, funny, and kind. He actually listens to you and isn't in a rush. Dr. Sharon is actually a doctor that you don't mind visiting every year.

Indeed, I regard him as a genius. Dr. Randell is an excellent and highly skilled surgeon in this field who has dedicated his life and career to promoting the reproductive health and well being of women. He is truly dedicated to his patients and provides them with the kind of focused, conscientious and sustained care rarely offered in other places. I learned about his practice on the internet and got in touch last December when I sensed that my fibroid situation was worsening. My abdomen was protruding more and more, to the point that it resembled the size of a five-month pregnancy, and the symptoms were becoming more uncomfortable and unbearable. I wasn’t satisfied with the recommendations that I received in the town where I live, from an Ob-Gyn whose first suggestion had been a hysterectomy several years ago, to a radiologist who kept suggesting that I was a “good candidate” for UAE to shrink them. On 7/20/2018, Dr. Randell removed all 74 fibroids from my uterus through an abdominal myomectomy. I still can’t believe the staggering number. Seeing the photo helped me understand just how many there were. This shows me that I’d never even been properly diagnosed or fully evaluated for them until I visited Dr. Randell’s office. This was shocking when considering that I’d had two open abdominal myomectomies in the past. The first one was at age 26 in 1998, in which 1 or maybe 2 fibroids were removed; I was treated with Depot Lupron on the road to it. The second was at age 37 in 2008, in which 5 fibroids were removed; I’d briefly been treated with Danazol by the Ob-Gyn doctor who came with my health plan before meeting the IVF surgeon who performed that surgery. It wasn’t until after my second surgery that I even began to hear some stories of how many fibroids were possible for women to have. I never imagined that I had a high number myself, especially as a tall, thin woman. The expertise of Dr. Randell diagnosed and addressed this problem at an entirely different level and gave me the help and solutions I needed. I feel so much better, renewed and rebuilt with an opportunity to live again and reach my fullest potential in my life and work. I am truly privileged and blessed to have been treated by a top-notch surgeon like Dr. Randell."

It was only three small incisions done, and my recovery time was outstanding. I received a call from him directly after the second day home from surgery to check on me. I thought that was awesome! He is very personable and passionate about his work. Dr. Randell gave me several pictures of my surgery process to review, and he gave me encouragement about being able to conceive. I am very pleased that I chose to have the procedure done robotically. The procedure only took a couple of hours, and he's an awesome surgeon!

He took the time to talk through every aspect of my MRI, the steps for the surgery, and after-care. After spending time with him in my initial consult, I knew he had the interest and skills to perform this surgery. I highly recommend Dr. Randell if you have any uterine issues. "

I was so much in pain I was at the emergency almost every weekend and the doctor wanted to place me on Lupron to throw me into menopause and or perform another surgery on me that would take me 6 weeks to heal. I couldn't afford to be out of work. Then I did my research and decided to seek a second opinion with Dr. Randell which am glad I did because as soon as I sat with me to evaluate me, I knew I had come to the right person, he ordered MRI and showed I had a lot of Fibroids and big one right in my Uterus, he assured me, he will take care of it, I was still not 100% convinced. Long story short I had the second Surgery with Dr. Randell and it was the best experience ever. I have just been cleared for 6 weeks Post surgery, and there aren't any signs of Fibroids, everything gone, my period came and it was just normal. I feel great. I just wanna say thank you so much for giving me my life back, I don't know what pains feels like anymore. Dr. Randell is very thorough with everything, he takes his patients seriously and explains everything, answers any concerns no matter what, he gets you involved with the best solution there is for you and decide together on the right solution"

One of my fibroids was very large, and he was able to remove it laproscopically through a belly button incision. I had zero complications, and my scarring is sooo minimal!

I had so much confidence in him then he ask me to come into his practice as a regular patient. A month or so passed and I returned to see him for an evaluation. I told him I had decided to be one of his regular patients. He was like a different person, he told me that he would do my examine but he would not become my doctor. He is not the only doctor in this world of ours but he really let me down in a very difficult time in my life. I thought he really cared about his patients but was I fooled."

It was so large that it was pushing my other organs out of the way. Another cyst on my right ovary and a fibroid in my uterus. I went to another OBGYN who told me I would need to be cut open and would never have children. I'm only 25 and I want a big family. (Like 7 kids big) We found doctor Randell and from the very first appointment he was amazing. So confident and knowledgeable. He told me everything I needed to be prepared. The surgery went better than expected! He some how removed an 18cm robotically through my belly button! The surgery was very minimally invasive and it doesn't hurt at all while I'm I recovery. He somehow preserved my ovary and uterus and I still can have that big family that I want! I seriously thank God for Doctor Randell. What he is doing is amazing. The fact that he specializes in this makes it better. Such a heart for women and not at all like other doctors!"

Being pregnant with my first child, I was very picky and wanted nothing short of the best from an OB/GYN. That is exactly what I got and then some! Dr. Soufi always took time to explain things to me and really made me feel like she cared deeply for me and my baby’s well-being. She was always very quick to respond to my messages sent through the portal. For example, I sent a message on a Sunday once just thinking to myself that I would hear back the next day and about an hour later, she called me. I was completely shocked! Dr. Soufi has an enormous amount of compassion and always made me feel comfortable. The delivery of my little girl went very well and I couldn’t ask for more. An added bonus is she has the best assistant in the world, Torie!! Absolutely love them as a team and felt completely taken care of. I am hoping GOD blesses with another child and if so, it’s a no brainer that I’ll be going right back to Dr. Soufi!"

She has an extraordinary ""bedside"" manner and explains your medical assessment in a very clear and concise manner. She really cares about her patients and listens intensely to their health concerns. Unfortunately for me, I've always dealt with high risk pregnancies. So locating a gentle, informed, and thorough physician was always our top priority. We couldn't imagine finding all of the qualities (and more) we were looking for in Dr, Soufi. We always left her office feeling assured that every precaution was taken to ensure a healthy and safe delivery. We were ""NEVER"" disappointed!! Words can't express our gratitude and appreciation we have for her and her staff. Service and care beyond what money can buy."

She is thorough, caring, professional, attentive, and most important to me....she listened to all my questions and concerns!!! She delivered 2 of my babies and one was a premie and she took THE BEST care of me and my baby!!!! With my last pregnancy, she took even better care of me to make sure my third baby got the BEST CARE to help prevent preterm labor for a second time! After delivery she always checked on me HERSELF and when I needed extra attention, she ALWAYS answered the nurses call to request additional meds or what ever I needed!!! I never had to wait for care after delivering by babies!!!! Again, if you are looking for a doctor to take care of you and your baby...LOOK NO FURTHER!!! Dr. Soufi and her staff are amazing!!! Please keep in mind that because Dr. Soufi is amazing, she sometimes may have an emergency that may interrupt your appointment because she will have to leave to go to the hospital. Therefore, your wait time might be longer. However, keep in mind if she is your doctor and you have an emergency, I'm sure you would want her to do the same for you!! So please be patient and stick with her! You will not regret it!!!

She is conservative in her practices, always looking out for the patient. She asks for your input and lets you be involved in your care. Her practice takes call for their own patients during the week. This can make for longer wait times for appointments, but you have a greater chance of your doctor delivering you. She delivered all three of my children after her office hours. She stayed late to see each delivery through and made sure everything went well, which it did!"

I came to her with Stage IV Endometriosis. From the first appointment, I could tell how attentive and patient she is with her patients. She listened to me, let me share my concerns and worked with me to create a plan. She was there during every step of my struggle, even when I was technically out of her care. It has been 9 months since my last surgery and I recently had a check up. I was so happy to share the amazing progress that I have had over the last several months. Dr. Stepanian is the kind of caring person that doesn’t just take note of your accomplishments, but rejoices with you in them. I could go on and on about how compassionate she is, however, I do not want to leave out the fact that she is a meticulous surgeon and is constantly working on new research and innovations in her field. Do not let the thought of a slight wait in her office keep you from getting the care you need. This only means that she takes her time and listens to her patients, giving thorough attention to each person she sees. I am so thankful to Dr. Stepanian, not only for the amazing results, but for being there at every step of the way."

I commence this review with informative & genuine sentiments. Dr. Assia A. Stepanian practices with genuine compassion. Once again, she has delivered beyond exceptional care to me & some of my family members & friends & even their parents etc. She went above & beyond & coordinated her schedule to be present during my high risk & major surgery.!!! This is rare indeed, if not nonexistent! She ensured that I was in the absolute best hands & my trust in her was already firm but it intensified more. She collaborated with a brilliant physician, Dr. Joseph Boveri, who is smooth, cool, experienced, an excellent listener, respecter of ones views of their health approach & more. Together they partnered up & helped me tremendously. Because Dr. Stepanian was present, I felt at ease & at peace mentally & at heart. Dr. Stepanian did not close me out or turn me away despite my complex medical condition. Having her present meant more than the world to me! She came by to check on me multiple times, called me after a long days work & texted me & responded to my texts despite her extremely busy schedule. She will ALWAYS be my blessing & dear one! I continue to pass her cards out even to complete strangers. If only the world were full of Dr. Assia A. Stepanian's, women's health care would be on another level in a positive way!

I love this lady! After getting away -- no RUNNING FAST -- From Dr. Felicia Dawson in Midtown, I stumbled upon Dr. Step. in my search for holistic gynecologist. Dr. Stepanian has a wonderful bedside manner. Though you may have to wait on occasion, her svc is well worth it. She's very cordial, friendly, knowledgeable and most importantly, she's thorough! My previous gyno just blew off my pelvic pain and abnormal bleeding. Said it was not gynecologic in nature, that I need to see a gastroenterologist. Nonsense! But thanks to Dr. Stepanian, the problem was identified. She was very skilled in removing some polyps and monitoring the thickness of my uterine lining. The only thing that I feel like I miss out on is consultation/advice regarding diet, weight, lifestyle and overall health maintenance. I expected this to be part of the holistic gynecology approach. A lot of patients don't want to hear their gyno talk to them about losing weight and mental issues and stress, but at the end of the day, our health is wholly integrated. It's all connected. Anytime I get serious about dealing with what I'm eating and what's eating me, I watch all of my gynecologist problem improve!!! (With no co-pay required!) And that's the kind of approach I expect to get from a holistic practitioner. Still, I wouldn't trade Dr. Assia Stepanian for ALL my previous gynecologists combined! :-)"

She was very nice and seemed to be knowledgeable overall. I DO NOT like the staff! It is hard to find out any information on your own test results. I called and requested a return call from someone to get more information on my test results and did not receive a return call. I then called again 2 days ago and requested Dr. Garcia give me a return call due to the nurse never called me back. As of today I have still not received a return call. I went to another Dr to get a second opinion on what i could recall they told me. Something could have been seriously wrong with me and for a Dr's office not to return a call in a week 1/2 is unacceptable. Especially after you have already paid them. I really wanted Dr Garcia to deliver my child but I thinkI will look for another OBGYN who's staff actually return calls. Im scared that when I do become pregnant & have questions no one would return my calls. Good doctor but horrible staff & customer service skills.

Non-surgical remedies did not work, which meant surgery loomed on the horizon. My ob-gyn wasn’t experienced with cystocele (bladder protrusion) repair and recommended I find a board certified urogynecologist. There were none in my immediate area, but I found Drs Miklos and Moore in Atlanta. They had the education, certifications, and experience I was looking for.
Although I was terrified at the extent of surgery needed (cystocele repair, vaginal repair, and hysterectomy), it was easy to see everyone in the office really knew what they were doing. Dr. Moore does not use robotic surgery, as it really isn’t needed for this type of surgery. Further he feels the use of robotics doubles the time the patient is under anesthesia which presents its own set of concerns. From there we chatted about studies relating to the best techniques and materials – I had a lot of questions, and Dr. Moore was willing to spend for long as I needed.
Everyone in the office was great. Dr. Moore's staff helped me coordinate paperwork, insurance, office visits, and surgery. Danielle provided support as she responded within two hours to every email question I had. Prior to surgery, I needed to have a couple of bladder tests. This is when I met Dr. Hawkins. She was calming and efficient, and I was happy to learn both she and Dr. Moore were going to do the surgery together.
I was EXTREMELY nervous about the extent of the surgery, but the office was prepared for pre-op jitters and handled it well. After the surgery (hospital stay of 23 hours), I had 3 tiny incisions in my abdomen that were glued, not stitched. I was up and walking the halls a few hours later. I went home, and within three days, I did not even need pain meds. Now, 12 weeks later, I feel completely normal and suffered no complications. Even better, the surgery completely resolved my pelvic organ prolapse, and I’m able to resume my active life. I can’t thank Dr. Moore and Dr. Hawkins (and Danielle) enough. The experience and results surpassed my (and my husband’s) expectations.

For months I was suffering from incontinence due to a vesicovaginal fistula after an open hysterectomy. I found Dr Moore via the Internet and I wrote him few questions on how to repair it in which he replied with miles of details. He gave me confidence that he's the doctor for me and thus I booked the surgery with him. As l lived in Hong Kong (China) I did not know what to do and where to stay in Atlanta, his staff arranged everything for me . So from Hong Hong to Atlanta my husband and I went for my surgery in Aug 2010. Dr Moore and his staff were wonderful and kind to us. The surgery was superbly performed and I received the best care possible. Now nearly 5 years after, I continue to enjoy good health and wonderful living. Thank you Dr Moore and your staff for restoring my health! "

They were efficient in explaining the steps of testing that had to be done and working around my work schedule, especially being I was out of state. The doctor was extremely knowledgeable, he spent time with me and my husband explaining the procedure. He showed visual pictures which made it easier to understand the surgery. The doctor was very compassionate toward my concerns. I appreciate the time the doctor and staff had spent with myself and husband. It made the experience very pleasurable, I would recommend anyone to see this doctor the surgery was a success."

I had an operation over 2 years ago and his staff still call to see how I am doing. I originally found Dr. Moore after researching procedures through the internet and then communicated via email. After reviewing my records Dr. Moore's staff helped me coordinate paperwork, insurance, office visits, surgery, travel, hotel & even a nurse to check on me once I got home since I was out-of-state (FL). Dr. Moore & Dr. Milkos laparoscopically repaired a vesco-vaginal fistula which resulted from a previous hysterectomy performed by a Dr. in Orlando FL. I had several procedures done by several Dr.s in Florida after the hysterectomy which worsened my condition and I was about to give up before I found Dr. Moore. I thank God every day for finding Dr. Moore and for the successful operation that finally brought my life back to normal. Dr. Moore and Dr. Miklos including their professional staff are in a league of their own."

Every follow up appointment I had was canceled. He seemed very annoyed at my questions and made me feel ignorant, if I did not understand what he was telling me. His inability to answer my questions in a way that I could understand made me lack confidence in his abilities as a physician. I felt his rudeness to me was very personal. He seems to value patients that are nurses or doctors which would explain the positive comments from the nurses. I was just a lay person and of no significance in the eyes of Dr. Moore."

I had my first visit with him in January 09' after going from doctor to doctor to find the source of the continual pain that I had been in for a while. He spoke with me for about 30 minutes before the exam and then over an hour after the exam, explaining in detail what was going on with me. I'm 54 years old, and I've never been to a doctor that spent that amount of time talking to me! He wrote down my diagnosis and drew pictures and diagrams to show me what was going on. It turned out that I had multiple problems causing the pain. I had surgery in March, four weeks ago. I feel amazing already, and for the first time in a long time I have hope for the future, all because of Dr. Moore and his surgical expertise. I should also mention his office staff (all of them), who are amazing. They have returned every call, answered every (multiple)question, and have the best attitude of any office I've ever been to. I highly recommend this practice."

He helped me with a uterine mass; however, the ultrasound performed before the procedure also showed clear signs of ovarian cysts and signs of endometriosis. He did not discuss either of these with me, suggested I have a baby out of the blue without explaining, and when I requested to see my medical files, his staff refused to me and to a request from another medical facility I had begun to work with who were able to perform the necessary diagnoses and operations needed in addition to what Knoer performed and stopped at. His care fell short and left me seeking help from another doctor who listened to me and ended up performing emergency surgery, which would not have been necessary if Knoer had treated all of my disease and had been willing to communicate with me in a transparent, respectful manner, like by describing the disease and its effects on my organs rather than saying nothing and telling me to get pregnant, regardless of what I wanted."

I was overdue and induced (twice - the first time was unsuccessful so we started over the next day) and every doctor and nurse agreed on one thing: my baby was going to be big. I was really scared I would end up with a c-section, but Dr. Graham was incredibly patient and calm and gave my body the time it needed to have this baby as naturally as possible. I found out after I delivered that his wife used to be a midwife and he approaches delivery a little differently. My own doctor even said if any other doctor would have been on call that day, he would have performed a c-section rather than let me labor for so long. The best thing about my delivery was that after Dr. Graham delivered the head and shoulders, he let me pull her out the rest of the way. Not everyone would be into that, but I thought it was incredible. So glad to have had him deliver my sweet baby girl!
The one drawback is that this practice has about 10 doctors in 4 offices who all take turns at the hospital. The odds of having him deliver me next time are pretty low, especially if I go into labor spontaneously. "

I felt extremely rushed at every visit. I was complaining about bleeding (sporadically) and an ultrasound was done (no lab work) and I was told nothing was wrong but I should stay off my feet and check with Perinatal. Perinatal wanted to see me 3-4 weeks. At 23 weeks pregnant I started having contractions every 1-3 minutes. I called the office when I was in the hospital and was told by Dr Graham's nurse that he would call me, well here it is two weeks later, I never received a call from Dr Graham. I did not want to be made as an example so I decided it was best for the health of my baby and I to switch to another obstetrician. I didn't like feeling like a dollar amount or ticket number. Nice doctor if he had time for his patients. I think patient care should mean more than money. I've had too many incidents to mention."

I called the office with mild spotting and was seen the next day. Dr. Graham came from the hospital after he did a surgery to see me. He spent a lot of time with me and never made me feel rushed. He repeated every thing to my husband as soon as he arrived from out of town, so it was actually like two visits in one. He is also going to preform a D&C on his day off the day before Thanksgiving. How many other doctors do that. He is compassionate, smart and the nurses at Northside Hospital call him the midwife doctor. He delivered m first child and my husband and I were so surprised how calm the whole event was. I know women waited for him today because of me getting squeezed in. I won't forget that and I will never go to another OB. I will understand that if I wait, it is because he took the time to really talk to a patient that got bad news. He is a rare doctor."

I am pregnant and typically wait 45 minutes to an hour before actually seeing Dr. Graham. This was also the case when I had an emergency visit. I am able to see Dr. Graham on average about 7 minutes. Dr. Graham's nurse is always in a hurry and does not provide time to answer questions during visits. She shows you to your exam room, checks the baby's heartrate and leaves. There is no way to talk to an actual person when you call this office. You have to leave a message and wait by your phone for a nurse to call you back.

Finally someone who I felt wasn't in a big hurry to move to the next person and actually seemed to care about what was going on with me. She is very knowledgeable and explained things to me and my husband in a way that we could understand. She even offered less invasive options first and gave us homework/research to due and to email to her. We are happy to have found her and I will definitely be coming back to her. She is trustworthy, respectful, and relateable. The only downside was the time, we had to wait a long time to see her, but that could be the price you pay to get personalized care.

I believe every woman should have a ""Dr.Sadler"" She is by far the best doctor I have ever had. As for the hospitals. Greater Laurel Hospital was great. Prince Georges was an awful experience.

As for the previous poster-- Dr. Sadler doesn't drink coffee and never has. She frequently tells me to avoid caffeine and has told me that she doesn't drink it either.

This woman is mean, arrogant and plain rude. Maybe she's just been doing it too long and she's burned out, but you don't deserve to pay the price for her frustration with the medical field. Plain and simple avoid Cynthia Sadler at all costs. She has horrible bedside manner, she is not educated nor up on current trends and treatments, and she's extremely rude. As in, she'll fight with you. She's extremely unprofessional. I obviously cannot say enough BAD things about this woman. Just stay away.

She was the only Doctor that took the time to find out what was causing my miscarriages and get me through a full pregnancy. Dr Sadler called at my home to make sure that I was following her instruction when it got near the time that I would usually Lose the baby. Dr. Sadler took care of me Like I was a family memeber. The service she provided me was impeccable. At one time when my insurance didn't cover me(because I was put on bedrest) I had to get the state help. Dr Sadler filled out the paper to accept DC State insurance so she could continue treating me. I wish that I could still be a patient of Dr. Sadler If she was still in practice.

It stressed me out too much. They used to have you call in for your test results, now they have you come in and pay yet another fee just to get your test results.

I asked about having another procedure done at the same time and during my consult, he picked up his cell phone and consulted with the other specialist to see if it was possible. He held my hand going into surgery and then asked if I'd like for him to pray with me! I can't tell you how much that eased my fears. I couldn't recommend this doctor - or his staff - any more highly. Even post-op and follow-up calls/questions have been dealt with professionally and with such kindness. I'm thankful I won't need another surgery thanks to Dr. Albee!"

I was in the delivery room when he delivered my nephew. It was then he suggested I come see him about my infertility issues. He found something that the other doctors had not discovered. I was pregnant thirty days after my first visit with Dr. Ulbrich. I had a planned c-section (medically necessary). I must say I was very impressed with my delivery and my recovery.

My birthing experience was so easy. It wasn't my ""birth plan"" but I am so glad he offered his advice and his suggestions. He has delivered many babies and knew a lot more than I did! So everything he suggested was to make giving birth as easy as possible for me and my baby. I appreciated that so much. When I got pregnant with my second child in 2012, he was the doctor I wanted and I was crushed to learn he no longer was doing obstetrics. My birthing experience with my second child was awful. Dr. Ulbrich definitely knew what he was doing. With my second child I had such a horrible experience with my doctors. They started pushing for a c-section before I even finished dilating and didn't listen to me when I tried explaining what I was feeling. I did have a c section, but I truly believe Dr. Ulbrich never would have let that happen. He was the BEST!!"

Based on the aggressive nature of the posts I would imagine his suspension was initiated by someone with a personal vendetta. It is a shame that our community, for a time lost such a truly gifted physician. He delivered all three of my children, high risks pregnancies and they were all amazing deliveries. As another person stated, almost timed to the minute. I have heard numerous other physician’s comment on his excellent surgical skills, one even saying ‘he has the best hands of any surgeon I’ve operated with’. As someone who had access to statistical outcomes at Piedmont Hospital, Dr. Ulbrich consistently had the lowest C-Section rates, the highest successful VBAC rates (vaginal birth’s after previous C-Section) and lowest surgical complication rates. Yes, he does practice progressive medicine. If you are looking for a holistic, natural, birth he may not be the physician for you."

Because I have been his patient since 2007 and know the entire history. People hate because he is successful and patients prefer his office over theirs. If you want a doctor who will trult care about your health and will treat you like you are the only patient, then Dr. Edmonds is for you.

Unfortunately I made the mistake of trusting her to have my best interest in mind. Definitely not the case. She injected me with the poison Depo Provera, never bothered to mention any of the possible side effects, or that it would linger in my body for 6+ months, or most importantly that there was no way to counter act it. I have been in excruciating pain in every muscle from the waist down (for over five months now) have lost half my hair and bleed for 6 weeks at a time!

I started crying out of the blue during an exam when she asked how I was feeling. I never cry in front of family or friends, so I surprised myself. Dr. Arkin just stood and held a kleenex box while I cried. Then she told me to call her in about 2 months if I still felt ""down"". That was it. A year later I returned for an exam,and she found a huge goiter. She referred me to her husband to have a biopsy. (THAT was a very scary appointment.) But my new doctor I learned that I have hypothyroidism. The crying a year later (depression) and early menopause are obvious symptoms. Dr. Arkin completely missed it. My new gynocologist said that Dr. Arkin should have helped diagnose this, & early menopause could have been stopped with synthroid. Plus she pushes estrogen in multiple forms."

Dr.Suarez told me twice I needed to sign my paperwork because he needed to leave. So needless to say many questions were left unanswered. He also did not take me anywhere private to cry, he left me in front of an audience of staring staff.

I am pregnant with my 4th child and have no doubt our birth experience will be amazing. I recently experienced an issue with an abnormal pap smear. Dr. Suarez helped me through this tough time by giving me all the facts. After my biopsy when he knew I was scared to death he was very understanding and comforting as well.

I was referred to her after my prior GYN missed the fibroids and the NP discovered them. Dr. Walters was very thorough. I decided to remain with her as my GYN. The prior reviews are accurate.
The receptionist is always warm and welcoming (Dunwoody Office), the nurses are hit and miss. Dr. Walters, blows in and out of the room like the wind. If you do not ask her directed questions, she WILL NOT take the time to discuss and will be out of the room before you can blink. I once arrived and was informed she left for the day. I requested Dr Paglione (sp?) because I left work and drove in traffic for the appointment. I LOVE Dr. Paglione (the two times Ive seen her). She is very thorough, offers additional tests to check ""Everything"" and spends the time with the patient. She knows about you as a patient (reads your chart) before walking into the room, unlike Dr Walters. Dr. Walters is very knowledgeable (without a doubt) but she falls short on so many other fronts.

The past few visits have been very rushed , she doesn't read the chart and assumes things that she could have read in the chart. She doesn't listen to concerns and is very dismissive to the point that it is rude. I decided maybe she was having a bad day and came back for another visit, she was offensive, judgemental, and dismissive.One of the worst healthcare provider visits i've ever had. The quality of her work has definitely decreased since the fame and there are way better OBGYNs in the area. "

She was my doctor for many years until I moved from Gwinnett to Paulding County. We would discuss my adopting because of infertility issues, but I didn't want to hear it....I felt with technology today, ""she could get me pregnant"". She had a heart to heart with me and now my husband, that caused me to consider it. It's now 2014, and I'm proud to say that we are the proud parents of 8.......yes 8 (5 boys and 3 girls) beautiful children. I never thought I would be here, and would like to share in the excitement with Dr. Jackie. ""Thank you "" for being the best OBGYN I have ever had, for being patient with me when I was being stubborn and for stepping out of your doctors coat and helping convince me to adopt.

It is a rare quality to find an absolutely brilliant physician with a wonderful bedside manner as well. And most importantly she is direct and respectful. Unlike most doctors, when she has bad news to deliver she does not beat around the bush or sugarcoat a situation with unnecessary pleasantries. She has seen me through several serious health issues over the years and several instances when I worried unnecessarily. Even in times where I had to page her after hours, she never expressed frustration, but always showed patience and reassurance. And ultimately, she always finds the right course of treatment. I trust her judgment completely - she is an absolutely wonderful doctor and wonderful person. Also, by the way parking is now only $3 and the waiting room time has been substantially shortened.

I've stuck with her for 5 years due to her knowledge, but am tired of spending a hour in the waiting room everytime I have an appointment. Everything, including the charts are electronic, which is nice. However, one day it all went down and I waited 2.5 hours to be seen. Another time, I waited over an hour and was told it would be another half hour or more before I would be seen, so I rescheduled. You have to park in a pay by 20 minutes parking deck and the stub the receptionist gave me to cover parking, didn't even cover it. Overall, good doctor, bad scheduling."

Also, he said that he didn't care if I ignore my cholesterol that it was my body. I am an adult and he should care. I care so why would he say such. I was only listening to what he had to say about my tests. Be careful how you talk to your patients."

I knowingly had fibroids going in for my first visit, and he and I discussed having them removed. I asked to get a partial hysterectomy to prevent from having them grow again and Dr. Hanafi agreed, discussed and explained the procedure. He made me feel comfortable and safe in his care. I'm now 2 weeks post Op, and I don't even feel like I had surgery. My recovery has been great, and I owe it all to him."

There is no reason why you should talk to people that work for you in a condescending manner. This is very off putting for a patient that wants to see the doctor. A little advice: change how you talk to people and maybe your staff wouldn’t change so often.

He immediately identified issues and answered questions with confidence , other doctors were hesitant, doubtful. He was very caring and passionate about helping me achieve my health and family goals no matter the odds. He is a God send in my life, his office manager worked well with him, hospital staff spoke highly of him and how accessible he is and prompt to visit, not making you wait hours to reach him. His videos of my operation were the cherry atop the cake. He knew from the beginning the issues these fibroids caused and encouraged me to remove them not to just leave them inside me as another doctor stated. Now, I can move forward without my health issues including inability to conceive. He facilitated God's miracle in me."

At first I trusted him based on the recommendation of a friend and his impressive credentials, but I now trust him because of the radical change that his skills in extracting endometriosis have made in my quality of life. He also suspected a serious hormonal imbalance and helped me to get life-changing care with a skilled endocrinologist, and he has been relentless in advising me on nutritional habits that would improve my treatment outcomes. He has his own ultrasound and hysteroscopy equipment, which is not only convenient but also has led to better outcomes since the procedure is conducted by him personally (as he is much more knowledgeable in guiding and interpreting the images). His office and insurance/billing staff have always been professional and helpful and his lead nurse is fantastic. I feel like Dr. Nezhat and his leading staff members know me and care about me. The wait is sometimes long, but I know it's because he is taking extra time when needed to meet the needs of other patients, as he has done with me on multiple occasions, so I don't mind. I am not wealthy, but I drive 16 round-trip hours or fly to Atlanta 1-3 times per year to see him, and I will continue to do so as long as I can because I believe I get the best possible care with Dr. Nezhat."

I was in labor and in the car to the hospital going to deliver my son vaginal breech with Dr. Tate at Emory Midtown Hospital. I transitioned through labor so quickly that Dr. Tate was not called in time to get there when I arrived, with baby's feet literally coming out while I was in the wheelchair on the way up to the delivery room. Dr. Horton has been trained in vaginal breech delivery and did not break a sweat when I presented in almost a state of shock! He helped deliver my footling breech baby boy healthy and strong, and I am blessed that he was standing outside the door of my L&D room. My son came 3 minutes after arriving to the hospital! If not for Dr.'s like Dr. Horton, who take the time to train in breech vaginal delivery...baby's like mine may have a very different outcome. Breech is usually an automatic cesarean largely due to inexperience of the OB in delivering them. Thank you Dr. Horton for being there for us!"

I unfortunately had 2 tests performed at the hospital. A Ct scan and an ultrasound. the ultrasound showed I had a large cyst but the CT did not. His office only had a copy of my CT. he proceeded to read my CT to me twice when I complained of pain and nausea these tests were also 2 weeks old so who knows how my cyst had progressed since then. all I knew was that I could feel it when I breathed and I had been laying with a heating pad every night. he did not treat me it seems because he had no proof of a cyst. I was in tears because of the pain and hopelessness I was feeling. if only I had the to show him. shame on this doctor for needing proof of pain and discomfort. I went to the hospital today and have my ultrasound in my hands. I plan on going to another obgyn on monday. I have never been treated this way by a doctor. it seemed as if he was more intested in getting home for the day then treating his patients.

I'm really, really opinionated about doctors because any kind of exam, no matter how non-invasive, really makes me nervous. Dr. Siegel puts you at ease instantly, she's nice, and she is a great listener. You won't find a better OB/GYN in Atlanta. The only reason the office got a 3 rating on punctuality is that I waited for an hour today for my appointment, which is rare.

I have been going to her for 5 years now, and have referred many friends to her who agree with my opinion. She has a wonderful bedside manner, & always takes the time to make sure all of your questions are answered. When I went in for a colposcopy/biopsy, she told me everything she was about to do before she did it, including telling me what it would feel like. She helped my best friend's through some fertility issues and then delivered her baby by C-section (there was a fibroid tumor involved), all the while, maintaining an excellent presence. You can really tell she cares about her patients."

Dr. Dawson is the most caring, involved OB/GYN I've ever been to. I actually enjoy or visits, and feel like he genuinely cares about his patients. Not only is he knowledgeable, he's very kind and easy to talk to. He makes sure to answer all your questions and leave you feeling well taken care of. He is almost always right on time and never rushes your appointment. His staff is helpful both in the office and when you need to call in about questions. No question is ""too stupid"" and they are prompt in their answers. They also have a wonderful online service that allows you to view all your medical records and test results. The only downfall is that the billing office is not very compassionate or willing to make payment arrangements. That being said, I once owed a lot of money but had an emergency situation and Dr. Dawson was kind enough to override them and allow me to come in regardless. Overall Dr. Dawson and his office get an A+ from me!"

He had an emergency but came out between appts to personally k give me a choice to wait or reschedule. I waited and received a thorough exam. He asks questions and seems very concerned about his patients. Its hard to find a good doc in atlanta where you dont feel like cattle in a herd. Plus he is from my home state which added to my comfort level. His staff is wonderful and his office is clean and elegantly tasteful. Im glad I found him.

Joffe,Atlanta,Georgia, Gynecologists (OBGYN) , Male,3,5,2009-07-16T12:47:27Z,5,5,5,5,5,"The office is wonderful, the staff is great and Dr. Joffe is very pleasant...However, he also has a consending tone when he talks to you, as if he putting you down. He does not listen to you when you talk he will cut you off mid sentence and he is too focus (to where he fades you out. He is knowledgable but he is also not up to par with the lastest techinques in medicine. Overall I give him 2 out of 5. I will not be returning as a patient. He is not what I am looking for in a MD."

Though I was her patient for several years, she did not ever tell me I had had fibroids (her nurse practitioner mentioned it in passing when it appeared I might have ovarian cancer). This doctor responded to my reservations about the surgery she wanted to perform with this statement : ""You'll never have children with THAT uterus."" She yelled this at me in the billing hallway of her office, where the office staff could hear her and while she was handing my chart to her billing clerk. What a cold and hostile doctor. When I asked her staff for a copy of my medical records, they said, ""no."" It took one month, and persisting despite rude office staff, to get my records. This doctor negatively affected my health."

If you want an honest and upfront doctor, she's it. She doesn't sugar coat the conversation or brush you off to being ""hormonal"". She is the only doctor I trusted to do more than one and major surgeries. I have received excellent care and advice from her every time I visit. I have had to wait a long time occasionally but she is worth it. She keeps up to date with new studies and discoveries. She is easy to talk to about uncomfortable topics and always offers suggestions or just listens. She watched out for me when I was in the hospital for a hysterectomy and responded quickly when I needed her. If she wasn't available on the weekends afterwards, she has a great group of doctors that were there for me and responded quickly as well. I now drive a long way just to see Dr. Croft. I won't be changing doctors unless she retires one day. She is great in my eyes!"

She is blunt, but in a friendly way. She has diagnosed several issues with me and was correct each time, as evidenced by quick successful treatment. She was able to diagnose something my internist could not. She is open and will answer any question, no matter how personal, with frank response and no judgement. I like her and would recommend her to anyone."

The second time I was having severe pelvic pain. She did a quick (less than a minute) exam and ordered an ultrasound. She left town with no direction other than everything was normal. She didn’t recommend any course of action or any other doctor; she left me to fend for myself and determine where to go on my own. Within the next several days I was in extreme pain and bleeding. She has a horrible bedside manner, was rude and condescending both times I saw her, has an attitude of superiority and seems to enjoy flaunting it. I will never go back to her or be treated in such a disrespectful manner. If you are looking for a caring, compassionate doctor who will work with you to solve the problem or refer you to a competent doctor, then I cannot recommend Dr. Croft."

I went for a birth control consultation, and when discussing my options Dr. Soorena Fatehchehr made some interesting comments. I was on a birth control a few years ago and it had some major negative psychological effects on me, and when I told him of this he told me ""all 15 year olds are suicidal."" Further into the conversation he stated that the pill may make you gain weight, and that he tells his patients to ""just eat salad every time they're hungry."" He REALLY pushes the pill, and is unopen to discussion about ANY other option. According to the Resident Bios at OU.EDU he graduated from medical school in Tehran, Iran."

He is an excellent, caring and very knowledgeable doctor! I've suffered with endometriosis for years and he's the only doctor who has been able to help me and see me through two successful and pain free pregnancies.

He's delivered all three of my children and I am now accompanying my daughter to her OB visits with him. He delivered her and now he's going to deliver my granddaughter.

Due to the office negligence we have had to come out of pocket $1500 for expenses that were undue and did not go toward deductibles for our plan or costs of birth. We had not information provided for diet, medical needs or assistance for gestational diabetes even when we asked for it.
Dr. Blank was lovely and gracious despite his lack of awareness of his own office, staff and our diabetic needs for monitoring and referrals for a specialist. We switched doctors to receive better care by another staff and found peace of mind in the care of someone else. All in all it was a terrible experience with a rude and Ill equipt staff. "

He always has free samples of my prescription so I don't have to pay for the first few months, which is awesome. He is doing a simple study in which I received $50.00 cash after participating. I have spontaneous health issues that like to pop up without any warning. In the past this has left me to finding a clinic somewhere that will take me or worst case scenario, going to the ER for a prescription. When I called his office fearful that it would end up like all of my other dr, his nurses made sure I was seen immediate. It was effing great!"

He delivered my second son about three years ago, via c-section. Four weeks after having my son, I learned I had a DVT and a pulmonary embolism. Having to go back to the hospital after trying to recover from my c-section, I notified Dr. Blank, since I felt I was still under his care. As well learning that I had this misfortune from the c-section. He never came to check on me, nor call to see how I was. Rather he waited to see me weeks later at my check up. He seemed more worried about himself, then my well being. I remind you that my first son's delivery was perfect. Not happy, nor ever going back!!!"

He is just the most caring, personable and professional doctor I've ever met! There have been times when I was worred about something and had to call him at night. He always makes me feel that my concerns are valid, puts my mind to rest - or if he feels I need immediate attention either meets me at the ER if it's at night or tells me to call the office first thing in the morning to make an appt - whenever I call, his staff already knows to expect my call and has an appointment waiting for me. Also, if I am seen for a problem, Dr Blank always calls me the next day to see how I am doing - and this is on weekends too!

She will agree to run the test(s) you want, but she does it with such an attitude. She is not the nicest person; she starts off nice, but quickly turns on you and makes you feel unwelcome if you have questions and make any mention of something you read on the internet."

She is so knowledgeable and is very good at explaing things so that even people wihtout medical knowledge can understand. I learned more from working with her than I ever did in school. She has an amazing undertsnding for the different ways that people live there lives and as a patient you can talk to her and know she will never judge. She can give you insight to much much more than GYN related problems. I will recommend her to every person that is looking for and amazing doctor because she is just that.

Up until last year I had no complaints, but last year I called three different times. I would start at 9am and would get a busy signal all day. I called repeatedly throughout the day and never got through. I have known ladies who worked in doctor's offices that would take the phones off the hook and I was starting to think that was the case. I did finally get through after many days of calling non-stop. Well, a year later and I am getting the same busy signal. I tried all day non-stop. I finally got through a day later right at 9am. I told the girl I needed an urgent appointment and she transferred me to the nurses line without making an appointment. As of 2:00 no one has called me back and guess what? I have tried calling back and all I get is a busy signal. I really like Dr. Clemens, but the staff needs an overhaul."

I really like her and felt the care throughout my pregnancy through my delivery and follow up was excellent. My husband and I both asked a LOT of questions during our appointments and she always took the time to answer all our questions thoroughly. I have been seen by all the doctors in the practice at least once, a couple times for very scary/upsetting reasons, and have been very impressed by each of their professionalism and compassion. I highly recommend this practice to friends regularly."

I have seen her for several years and have always found her to be kind and caring and knowledgeable. She did an endometrial ablation on me and I was very nervous ahead of time and she explained the procedure thoroughly, what my other options were, etc. I wish there were more doctors like her out there. Most of them seem to see their patients as a bother. Not Dr. Adams. Any time I've left a message for her to call because I have had a question (which is not often) she has returned my call and answered my question."

She's totally down to earth, practices ""better safe than sorry"" medicine and very knowledgeable. She is very comforting and doesn't rush thru the appointment like some doctors do.

Dr. Adams interacted with me like the entire time she spent in medical school (and you know where she went right?) she has never heard of Endometriosis or Interstitial Cystitis. Actually, this woman had me convinced that those two very common conditions were foreign to her. She made comments such as""some people do have very painful periods and that is normal"" and ""there's no point in looking into this further because I don't see anything wrong with you"" when clearly I exibited symptoms of someone in distress. Someone mentioned earlier and that review was deleted that her hick accent is annoying but in all honesty, the accent can get under your skin if you're already frustrated. Not recommended."

She delivered my third child and she is by far the best obstetrician I have seen. Always very interested in me and very complete when answering any questions. I was very sad to learn that she has left the Philadelphia area when I called for yearly exam.

I came to her for a complicated Gyn problem after seeing several other gynecologists that I was disappointed with. Dr. Adams was extremely helpful, compassionate, and knowledgeable. She took a lot of time with me and had a very comforting,caring bedside manner. She has always gotten back to me with results or follow up right away. I think she is terrific and I am extremely grateful for all she has done for me. I have sent my sister, my mother, and one of my good friends to her. They all think she is fabulous and feel she gives them excellent care and a lot of attention. Therefore, I could not believe it when I saw that someone wrote something negative about Dr. Adams. All the patients that she sees that I know love her and are so glad to have found her. I recommend her highly and without any reservations."

Adams,Atlanta,Georgia, Gynecologists (OBGYN) , Female,11,4.19,2006-08-17T09:28:29Z,4.7,,4,5,5,It is sad to see that Dr. Adams is being judged on her expertise because she merely did not regurgitate the bombastic advice from google... Doctors are not there to teach you the process of inflammation and its consequences in a particular ailment in one session (which took them several years to learn during medical school;) they have to think about all the possible 'safe' treatments before giving a solid advice. And rating a doc by her accent is preposterous. I would much rather go to a doctor who is knowledgable than someone who is elquent but lacks proper diagnosis. My experience with Dr. Adams before and after my pregnancy was nothing short of magnificent. She went out of her way to find out in detail what topical creams I could or could not continue to use during pregnancy (my dermatologist had cautioned against all use and I was extremely uncomfortable.)

Adams,Atlanta,Georgia, Gynecologists (OBGYN) , Female,11,4.19,2006-02-27T20:59:43Z,1,,1,1,1,"I agree that accents are not important here because having a Southern accent doesn't make you less qualified as a doctor. Unfortunately in Dr. Adam's case, it doesn't help either. My first visit with her was dissapointing and I don't think I'm going back to that office again. First of all, she was 45 minutes late and the front desk just kept saying that ""she's been running behind all day"", which didn't exactly make me feel any better. It just means that I wasn't the only one that day that had to wait endlessly to be seen for 10 minutes. Here's the worst part, when finally seen, Dr. Adams did not apologize for keeping me waiting for almost an hour. Talk about bad first impression. I also felt very rushed through out the whole process. I expected to talk in her office for at least 10 minutes since I was a new patient but she wasn't interested in me, just asked some very basic queestions, such as if I'm on birth control, etc. I agree that she wasn't warm and fuzzy. Just sort of impersonal."

I was actually told by that particular MD that it was in my head. I finally made the switch to Dr. Gumer. He said, ""If you say you have pain, then you have pain. We will work together to find the problem."" He worked, and did find the problem...Endometriosis! For years, I suffered because I had a Dr. that didn't believe my pain. I found Dr. Gumer, and everything changed for me. He is awesome! You won't go wrong with Dr. Gumer!!"

As the signs in the office explain, these doctors run on baby time, so on occasion I had to wait longer while Dr. Creed was dashing between the office and neighboring Northside Hospital. However, my overall experience as a first time mom who had to have a medically necessary c-section was exceptional. Dr. Creed was professional, knowledgable, and a brilliant surgeon. She is also kind, patient, and caring.

She is extremely thorough assisting me with my pregnancy. One thing I am very happy with is that she doesn't rush appointments and spends the time to make sure you understand options. They don't make you feel stupid for asking questions which is appreciated. I also like that they have the ultra sound there at their office and the blood work is also in the same office/ next door.

If you have alot of problems, or are high risk, and have to call the nurse or her often, or have to come in and get checked, she has an attitude. Like it's your fault, or you are bothering her. Her nurse Danielle is the same way, the more they have to deal with you, the more of an attitude they have with you. The problems I have had are excessive bleeding, high blood pressure,etc. Aren't you supposed to call when these issues arise?? it's to the point now when the nurse calls me back she doesn't say a word to me, she runs me into the room, takes my blood pressure and leaves. when Karen comes in, she talks really fast runs through her ""check list"" of questions,and says I will see you in 4 weeks. the last visit I timed was 45 secs. The other issue I have with her is when I told her I was having heart palpitations, blurred vision, and dizzy spells she told me to go home and drink water. looking for a new dr"

I am 32 weeks pregnant with my second baby and have a low risk pregnancy. I have been receiving all prenatal care and a labor and delivery nurse myself. Decided to switch to his practice because heard good things about him and wanted to deliver at northside where my current provider didn't deliver there. Anyway, called to schedule an appointment and was greeted over the phone by a very rude receptionist, who when found out that I am 32 weeks, said she needed to go talk to the doc. I very nicely explained to her that I have all prenatal care and low risk pregnancy. She came back after talking to the doc and said he doesn't accept patients after 30 weeks, what????? Liability, what???? Can you read charts and records from before? Sounded like a crazy discrimination to me , but she said it is his policy. Pretty upsetting to me- what a waist of time

Moore,North Atlanta,Georgia, Gynecologists (OBGYN) , Male,13,3.33,2014-04-12T17:21:22Z,1,1,1,1,1,"My husband and I recently started trying to conceive so I was looking for a new doctor that could be with me through my pregnancy. I was taken to his office and waited about 30 min for him to even come in. Once we started talking I quickly realized that he is very arrogant and dismissive. There is a difference between being blunt and being completely presumptuous and superficial. Everything I said, he countered with IVF at ACRM (fertility clinic), even though nothing about my prior medical history even hinted that we wouldn't be able to conceive on our own. He was selling them REALLY hard, it almost felt like he worked for them not his own practice. I left there swearing I would never return. I found another doctor who takes his time and does not unnecessarily freak healthy people out with an irrelevant doom and gloom attitude. Most reviews are from pregnant people so maybe he is better with them but thank god I won't ever return to find out. Stay away, horrid bedside manner."

It was a high risk pregnancy and he took all the necessary precautions. I would highly recommend his services."

Dr. Moore is very rude and he doesn't treat his patients right. I had a very bad experience with Dr. Moore. I wanted to talk to him about my condition, but he ignored me, he wouldn't listen to me. I was discarded from the clinic by his nurse. Not a good place.STAY AWAY!!!"

Moore,North Atlanta,Georgia, Gynecologists (OBGYN) , Male,13,3.33,2011-10-26T08:48:35Z,4.8,4,5,5,5,"Dr. Moore has been my OB for more than 9 years, I have also refered him to my family and friends as well. He has always been kind, open and considerate when it comes to my health. He is very open minded and does not come across as a no it all and when he doesnt know he states that fact and he will research and call you back. Dr. Moore has performed my tubaligation, partial hysto, uterine oblation and delivered my son and nephew, all with no complications and great bed side manner. AWESOME guy & GREAT doctor."

Moore,North Atlanta,Georgia, Gynecologists (OBGYN) , Male,13,3.33,2011-05-04T07:18:02Z,2,2,2,2,2,"With all the comments I was expecting an outstanding experience but when I got there I was disappointed. I saw a nurse who knowledgeable but seem young with no common since not very experienced. I went there to get medication and left with none and my answers were not answered. I wanted to know out my body and having children and she was more focused on my situation with my mate. I didn’t feel comfortable, safe or like ne one really cared about me (everyone seems robotic, like they were just at work and really didn’t want to be there). I wasn’t impress with the location (kind of looked like a jail from the outside) but inside it was nice and clean. I moved from Smyrna to Dunwoody and wanted something closer to were I stay but I think that my comfort is worth the drive so I will continue to work with the doctor I had before"

He is the only doctor who helped me with my frequent yeast infections. I moved and have to drive a bit to see him, but well worth it."

You will have to remind him of things and stay on top of somethings. Overall, he is very kind and is knowledgable. It's been a little bit since I was last there, however, at the time, 1 receptionist was rude. The rest of the staff was very nice."

Moore,North Atlanta,Georgia, Gynecologists (OBGYN) , Male,13,3.33,2009-01-28T13:25:08Z,5,5,5,5,5,"He is a wonderfull doctor he knwos his practice very well he had treated my two pregnancys he takes the time to answer your question in the visits also you can do the lab test in his office which is clean and the staff is always nice, I deliver on the Northside Hospital a excelent hospital and Dr Moore is always on time! I like how he treat people and the nurses on the hospital said to me the he is a good doctor!"

Moore,North Atlanta,Georgia, Gynecologists (OBGYN) , Male,13,3.33,2008-09-17T17:05:26Z,5,5,5,5,5,I love this guy - he knows his stuff and always takes time to explain everything to you to make you feel comfortable. You will not feel rushed and his staff is great too! He is excellent and his location is far for me but well worth the drive to know I am in such great hands. He is always referencing the latest studies which is quite refreshing since most docs tend to not keep up on all the latest studies out there. He is funny too. A great experience.
1985,Dr. Sharon A. Bent-Harley,Atlanta,Georgia, Gynecologists (OBGYN) , Female,13,3.31,2017-03-17T17:48:27.739Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Alway great personal service from staff and Doctors . Dr. Harley has been my physician since 2005, as a OBGYN from my insurance plan. I was her first patient for bio-identical hormones. Walked into her office with a Susan Summers book and she had just attended a convention for medial doctors on the same topic! Very synchronistic in all ways! Love her office and staff!"

In the beginning, the wait was long, however, what I learned was that she took the time to talk to her patients, including me. I just took a book to read and time went by pretty quickly. I don't mind waiting because Dr. Harley took care of my menopausal issues and is extremely knowledgeable on the subject."
1987,Dr. Sharon A. Bent-Harley,Atlanta,Georgia, Gynecologists (OBGYN) , Female,13,3.31,2012-03-29T15:32:05Z,1.5,2,1,2,1,"Very expensive. 500.00 a visit. Staff knowledge is poor at best. Supplements are very expensive. Pellets at times does not work! Can't get a call back. Can't furnish a bill at time of service, they want cash payments. Can't get information on dosage of pellets or directions on supplements."
1988,Dr. Sharon A. Bent-Harley,Atlanta,Georgia, Gynecologists (OBGYN) , Female,13,3.31,2011-07-14T11:57:36Z,1,1,1,1,1,"After searching high and low for a good doctor, I found Dr. Harley's name came up a lot and some people even told me about her. So I made an appt. I asked very specific questions prior to making the appt and then the day came. I left work early and arrived early since I was a new patient. When I got to the office, it looked old, moldy and out-dated, but I proceeded to sign in. I was given a form to fill out as a new patient. After waiting over an hour, I went back to the front desk. Shortly I was called to the back. After speaking to the docotor, they told me that they don't accept high risk patients. As I was being dismissed, with no services complete, I began to ask more probing questions. That doctor then told me to wait while she consulted with the other doctors. The end result was, after the practice discussed my condition, then would not be able to see me as a patient. What a waste. I will never go back there or refer anyone to them. If I so much as here her name I am disgusted."

I am 20 years old and Dr. Harley delivered me and my two older sisters one is 26 years old and the other 23 years old. Still to this day we all go to Dr. Harley, my mother still goes to. She also delivered my oldest sister child. Dr. Sharon Bent-Harley and her staff are wonderful. I wouldn't go to anybody else but her."

I experienced CHRONIC INSOMNIA due to perimenopause and it took 3 months to find Dr. Harley. After being told by other doctors that I was depressed and throwing pharmaceutical drugs at me, I found this practice to be professional and expert at hormone therapy using bioidentical hormones. Dr. Harley and staff listened to my symptoms and immediately began to balance me. I started with her in December, 2009 and I would say I am 85% July, 2010)and looking forward to getting my LIFE back! They are the BEST in Atlanta. All gynecologists DO NOT know hormones! Dr. Harley and staff are experts!"

Bent-Harley,Atlanta,Georgia, Gynecologists (OBGYN) , Female,13,3.31,2010-04-09T13:34:31Z,2.3,3,1,2,3,Maybe she's too busy but I waited for an hour and paid her $200+ dollars for a consultation that was only 10 minutes and she seemed irritated when I told her that I didn't appreciate it.
1992,Dr. Sharon A. Bent-Harley,Atlanta,Georgia, Gynecologists (OBGYN) , Female,13,3.31,2010-02-09T09:16:25Z,3.8,4,1,5,5,"I have been a patient of Dr. Harley since 1994. She is very knowledgeable and has superb bedside manner. She delivered my 2 daughters-both on her days off because I specifically wanted her. The staff have always been extremely friendly and helpful to me. She is one of the few ob/gyn's who takes interest in women's health AFTER childbearing years and educates you on what to expect and how to prepare for menopause. My overall health has improved because of Dr. Harley and although her office punctuality is very poor, I find her well worth the wait."

I had a hysterectomy performed may 2004. She did a partial and never ruled out endometriosis since i was having pain and bleeding. After misdiagnosing me, her and her staff began to treat me bad then told me she no longer accepted my insurance. i went years in pain to find out i had a endometrioma that blocked my ureter and killed my right kidney. Now the endometriosis is on the only kidney I have left and all I see in the future is my dealth and to leave my 5 children unsupported. She IS WALKING AROUND HAPPY AND PAID FROM HER MILLIONS OF SURGERIES. I JUST WISHED SHE CARED ENOUGH ABOUT ME AND MY FAMILY TO AT LEAST SAY ""I'M SORRY.My kids don't have a future without a mother. I just wish she had treated me how she would have wanted to be treated as a patient. I don't know what my future holds but pain at this point until I am gone..... Just thought somebody should know.....You are nothing to this lady but a paycheck........."

I just wish her office ran as well. Her staff are nice people but they miss follow-up calls and somehow instructions from the doctor don't always get done. Her office needs a good cleaning both in the waiting areas and the exam rooms (dust, unmopped floors). And the wait is horrendous! I have watched entire tv shows in the lobby (before they took the TV out in favor of a looped video for their skin care services) and taken naps in the exam rooms -- both on a regular basis. I believe the doctor is overbooked and often seems tired when she comes to the exam and sometimes does not take the time to listen or assumes things. Maybe the latter is because she's been doing this for a long time but it does nothing to help with communication. Again, I appreciate her work in the operation room but I can do without everything else."
1995,Dr. Thomas L. Lyons,Atlanta,Georgia, Gynecologists (OBGYN) , Male,7,3.68,2015-07-26T01:38:03.946Z,2.8,3,3,2,3,"great pre surgery, did shurex procedure wrong, pain and problems since 2004. very dismissive after..borderline rude......"

He immediately addressed my endometriosis pain and constant bleeding. His office nurse, Cheryl Spencer was SO SWEET, I loved her! Surgery was scheduled and everything went well. I felt great and had no issues for about 2 years. After that, I experienced constant bleeding. I visited his office NUMEROUS times with the same complaints. He prescribed me medication that didn't help, said that perhaps my Mirena was causing bleeding my irritating the walls of my uterus (although I had already had it for many years without that ever being an issue) and then told me ""well, you can either not be in pain or you can bleed. It will never be both apparently."" Being a 25 year old woman, constant pain and bleeding was devastating to my active lifestyle. Eventually, I did my research and found a doctor that directly addressed and fixed all of my issues with another surgery. He even diagnosed me with Adenomyosis, something Lyons never even suggested.
While I think he is a great doctor, I am really disappointed with how dismissive he became. He made me feel like I was an annoyance and that I would forever have to live my life with these issues.
If you are in suffering from any gynecological issues, PLEASE check out Dr. Ken Sinervo! He is right next door to Dr. Lyons and totally changed my life!"

I stayed in the hospital for a week was sent home with a fever.. Called Dr Lyons told him I was still sick he told me to come in to his office. Gave me fluids in the back of his office. Sent me back he home .... 4 days later went back to northside. They immediately put me in ICU.... And called Infectious disease Dr.... Dr Lyons almost killed me.. Was in hospital 6 weeks with 3 drain tubes hanging off my sides.... I should have sued..... ladies STAY AWAY..........

He did not perform the correct surgery & at the last minute ADDED a procedure that I did NOT want... and he knew this. Also, he will NOT PRESCRIBE PAIN MEDICATIONS. To him a hysterectomy does not produce pain. If I could sue him I would .... but have thought about it. My primary dr. had to prescribe pain meds. He must HATE WOMEN. Worst yet, I still have my same problem & am in the process of another surgery."

I had his Laparoscopic Supracervical Hysterectomy (minimally invasive, spares the cervix as keystone support for female anatomy) on a Friday, and by Tuesday I was able to go out to lunch and dinner with friends, also walk a mile and do Tai Chi. He is an extraordinary man and compassionate practitioner. Women come to him from around the world for the minimally invasive procedures he has developed."

The doctor is extremely knowledgeable, patient, and compassionate. He takes the necessary time to explain all procedures and tests in as much detail as is required. I traveled from out of state to see this physician, and I wouldn't hesitate to do so again should I require additional care! My recovery was uneventful, and the office staff stayed in full contact with me during my recovery."

Very caring, attentive, knowledgeable doctor. He takes time to answer your questions and he listens. If you are looking for an OB, he has retired from that area, however he is a great GYN."

His staff isn't the best but anytime I complain about one he has handled it. I feel more like a family member than a patient with him. I am ill and have to see many doctors, he is the only one I feel comfortable with. He listens to my concerns even if it isn't OB related. He works with ALL my other doctors to make sure everyone is on the same page. He makes himself available to me for emergency. I wouldn't change him for anything. He saved my babies life when the Emergency Room want to give me a DNC. They told me I miscarried and I signed all the papers to basically have an abortion. I called him and he made some demands for different test. Come to find out my baby was alive. I almost lost him but thanks to this doc for going the extra mile, he is here with me now (3 years later)."

Williams,Atlanta,Georgia, Gynecologists (OBGYN) , Male,5,3.33,2006-12-01T17:03:56Z,1,,1,1,1,"After waiting a couple of hours for the doctor and playing how much longer do you think it's going to be with all the other patients in the lobby, 2 hours later, I finally had the chance to see him, I was not impressed. As for the receptionist, she didn't seem too thrill to be at her job this particular day and neither were any of the other office personel members. This was a routine annual check and I must say the doctor was very friendly and maybe a little too friendly. He asked questions that were not necessarily concerning my medical needs, and he did a lot of complimenting (He commented on everything from my hairstyle to my panty hose). Considering what a gynecologist does, this made me very uncomfortable. Unless you're looking for a date or a cheap thrill, find yourself a REAL doctor - one with good bedside MANNERS."

My regular doctor was unavailable for a procedure I was very nervous about and I met Dr. V for the first time in the hospital. She immediately assuaged my fears with her calm and poise.

He did not visit me in the hospital until the fourth day when I was discharged. I was an OB nurse and my husband was a dentist. I expected better medical care than this.

I was a little concerned since the doctor I went to the previous year did not recommend it as well (I relocated for a year for my job). I let him do the procedure and it was the worst experience I have had yet. He also recommended that I come back in six months and have this procedure again which I did not. This year I was concerned about having my annual. I decided to go to another doctor since I questioned Dr. Ehrlich recommendation the previous year. I shared my concern and showed him my records. He reviewed the records and said that I would not need another colposcopy unless the count was higher. He said that he would not have done the first one. This confirmed my suspicion about Dr. Ehrlich. Because of this experience, I would not recommend him."

I had two horrible GYN docs, before I started seeing DR Erlic 7 years ago. He has a great deal of knowledge and dosent play guessing games.

I switched to him from a multi-doctor practice when I found out I was pregnant. Then when we found out we were having twins we were extremely grateful for having switched - as he has delivered many twins and at least several triplets. He was open to natural childbirth, and did not push a C-section on me just because of the twins. He has a great demeanor - and sense of humor."

(Perhaps they are just cautious since 80% of patients are pregnant, on/off pill and going through change too many hormones to deal with). I arrived 15 min early, and was taken back to start process immediatly. Its almost a factory, 4 triage booths where you get your BP, history, urine sample, iron check. Then you go to a back waiting area while Dr looks at your records. Then a small exam room for actual exam, less than 10 min with Dr. but no concerns to talk about so OK. It is very slick and efficient, not a lot of chit chat and hand holding, but adequate. I will stay with that practice. They get you through the process in record time. If you would rather be seen on time and get in and out, this is the Doc for you. Also they have most equipment required...Bone density screener, sonography equip, perform urine & blood test on premisis."

I liked his personality, liked his directness & felt like he was not rushing me and wanted to make sure I had all my questions answered. A lot of times when you are going thru the prenatal visits & rotating thru the practice, all the doc wants to do is check you off the list, listen to the heartbeat & move you along. That is absolutely not the case with Dr. Bodner. If I can't have my usual OB/GYN for my next delivery, I would happily have Dr. Bodner deliver my child.

I always complained about pelvic pain, but medications usually worked. The pain was getting worse, so I was calling him more. He told me I only wanted to have my belly cut open. He did not feel anything was wrong and he told me all women are hypochondriacs. Ultimately, I switched MDs and it was later found I had severe (Stage IV) Endometriosis! I also had a family history of Endo, so he should have listened more carefully to what I was saying. Further, if he feels all women are hypochondriacs, then he needs to find another area of practice! I partially blame myself for taking so long to be diagnosed because I stayed under his care. I found a GYN who cared enough to help me and BELIEVE me!"

I was a high risk pregnant with polyhydromnia, he always said everything is fine, until I lost my baby in my six month of pregnancy. After 6 month I was ready to try to get pregnant again. I start having a cyst with a lot of pain, they ultrasound me three times for three month having pain, he still said everything is fine! Since I lost my right ovary three years ago, I can't afford to loose another one Ame this new cyst is a big concern for me. Last Sunday I had to go to emergency room because of a bad pain and they called his office. Nobody called me on Monday so I had to call the nurse for follow up. She said I have to send my ER lab and ultrasound results for them to review! I wanted to seethe Dr and follow up with him, so I personally went to the office and took my results with me. The nurse wasn't available so I talked to the supervisor. She promised the nurse is going to contact me by the end of the day, but she never did! I had another pain episode that night, it was so bad that I was about to go to ER again. I prefer to see the Dr next day. I walked in to the office Wednesday morning saw the supervisor again. She said I cannot see the Dr and my nurse is going to call them. I was so angry, nobody cares what is going on. I have a cyst, I have pain, I have one ovary left and I am trying to get pregnant, but I feel I am being ignored and they don't care. I decided to change my dr and I even told the supervisor. She said I should get a call from either the nurse or herself anyway. I recieved the call with the funniest message from my nurse! She said Dr Garcia reaviued my results and base on the info I have to have another ultra sound in 6-8 weeks. That mean I can't able to read the last page of my results my self, and also means he didn't bothered himself to see what is going on with me, and I need to suffer with this pain for another 6-8 month. What a waist of time, even a first grade kid could read that part and tell the same thing to me!"

This doctor will say all you like to hear during your obstetrical office visits and then leaves it to the nurse to deliver your baby, not even showing up after their repeated calls. If you have never heard of fecal incontinence as I was, read up about it and then ask Dr. Garcia how many of his patients have ended up with it.

I did nothing strenuous and two weeks later I was back in the hospital fighting an enormous infection in my abdomen because my incision had opened. When I went to Dr. Garcia-Saul before the hospital, he simply put a band-aid on it and said it was nothing to worry about. Next day I was having a seizure from a 104 degree fever and had to be rushed to the ER. This doctor is incompetent and irresponsible. I would highly recommend nobody uses him as their OBGYN."

I had been suffering with pelvic and bladder prolapse for over a year. I finally feel like I have gotten my life back. I did my research before selecting a surgeon. She was highly reccommended by my gynecology group and other physicians with whom I confer. I am a pharmacist myself and know that there are questionable physicians that practice. On my recent annual exam my gynecologist informed me that my results from my surgery were excellent.

Not many doctors will actually take the time to sit with you in their office AFTER your annual exam and go over everything, take the time to answer any questions you have, etc. She also introduced me to bio-identical hormones for post-menopausal symptoms before many of my friends' doctors even knew about them. She is very professional and business-like, perhaps that is what people are mistaking for being condescending, but I've never gotten that feeling from her--and believe me, I'm the kind of patient who asks lots of questions at times and could drive a doctor a little crazy!

When I found I needed a hysterectomy, I traveled to see her for a second opinion. She took the time to discuss various options with me, even though I was technically no longer her patient. I ended up choosing to have the surgery done by her in Atlanta because my insurance covered it, and it was one of the very best decisions of my life! Unlike what I was advised in Birmingham, Dr. Kleiss was able to do the surgery noninvasively and did not insist on removing my ovaries. I literally experienced no pain after the surgery in the hospital and also during my recovery at home. (I didn't even need to take aspirin, let alone heavy-duty pain meds!) Because the surgery was noninvasive, I was driving in a week and back at work in two weeks. I credit Dr. Keiss's skills as a surgeon and her willingness to explore every surgical option (not just the timesaving ones) with this amazingly positive outcome. She is the best!"

I never had any major issues thus I wouldn't say that I 'tested her knowledge' that much. Scheduling yearly visits, though, would sometimes be difficult since she seemed to have a 1 - 2 month lead time."

She is so sweet and makes you feel extremely comfortable. I would be so upset if I ever had to leave her practice. The nurses are very professional and nice as well. They do run a bit behind but I believe that is because she is not rushed. She wants to hear what you have to say and answer any questions.

I was having some issues, and she completely blew me off multiple times. Finally I asked her to culture anyway, and of course she found what I told her was there all along! Biggest waste of time. Horrible doctor. I have told everyone I know not to see her."

He was my doctor for the ten years I was in GA and I couldn't imagine a better Doctor. He is very knowledgable and kind. He has 3 locations and is always available. He also does procedures at Northside which is a very good hospital. At first I was a little hesitant about seeing a male gynecologist but within the first 5 minutes of meeting him I was at ease. He is a great doctor and I was very lucky to have had him as mine.

Bassil,Suwanee,Georgia, Gynecologists (OBGYN) , Male,3,4.17,2014-06-24T13:40:26Z,3.3,5,4,2,2,"My primary reason for seeing Dr. Bassil was for pain that started 8 months after myomectomy surgery performed by another doctor. I was seeking a second opinion and possibly treatment. According to the Clinical Supervisor, copies of my post op reports were received. During my appointment, he said he didn't have the records. These were needed for his opinion. He gave his opinion for the GI related issues. However, I left the office without answers to my main question... the sharp pelvic pain. Two weeks later, the pain worsened. I called his office. For 3 days, the Clinical Supervisor requested him to contact me. He finally responded and left a long voicemail not addressing the pain. Sadly, he wasn't being truthful by stating that he called a week ago. When I called back, as requested by him if needed, there was no response. Since then, another doctor said she believes this could be scar tissue forming after my surgery. Dr. Bassil is a healthcare professional. He acted irresponsibly."

Jennifer Aqua was average, but I was impressed with their all women practice. however, when I returned I had a mix up with my new insurance card and it took months for me to finally get reimbursed for having to pay for that office visit out of pocket. I called several times before getting a response and the problem was resolved. when I called today to make my annual exam appointment, I had to call 8 times until I got someone on the line. when I got the young lady, we spoke long enough for her to put me on hold. I was on hold for 10 minutes and then got transferred to the answering service. I am done. surely there is better care available in Atlanta and I will find it."

However my problem is she does not return your calls. She will have her staff respond to you. I needed to speak to her and called several times, and each time she blew me off to her staff. The staff was nice, but I am paying her for care not them. This is a deal breaker when you pay so much money for a doctor, and this says a lot about your doctor. I want to be treated like a patient not a number."

I have had at least 12 different OB GYN's during my two pregnancies and moves across the country. I was with this practice and had another great Doctor who retired. Then, I was assigned a different doctor ( whom I did not like) and finally I met Dr. Aqua. She is wonderful! The only sad part is that I visit with her once per year for my check ups and she is always on top of things... I do not know how she can recall tidbits about everyone's life so readily!

I came in 15 mins before my appointment 15 mins early and had to wait a whole an hour and 15 mins. I told the nurse that I am in a rush because I have to be back on time to pick up my kids at school bus stop. I was told I am free to leave. When Dr. Yvette Smith came in, I told her that I am not very happy that I had to wait for this long. Without any sign that she feels there is anything wrong with letting your patient / customer waiting for over an hour, She said "" You could have left"". I told her that i will definitely leave them for good after this. She then performed a cursory exam and pap smear in total silence without asking anything about my concerns / any other question. The lack of empathy or any care for their patients is appalling! This is the worst quality medical service I have ever received. I requested my medical records to be sent to my home and run.. I suggest that you do the same!!"

Furthermore, she will order absolutely unnessesary tests that have no medical indication for you and threaten you and twist it to say that she is looking out for the baby that you need to have a test done. For a test that could have been easily done in her office for free to me, she had me come to the hospital on the weekend when she was on call--she did not tell me that I would be admitted to the hospital and therefore incur a HUGE bill for a simple non-stress test (I was not even 41 weeks pregnant and everything was normal). Furthermore, two days later, I had to come back to the office and take the same test with a sonogram even though Saturday's test was normal...so then I tried to ask her why the saturday test was even necessary and she wouldn't return my calls--she only had the billing office at her office call me and obviously they were no help."

When I questioned the need to induce labor she brushed off my concerns and told me ""I didn't know enough to make that decision."" During the induction process-which spanned two full days-she wanted to give me morphine to sleep at night. I refused and just took one Ambien. I was really appalled she would suggest giving a pregnant woman morphine when clearly it was not warranted. During the induction process whenever my husband or myslef would question aomething-such as why I had to stay on my back at all times or why she wanted to give me morphine-she would become very defensive and refuse to answer the question."

I was given an extremely rare, in this country, injury at her hands. She closed me up bleeding profusely. Literally, bleeding to the point that the blood bank was called. It was a gross action from a doctor. Even nurses commented about how horrible she was. I was transferred out of that hospital after 12 days and into the hands of a miracle doctor who put me back together. She was unkind and uncaring.

She didn't listen to my wishes, broke my water, sped my labor, and ended in emergency c-section. I felt she looked down on me as a single, pregnant woman and treated me with less respect than sure would someone she perceived to be more responsible.

Then made me go for a chest X-ray when I was pregnant. All this was unnecessary. Then made me visit a infectious disease specialist due to TB skin test being positive and he was unimpressed by her knowledge of TB and BCG vaccine. Then she broke my water prematurely during checkup. I came to know later that she was actually ""sweeping my membranes"". I was forced to go the the hospital and put on Pitocin to start my labor when I was not at all ready. Overall, I had bad experiences with her and do not consider her a good doctor."

Shortly after they broke up another women named Ilene became friends with Ulbrich. A patient. But just a friend. When she realized she wasn't going to get to be the next doctors wife she got together with Tina and they turned him into the board for dating patients. He is at fault for dating patients but more then that he's at fault for dating ****es. Shame on you two women for your vindictive, hateful actions. Do not think that you can do these vengeful actions and think that you will suffer no consequence. I know that there are two sides of the story but you both have kids and should worry about the consequence of your bad seeds. He DID NOT deserve this.

I got pregnant again almost a year after my son was born, and the very first thing she said to me, when she saw me in the ultrasound room was, ""what happened to the birth control I gave you?"" So rude, and even more so hurtful because we found out during the visit the baby didn't survive. She immediately pushed for me to have surgery to remove the baby. The only contact I ever received from her office after that were one phone call to see when I wanted to schedule surgery. She wanted to put me on birth control after my miscarriage for at least 3 months. I later realized that was because women are the most fertile for the first 3 months after a miscarriage.

Great person, great doctor, and very straightforward. She will tell you what is going on making it easy for you to feel comfortable every step of the way. She was our OBGYN through the birth of our first daughter. All I can say is I wish she had delivered our baby because she put both me and my wife at complete easy. It is a shame it depends on the day the doctor is on call. We know it would have been an excellent experience to have her have delivered our first baby. She came by after to see how we were doing and gave us a nice warm hug. Can't say enough about Dr. Fisch, she is great!"

I came from a horrible experience at another Atlanta office and she eased my fears immediately. I had fertility issues and some family history concerns and she made sure to cover all bases to make sure my concerns were addressed during my two pregnancies. She has a great bedside manner without being overbearing or ""mushy"". Her nurse Ebony is always polite, helpful and caring. I recommend Dr. Fisch to anyone who is searching for an OB/Gyn in Atlanta."

She is thorough, friendly, knowledgeable and answers all questions very clearly. However, I was not happy about the way she treated me after the hysterectomy she performed on me. It created sexual issues (pain and lack of libido) and, through the next visits, she kept saying it was psychological. I know my body, and I know for a fact that the surgery created these issues that I did not have before the hysterectomy. So I never went back."

Also, on principle I'm upset that I had to pay for parking because I'd been there for over two hours (for a simple, 5 minute annual visit). The pap smear was painful, and they ""recommended"" I get blood work which I did not want to do and didn't need. I did it anyway, and turns out, that blood work wasn't covered by insurance! I was billed for what I thought was the total amount, then realized via my insurance company that it wasn't the total amount.

But all of the other foolishness makes it hard for me to get there. I've had better service at Wendy's than I did at this supposed ""boutique"" practice. Dr. Hood is not punctual. Her staff is not helpful. I had a miscarriage four weeks ago. From the moment I found out I was pregnant up and through now when I'm still waiting on test results from a test I took last week, this has been horrible. Google has been a better doctor to me than this woman. Her nurse has an attitude problem. She's always too busy to actually talk to me. I am still having complications that I can't get seen because her staff doesn't think it's bad enough to schedule me an appointment. I really like Dr. Hood. I can look past her punctuality issue because she is a good doctor. Her staff however is the reason I'm seeking another doctor--with haste."

At 8:25, I told a staff member that I had to be out of the office by 8:45 to get to work on time. They called me in to take my vitals, but then sent me out to wait again. I decided at 8:40 that I would have to reschedule. The nurse called my name at 8:43, but I had to leave for work. It took ten more minutes on top of that for the receptionist to reschedule me before realizing I'd have to wait more than a week for another 8am appointment, so I just requested a refund. I basically woke up earlier to drive in from Kennesaw, wasted gas (I usually take the bus to work), sat in an office for an hour, paid a $5 parking fee, and was still late to work for nothing. Not a single apology from anyone in the office either. Being a great doctor does not excuse gross disrespect of a patient's time."

I liked her knowledge of all the questions I asked her during both my pregnancies. I do agree that she is in and out of the room after she sees about you but I do believe its because she has a high volume of patients and she needs to see of of them before closing, I would recommend her to anyone looking for a obygn.

This was our first baby together, but not separately so we have experience with going through a pregnancy before. First the doctor has no bedside manner, she seemed very offensive when we want to get a second opinion to the position of our baby. Not to mention the second opinion was correct and we didn't even get an apology. Secondly there is a long wait after you are waiting for the doctor in a seperate room and she does her check fast and is out of the room in about 10 mins even though you have waited 45 mins to 1 hour. Thirdly my baby was more than full term and the doctor started to talk about the baby might die causing a stressful situation more stressful than it should have been. Thank God our baby was born 100% healthy Thanks only to God and the patience he has given us. We, I mean my husband and I even felt at times that the doctor did not particularly like both parents in the room. However we always went together since that is how we make decisions based on our Faith. Even the doctor said she had never met clients like us before that did not instantly take her advice without question! I would not recommend Dr. Katia Castillo to my enemies let alone my friends."

When I went in for my first prenatal appointment I shared with her I was still in considerable pain. She dismissed this again. I was admitted to the hospital later that week only to find that I had a large cyst on my right ovary. I also asked the doctor about specific medications safe of not to take during pregnancy. she flat out told me they were fine. I later found out some of the medications I was taking were off limits while pregnant. The nurse staff is very nice with the exception of the front desk. She never smiles and is generally very rude.

They are in her office for her ability, knowledge and because they need special care for their ailments. Dr. Dawson's manner of working with his patients leaves much to be desired. She needs to approach them with their personal medical history and take the time necessary to inform the patient and allow them time for questions. She is dry, like many other reviews have mentioned. True, it is not a social meeting, but it needs to be more personable. Originally I had hopes that Dr. Dawson would be a ""holistic"" doctor, with a personable approach and without all the publicity. This has turned out to be false. Dr. Dawson is very interested in promoting her products, assuring that her patients buy her products and insisting upon many blood tests. These blood tests are usually not covered by most insurance companies. I do not recommend Dr. Dawson and because of all my comments, above, I am switching Gynecologists!"

As an African-American woman, I sought out a practitioner that I felt I could relate to. I spent 10 years being referred to this doctor and that specialist without Dr. Dawson taking the time to personalize my care and really focus. I switched my care to a caucasian doctor who diagnosed me the same day as my initial appointment, performed in-office diagnostics and scheduled surgery to correct it. I am one week post-up and never felt-better. I don't feel that Dr. Dawson took time to personalize my care and simple referred me to her colleagues to get me out of her hair. I don't appreciate that. Her office is old, creeky, and lacks up-to-date technology and her staff is a bit empathetic. The front office staff lack personality and are often curt, rude and abrasive over the phone.

Amongst other reasons, this one instance was the icing on the cake for me. I went in for an emergency appt. and the most she did was ask me if I was still taking a medicataion that she had prescribed a year earlier. She did not examine me and I'm wondering if it was because this was not a ""scheduled"" appt. I am back on the prescription as she suggested but unfortunately my condition has not changed. It seems as though Dr. Dawson is focusing more on her specialized weight loss program which is OK but please communicate that to your other patients so that they are given the option to stay or find another doctor.

I ended up getting a partial hysterectomy. SHE WAS GREAT. She provided the pictures I asked for and called me a couple of times post surgery to make sure I was okay. I recommend Dr. Dawson to anyone that ask me for a name of a good GYN. Her holistic approach is what we need more of. People fail to understand the impact drug can have on ones system even if taken for a short peroid of time. We need a network of holisitic doctors. Thanks Dr. Dawson.

He made a second incesion and they both have a lot of scar tissue. It's enough that 5 out of 6 doctors told me I needed surgery to fix it. The only doctor that said no wanted to give it a little more time to see if the problems would stop. The area around the scar still swells and still gets tender. I've had another doctor look at the scar a couple of years ago and she was shocked at how bad the scar is and how tender it still is. The only reason Dr Healey tied my tubes is because the other doctor left the practice. If we had met Dr Healey before the procedure I would have gone somewhere else. When we went to Dr Healey to tell him I was having problems and wanted to know what he recommended. Dr Healey couldn't bother to put his phone down long enough to talk to us until we said we wanted him to pay to fix it. He has no bedside manner. I tell my female friend to avoid this practice. I wouldn't trust Dr Healey to spay a dog

After finding out I was pregnant, exciting because I am a new mom carrying my first child, I scheduled my appt with Arista Obgyn. They were the only office that could see me next day (because clearly no one booked appts. after meeting his horrible staff.) the doctor was unhelpful and in knowledgeable about how far along I was. the office would not give me any paperwork confirming my pregnancy. And they billed me for tests I hadn't been administered. And when calling to see if my bill could be fixed, the rude woman told me that she had done the billing herself and it was right! They overcharged me almost $80. I might send her a calculator for simple math. I called back this morning to see if my records had been Reviewed. She told me Dr. Healey did it yesterday. After asking if they had been released she became hostil and yelled that she had already answered me. In my experience Reviewed and Released are different words with different meanings. I do not recommend them"

He said he could see it during the exam, and took a biopsy. He then explained the next steps,and gave me an information packet. After a week of worrying and crying, they called back with the biopsy results. NO, I did not have cervical cancer, and everything was fine. Later that day I called to express my feelings of how I felt and to ask why a doctor would say something like that without knowing for sure, and that I was upset. The receptionist was rude and said maybe three times and why are you upset. When I replied back, ""I was told I have cancer, when I do not!I've been worried for a week, along with my family. Do you not understand why I would be upset?"" I expected some sort of an apology, but instead I was told by her she had a college degree and then I was called a b**ch, and was hung up on. I have never experienced anything like this before. I wish I would have read the reviews before ever entering this office. They should be shut down!!!"

My wife had a complication in pregnancy, and getting any needed information is like pulling teeth. We decided to switch doctors, and they said they would not release records for 30 days. Now she is 7.5 months pregnant and can't get treatment for a month. Not fair that they try and play games when there are possible health issues at risk. I would not recommend anyone using this doctor for your own health and safety."

The staff is unfriendly and disorganized, Dr. Healey is unable to answer or satisfactorily explain the simplest of questions. I asked that my care be transferred to another practice (something that seems to be quite common for them judging by the manner in which they received this request) and have been told that my records will not be released for 30 days (which is law - common practice being 5 days or less). Would NOT recommend this practice to anyone."

I am grateful, although I don't think I was ready to come off of medications when I did I think he was great and took great care of me. I think that we should give him and his staff the credit they deserve instead of bad experiences. The team saved my life and create lives of many unborn cildren. The fact of the matter is the man is going to do what is best instead of what you want. He has been in practice enough to know the in and outs of gynocological conditions and treatments. Females tend to use these parts of their bodies to get pain meds and he is hip to that behavior. So if you have something wrong with you, truley I recommend this doctor for your female problems and child bearing experiences. This was a great experience for me and even with complications of the recovery the issues were handled properly. Thank You arista ObGyN.............Sincerly,CHASTITY STATON"

Dr. Healey and his staff have seen me through a miscarriage followed by a DNC and the healthy birth of my son. During my son's pregancy I was a nervous wreck and the nursing staff were always nice and helpful with any calls of concerns or questions I had. Dr. Healey was very aware of my fears of losing this pregancy and took great care to ease my fears, and was very nice when he would get a call at 2am when I went into early labor at 30wks. I ended up having to be induced when I began to bleed in my 36wk and Dr. Healey's knowledge and care allowed me to deliver a healthy baby boy. All the nurses have always been helpful and nice and I enjoy Dr. Healey's years of experience instead of a dr. who only goes by the book. I would recommend him to anyone."

There was an issue with my medical records that should have been cleared up during the two months prior that I made the appointment. I heard her yell at her staff for the lack of medical records. Then was totally rude to me. They left me in a room for an hour an half. When I complained and told them I wanted my money back. They said they just got my medical records. Which I know the hippa laws they needed my signature which they only asked for 15 min before. So they lied about trying to get them early in the morning. I arrived 45 min early they never asked for my signature. Then after all that she tells me she can't tell me anything because she doesn't have what she needed in my medical records. I was so pissed. If they had asked I could have brought them everything they needed. I will not recommend anyone going to her. I put in a complaint and working on getting my co pay back. It was such a waste of time!!!

Her attitude towards me was hostile for no reason at all, it just seems to be her way of dealing with patients.

She and her staff were courteous and professional. She has a good rapport with her patients! She even remembered me after I had not seen her for almost 2 years. The only thing I don't like is that she is in such demand that it is hard to get an appointment; she maybe booked for months sometimes.

The only drawback is that she is pretty popular and her office is pretty busy.. but that's the case with most OBGYN's these days. I feel very lucky to have found her.

In terms of timeliness, the office has consistently been on par with other offices that I have visited (wait time of about 10 - 15 min). However the doctor has been less than helpful or interested in my care. From her demeanor and eagerness to get me out of the office, I do not believe that Dr. Cyd Williams is very interested in the total care of her patients. Dr. Williams seems very knowledgeable but lacks tact and the office seems to have a lacks policy on patient privacy (this includes the nurses)."

I wasn't very pleased with her response during my first visit to confirm my pregnancy. My pregnancy was high risk and I left the appointment on the verge of tears - not about the pregnancy as much as how she imparted information. She was distant, cold and made me feel dumb for being a high risk pregnancy. I believe she is competent but after two more visits with her I decided to change to a doctor with a better attitude."

Dr. Williams was the one who I liked the least. She seemed rushed the whole appointment. She acted as though she couldn't wait to get out of the room, and she seemed annoyed that I asked her normal, routine questions. I saw her twice while I was pregnant and she was like this each time. On the last visit, her cell phone rang in the middle of my appointment. She unbelievable pulled out her phone, looked to see who was calling and went to answer it. She looked at me and saw the look on my face which must've been a mix between shock and disgust. Fortunately, she put her phone away."

I was left with internet research to explain what was going on, which was awful and completely unacceptable.

When I asked Dr. Fogle to repeat the 8 point BPP with me she very rude and curt told me that she can not because the ultrasound tech was in the room for more that 30 minutes. Unbelievable based on the fact that my baby was not cooperating or moving. Because of her falsifying my records I will be filing a complaint against her medical license. Stay away from this doctor!!!

She is very direct and doesn't sugar coat anything, and almost seems like she's using scare tactics. Especially when delivering bad news, I prefer a doctor who seems to have compassion and empathy.

I had to see Dr. Fogle because my main doctor was out of town. I felt that Dr. Fogle came across abrasive and not really warm. She left me on the table waiting for her (it happens I guess) so when she came in I was hoping for a more upbeat energy. The physician I usually see is very friendly, knowledgable and makes an effort to make me feel comfortable. The experience with her was you need to do this, this and that. Almost like you were being lectured and then asked me if somebody had given be different information by the look on my face. To be fair, Im not her patient. However, I wouldn't want to her again. "

I am very pregnant and lying flat on my back on a hard table for that long was excruciating. When she finally showed up, we were interrupted twice - she did say she covering other people's patients, so I tried to be patient. However, she wasn't even going to do her own ultrasound (standard procedure at this practice), which meant I was left on the waiting on the table unnecessarily. She rushed through the appointment and didn't give me any time up front to ask questions. Long story short, I felt judged over some inconsistent logging of my blood sugars, and when I tried to explain why and ask questions, I was cut off. No effort to listen, understand, empathize, or, most importantly, solve the problem. Just, ""You should be doing this,"" and threat of still birth wielded like a club to scare me straight. I would not recommend this doctor."

He was able to clearly show the baby's heat beat and the growth was 7 weeks 1 day. Dr.Fisher was really upset that I was late to the apointment and never thought I going to have that kind of stress after seeing her. I dont know why she said that I going to have misscarraige. If she couldnt see the baby properly she shouldnt have told me like that. And I was really worried and thought my life is going to go away.

I've never been sick before so I had a lot of questions and concerns,I felt uncomfortable about being nude and answering questions about my personal sex life,I wasn't fast at answering questions because I didn't expect them. I felt exposed. So,to have someone treat me like I was slow, or like I should feel better by now, or well since I've seen you today 1 week after surgery don't bother to come back for your follow up which should be 3 weeks later and ""oh you're still having symptons"" I'll call in a prescription and not tell you its there..is off putting to say the least. NO,it is rude and disrespectful.  I still have symptoms but I AM NOT GOING BACK. She is knowledgeable and if courtesy is not importatant this might be a match."

As a newly-pregnant woman, this was very disappointing, because I had wanted to see if she would be the best doctor for me. The woman that did inspect me did not ask me any questions about how I was feeling. She only asked if I had questions for her. I forgot to ask about swine flu vaccines, and she never brought it up. She then told be that at their practice, the doctors rotate out, and there was only a 1 in 4 chance that Dr. Lemon would deliver my baby. Not at all the personal relationship with an OBGYN that I was looking for. Again, I never actually met Dr. Lemon, but I was not at all impressed with her practice."

She was one of the best for pre-natal care; very good at helping us through our nervousness and patient about answering questions. She also was an *excellent* surgeon when it came time to do an emergency c-section. My scar is the least noticeable I've ever seen (or heard of.) Can't say enough good about her.

Just now getting to the point I can share because I was very angry. I had post-menopausal very heavy clotting and bleeding. She wanted me to come to the office for uterine biopsies, not once, but three times. Ridiculous. and painful. Also had several expensive ultrasounds over a year. The last time I saw her she talked fast, seemed rushed, yet I could hear here chatting away with a friend in the next room before she came to mine... had lots of time to talk with her. She tried to minimize my problem even though I was passing giant clots. Suggested that I might had a urinary tract problem, so urine was cultured unnecessarily, of course the office could profit from that, too. The next day I went to see my internist, who did an exam, was horrified with what she saw, and got me referred immediately to a different gynecologist. I was scheduled for a hysterectomy the next week. Fast forward a few months from that point and I had a neighbor telling me that Dr Cummings had scheduled her for another ultrasound and uterine biopsy in the office.... I was horrified to realize that we both were part of a plan to stall and not address real problems, all the while the dr's office was collecting large fees from insurance. My neighbor went to a different gynecologist and guess what she also needed a hysterectomy. I would say to any woman out there to stay away from that dr's office. I personally would not trust anything there after my experiences. There are much better options."

The woman that I spoke to had no solutions to get me in quickly based on another members mistake and I was told Dr. Laura Cummings is very busy. I am VERY busy too and had to get several hours out of my work schedule to make this appointment, drive to the office, pay $4 to park and was EXTREMLY disappointed in the outcome. I am NEW to Atlanta Dr. Laura Cummings was a referral and I am going to facebook and email my friends that it was a bad experience.

2292,Dr. Kimberly Carroll,Atlanta,Georgia, Gynecologists (OBGYN) , Female,2,3.5,2014-04-07T14:29:58Z,2,4,1,2,1,First Dr. Carroll didn't even introduce herself when she came in the room. This was my first visit. She was not very personal. I came to doctor Carroll because I was looking for a black doctor that I would be comfortable around. She did not make my doctors visit a great one. The office charged my visit as a specialty visit for asking a question and Dr. Carroll writing a prescription for something she found. Then I waited in the waiting room for two hours. This was a bad experience and I would not recommend anyone visit this office. I think I will return to my old doctor because she was not impressive at all.

Google her name to find a litany of complaints about her staff and first patient treatment. No matter how good a doctor might be, her front desk tells you a lot about how they really feel about you as a patient. You go to get well and receive proper care, not be berated and treated rudely by ignorant personnel."

She is the best doctor I have ever spoken to or been involved with. She delayed some plans she already had to make sure she could be there to deliver our son. If she is rated below 5 then I would say something is wrong with the patient before it would be the doctor. I wish I could give out my contact info to be a reference because you dont find doctors like her very often. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

I'm an RN, and she acted like my educated thoughts on different thoughts or diagnoses about my health were stupid/outrageous/unimportant. She brushed it off like it was not important and not even a feasible possibility for my health to be a certain way. THEN, she billed my insurance for the diagnosis she didn't even help me with! The blood work she so graciously offered to me after she discredited my thoughts about blood level imbalances they ""did not get enough blood work,"" when I gave plenty of tubes and have very easy veins to stick did not even provide any answers for the ""diagnosis"" she billed me for. Then to add insult to injury their office manager never called me back when I had complaints submitted through the business office about how/why I did not want to pay. I'm very frustrated with her and this entire practice. I've only been there once, but I'll definitely keep writing reviews and will never recommend anyone to go there!"

When visiting with Dr. Miller I did not have that personal experience. My first visit was done with a nurse in the room.

I am over 40 - with a history of family cancer. After my apt (where I did not have the pap smear based on her advice though it had been 1.5 years since my last) I checked online and with a colleague (who is a medical dr. though not gynecologist.) Online I found that the maximum length of time someone should go between pap smears was 3 years (not 5). Also, my colleague told me that her dr. recommended every year for women over 40."

Meanwhile, I could hear her in the room next to me while she ""worked in"" another patient before me. Next, she was in the hall dealing with the pharmaceutical sales rep. Excuse me, but I'm a patient. The sales rep wants to SELL YOU SOMETHING! She will wait! Trust me! I got up and left. I told the woman at checkout that I was leaving and as I turned toward the exit, the doctor chased me down and asked if I had 5 minutes. Yeah - I had an hour but you just blew it! She didn't have my chart of my study that she was supposed to be consulting me on. She didn't even know which doctor had referred me. She called later and recommended a procedure for me that has alarming side effects and a low rate of rehabilitation. Stay away. Oh, on top of it, I got a bill today for her ""consultation""!!!!"

I was referred to her for a second opinion because I was told that I needed a hysterectomy. She confirmed that surgery was indeed needed and based on the level of discomfort and the length of time that I had suffered she scheduled as soon as I was mentally ready to move forward. I had several appointments with her before the actual surgery. The office staff was very professional and friendly. Dr. Howard made sure that I had a clear understanding concerning the procedure as well as what to expect afterwards. Her bedside manner was great. After I woke up from surgery and the room visits that followed I couldn’t have asked for better treatment. She didn’t treat me as just another patient there was a genuine care. One of the reasons it took me so long to agree to having surgery was because I was afraid Dr. Howard I would recommend her anyone in need of a good Ob/Gyn or facing surgery.

My partner recovered from Hep C and I was trying to understand if I may be at risk. His response was ""It's probably fine so long as your partner is telling the truth."" This did not answer any of my questions or allow me to understand if I am at risk. This is the type of doctoring that leads people to not come back.

Perry,Atlanta,Georgia, Gynecologists (OBGYN) , Male,1,2,2008-02-21T09:15:36Z,2,1,4,2,1,"This young and obviously inexperienced doctor noticed a subchorionic bleed on an ultrasound of mine at 7 weeks. Baby looked fine and he said not to worry, the bleed would go away and all was well. He told me to come back for my regular 12 week check up and no follow up would be necessary. Well, two days before that 12 week check up, I started bleeding more heavily than before and it turned out that little baby could no longer survive b/c my placenta was detaching from the bleed. There are options for trying to treat this diagnosis, although this doctor offered none of that. I am now pregnant again, have the same diagnosis with a different doc and baby is doing well with the help of weekly ultrasounds, blood work, and meds to monitor and control the bleed. I would not recommend this doctor to anyone. If you have a normal pregnancy, you might not notice his inexperience, but if you need help, he has no clue!"

Long wait only to be completely disregarded as she rushed through only a partial exam. My concerns were completely ignored, she wouldn't even listen to my issues nevermind address anything I had to say. Worst patient experience ever! I'll be looking elsewhere for a new doctor."

He delivered all 4 of my children and he is so caring. I lost a baby and he called the hospital constantly checking on me and told me if I just needed to talk, just to call him. I could have never made it through my pregnancies without him. Too bad he has retired."
2350,Dr. Joseph H. Barnes,Atlanta,Georgia, Gynecologists (OBGYN) , Male,2,4.83,2007-03-27T08:24:07Z,5,,5,5,5,"Dr. Barnes is very ""to the point"". I am in and out in minimal time and he doesn't drag out my pap or other exams. He has never kept me waiting, and I can tell that he gets annoyed with the nurses if they take too long bringing me back to the room. I had one occasion where I had an out of the ordinary situation and he saw me that same day."

Kassam,Atlanta,Georgia, Gynecologists (OBGYN) , Female,2,1,2012-02-04T14:44:29Z,1,1,1,1,1,"I never really understood why people took the time to rate doctors before my terrible experiences with Dr. Kassam and her office staff. I am new to Atlanta and needed a doctor covered by my insurance. I waited over an hour to see Dr. Kassam and when I asked her staff whether I should just try to make another appointment because of the long wait I was told that most patients have to wait 2 hours and I shouldn't complain. When I finally got to see her, Dr. Kassam told me that the best way to address my heavy periods was to have a hysterectomy right away. When I asked about other options - for example, shouldn't I have an ultrasound first - she told me that American women whine all the time and have no tolerance for pain. Whoa. I had to convince her that I should an ultrasound first. I did that and the office LOST my lab work and told me I needed to go ahead and schedule surgery. When I saw Dr. Kassam again, she was so rude to me that I just left before the exam was over."
2353,Dr. Carla E. Crawford,Atlanta,Georgia, Gynecologists (OBGYN) , Female,1,1,2013-06-20T13:56:53Z,1,1,1,1,1,"The experience I've had with Dr. Crawford's office was awful. The billing department billed me incorrectly for a significant sum that I had paid in office and got nasty with me when I tried to help resolve the situation with my insurance company. Before I even went to see her I confirmed several times with her and my insurance company that everything would indeed be covered 100%. After receiving incorrect bills I tried multiple times to straighten the amount out with her office, but to no avail. Finally, I told her office that I would go in in-person and we could adjust the discrepancies with my insurance company together so we'd all be on the same page. Her scheduler told me that I would be billed for an office visit if I were to COME IN, and not even to see the doctor! Dishonest and incompetent office staff who would not own up to having made mistakes."
