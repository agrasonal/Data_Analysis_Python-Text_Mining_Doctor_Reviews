It was a terrible cancer to have because most patients had no symptoms until it is too late. We search high and low for a surgeon who would take my dad's case. After much effort, no one thought that was a possible surgery except Dr. Biehl. I still remember the surgery day. It was intense and emotional. But my dad made it! It has been four years now and my dad is doing well. I always want to thank him. Thank you Dr. Biehl for doing what you do. May God bless you!"

Dr. Precht's claims about her credentials are misleading -- she is board certified as a general surgeon, not a cosmetic or plastic surgeon. The American Academy of Cosmetic Surgery is only a membership group open to all physicians, not a certification board. Nor does it offer surgical fellowships, like Dr. Precht claims. "
5,Dr. Lisa M. Precht,Seattle,Washington, General Surgeons , Female,5,4.7,2014-08-30T05:06:37.043Z,5,5,5,5,5,"I had liposuction done on my abdomen & hips 5 weeks ago. I did A LOT of research before I chose Dr. Precht. I am so incredibly happy I chose her! The day of the procedure went very smoothly, and that afternoon I just went home and slept. The next day, I was back to my usual self, although I was a little sore. But already my results are beyond my expectations!! I am finally comfortable with my body, and I recently put on a bikini and felt great, something I hadn't done in YEARS!!! Her staff is super nice and professional, and made me feel so welcome every time I had an appointment. I am so happy with my results and highly recommend her!"

Precht,Seattle,Washington, General Surgeons , Female,5,4.7,2013-07-23T08:22:46Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr Precht and her staff have been over the top helpful and friendly through out the entire process of my Tummy Tuck. Even to the point of having Dr Precht's cel phone # after surgery to call anytime day or night 24-7 with any questions or concerns I might have. I have never heard of a doctor doing that before! Also the costs were exactly what were estimated. After researching, Dr Precht was far above the rest on the list for me and I am exceedingly happy I chose her. She is very easy to talk to. Also, her staff is super friendly. The whole experience was a happy one."

The customer service is top notch, professional and friendly. I would like to call out Dr. Lohse for his extra care. I came in with Mallet's finger, which is relatively common for somebody in his field, but he really took the time to explain it to me and what my options were, including the pros and cons. Highly recommended from expertise to bedside manner, thank you!"

He is so knowledgeable,calm, cool and collected with wonderful bedside manner. I would highly recommend him!"
19,Dr. Michael J. Hart,Seattle,Washington, General Surgeons , Male,3,5,2008-09-11T14:05:24Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Hart is helpful, knowlegable, and VERY nice! He was comforting and informative. He knew what was wrong and how to fix it. He reassured me and my family on the day of surgery. He actually went out to talk to my family after the surgery (instead of calling or sending a nurse down to talk to them). I was in the hospital for 7 days and he came in EVERY DAY (and sometimes twice a day) to check up on me and see how I was doing. His office staff are helpful and didn't make you feel like just a number. I feel like I am important when I walk in the office and that my concerns and needs are important. In addition, he was able to fit me in for surgery right away. I didn't want to wait weeks or months for a surgeon to decide they can finally do my surgery. Dr. Hart is a wonderful, skilled, and compassionate surgeon. I feel so lucky to have had him as part of my team."
20,Dr. Michael J. Hart,Seattle,Washington, General Surgeons , Male,3,5,2008-06-09T01:27:57Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr Hart was awesome. I would definitely have him as my surgeon again. He came to see me before the surgery and reassure me that everything would be okay. My problem was worse than originally thought so what was supposed to be a day surgery and ended up with me having to stay in the hospital over the weekend. While all the residents took good care of me, he came in over the weekend to see how I was doing. Great guy, I would love to have him as my dr again (although that would mean I need surgery and that's bad!) :)"

25,Dr. Jens R. Chapman,Seattle,Washington, General Surgeons , Male,13,3.37,2017-05-22T17:40:51.022Z,5,5,5,5,5,"He heals worst cases others avoid.
Frankly, most surgeons can't do the complicated surgeries so they don't take the patient.
If you take highly impaired people the risk factors are high.
The worst cases come through the door 'a mess'.
Thank god he did my surgery because an 'average' ortho would have butchered me.
I know this because I've worked inside healthcare (Northwestern, Chicago, Mass General, Boston) all of my adult life, and therefore, I know how to pick a ""winner"" vs. ""average"" surgeon.
Most people pick a surgeon because they 'like' them or 'their friends' told them or looking at sites like this. Go Deeper. Study Up.
Training + Experience + level of disability addressed successfully with ALL the facts on board will lead you to Dr. Chapman.
I spent a year researching before I approached him. I am qualified to offer this advice.

He is being sued for using non FDA products in surgeries where people died. He knew about it & he did it any way. He should be in jail. Find another doctor!

He is an expert in orthopedic and neurology surgery including laminoplasty of the cervical spine; an operation our local orthopedic surgeon would not attempt. He is an outstanding surgeon, was very polite and professional. He took the time to explain in detail the pros and cons of the surgery answering all our questions including several options. He performed the laminoplasty at HMC in early May of 2014 with no complications."

She always is on time and once when she wasn't, her nurse came in and said that she was running about 10 minutes behind. She comes highly recommended by other staff and has excellent bedside manner. Dr. Calhoun as well as her nurse were extremely attentive and took me seriously when I thought I had symptoms of something serious. Her nurse called me right back, paged the Dr. and got me scheduled immediately to see the Dr. Dr. Calhoun also said to never feel embarrassed of any symptoms and to always check them out as it could be something - it was great to hear that from an extremely busy surgeon."

I walked out of the office stunned that a doctor would spend that much time trying to get to know me, as a person. Even though I have moved out of state, I will still use Dr. White as my doctor. He even ansears his e-mails about any concerns I might have. Finally, I raved so much about Dr. White that now my wife is seeing him and has had the same experiance. Great guy!!!!!"

50,Dr. Eric M. Heinberg,Seattle,Washington, General Surgeons , Male,5,3.75,2018-05-08T23:03:15.886Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr Heinberg performed hernia surgery on me. Aside from a successful outcome, what I liked was
1. Dr Heinberg has a meaningful amount of experience performing hernia surgery (> 200 surgeries). That's one of the most important criteria to think about in choosing a surgeon.
2. He made a good effort to be responsive and answer my questions. In person and over email.
3. His attitude. I've spoken to at least 8 surgeons about surgery - both for me and as a caretaker for someone else. He's one of the good ones. He cares and has empathy for his patients. And I saw this more than once during the process of my surgery. After researching what could go wrong, I was deeply scared of surgery and he helped me get confident about my decision to have the surgery. And unlike with some other surgeons, I always felt respected - even if my questions were ""silly"".
Experienced. Responsive. Great attitude. "

Heinberg,Seattle,Washington, General Surgeons , Male,5,3.75,2015-10-08T16:10:54.241Z,1.5,3,1,1,1,"Dr. Heinberg's office rescheduled my appointment to a different day and then, on the day of, called to see if I could come early, essentially right away. Otherwise, my appointment was going to be bumped to yet another day, so I left work right then and went straight to his office. I then waited in the lobby for 45 minutes; in the exam room, it was 30 minutes before I saw him, and at one point he left the room for a full 15 minutes. He'd come to this appointment straight from surgery and was clearly on an adrenaline high and completely unable to focus. He didn't know why I was there, had consulted the wrong records and didn't know how to bring up the right ones, and he repeatedly cut me off/talked over me as I tried to fill him in on a pretty simple to understand situation. We settled on a particular imaging test, but then when I went to that appointment, they had different instructions from him than what we'd discussed — so that was wasted time all around and, as far as I'm concerned, extra radiation I did not need. Afterward, there was zero follow-up to discuss the results. Would I ever take this doctor's advice or let someone who performed this way during a simple consultation operate on me? Not on my life."

He couldn't be bothered to return two phone calls which I left asking two questions: was my tumor
operable and if so, when could he do it. Didn't receive any return call in reply to the questions.
He had sent me to a plastic surgeon regarding a wound left by another tumor and that doctor said
he could do nothing until the new tumor was dealt with. My niece with 30 years nursing experience
was with me at that appointment and heard the plastic surgeon discussing things with Dr. Heinberg
on the phone - she also wondered why the waste of time for an appointment when Dr. Heinberg
should have known there was nothing the plastic surgeon could do until the 2nd tumor was removed.
Bottom-line - the actions of Dr. Heinberg were NOT professional!"

When complaining to the er room about an infusion reation (symptoms that always generaly occur shortly after my remicade treatment). I was misdiagnosed with a perferated bowel which required immediated attention. The medical staff failed to contact my G.I. Dr. and proceeded to remove all but 8"" of my colon. My case file and records were sent to S.California for further review. With a cast of many top notch individuals in their field, (Colo-rectal surgions, Professors of Gastointestinal Medicine, as well as others in the field), out-come was NEGLIGENCE!

I also played loud music with my roommates one night and had my right ear pointed directly at the speaker. I decided to see James Rockwell to make sure everything was cool. I found him to be extremely professional, but also personable, sensitive, understanding and caring. What really impressed me about him is that even though in retrospect it was pretty obvious that I was overreacting to my ear problems (turns out I have very good hearing and no other problems), he was extremely gentle about pointing out that he expects me to explore all possible avenues of reassurance before using a doctor for that purpose. Which I agree with completely. Definitely one of the better doctors I've ever gotten help from."

61,Dr. James C. Rockwell,Seattle,Washington, General Surgeons , Male,7,3.44,2009-05-20T18:31:49Z,4.8,4,5,5,5,"I had a deviated septum. Dr Rockwell performed surgery on me, and I was very impressed. He knew exactly what was wrong with me, and knew how to fix it. He took time to explain everything to me in a satisfactory way. He answered all my questions very knowledgeably. It was nice to finally have a doctor listen to me and not act like I didn't know what was going on with my own body."
62,Dr. James C. Rockwell,Seattle,Washington, General Surgeons , Male,7,3.44,2008-04-14T18:44:01Z,5,5,5,5,5,I've been seeing Dr Rockwell for 10 years and his father before that since the fifties and I'm still kickin.

64,Dr. James C. Rockwell,Seattle,Washington, General Surgeons , Male,7,3.44,2006-11-16T16:03:53Z,1.3,,2,1,1,"I had a ""UPPP"" (soft palate resection, tonsil removal, nose job) surgical procedure performed on me by Dr. Rockwell. He promised me that it would be 80% or better chance of complete success. I was to find out later from support staff, (those that treated the fallout from his practice) that he had about one out of eight success rate. That sounds more credible every time over the years since having professionals look at my throat & nose. I was surgery #3 of 5 surgeries he performed that morning. I wonder what happened to patients #4 and #5. I hope they are still alive. Sterile surgical procedures were breached while under Rockwell's care and I lost a month's income, time with my family--recovering in the hospital and elsewhere. More sorrowful was the follow-up sleep study done a year later. Dr. Rockwell's procedure was determined to be not only a failure, but since the surgery, it was concluded that I would spend the rest of my life dependent upon a machine to make me breathe."

66,Dr. Felix W. Chu,Seattle,Washington, General Surgeons , Male,9,3.6,2015-07-01T09:23:42.377Z,1.5,1,3,1,1,"I was refereed to Dr Felix Chu by my primary care physician in 2012. The care I received from Dr. Chu was very disappointing. I was experiencing swallowing difficulties, and particles of food were getting stuck in the back of my throat when I ate. This problem frequently developed into ear infections. Dr. Chu ordered a swallow study and an MRI . The swallow study was to study what happens when I eat different types of food. Well after waiting for the proper authorizations the staff insisted that Dr. Chu specifically ordered a liquid only swallow study. Apparently the swallow study that involves consuming small portions of food involved the speech department. I tried to explain to the staff ( actually pleaded). that Dr. Chu wanted for me to have the swallow study that involved food, howeever the doctor's orders were written only for liquids. I unnecessarily paid for two very expensive tests, not to mention subjecting my body to chemicals that were needed to perform those tests. At the follow up appointment Dr. Chu shared that there were no signs of problems. I left extremely frustrated with Dr. Chu and his staff. Exactly two years later I made another appointment to discuss that my swallow problems still existed and was becoming increasingly more painful. Dr. Chu asked about the different type of foods that get lodged in the back of my throat once again.. He also was surprised that I did not have the proper swallow study. He recommended that we start all over again since it had been two years since the other MRI and swallow study. Dr. Chu's office staff told me to expect a call shortly from the department that would perform the tests. I waited a few weeks, and called his office again about my long over due swallow study. I have a fairly complicated medical history and try to stay within the network. today I am looking for a new doctor who will hopefully order the correct tests, amd actually listen to their patients concerns. I have seen a few doctors in my life, and Dr. Chu made me feel that he just did not truly listen. His office staff however deserves the award for most incompetent staff ."
67,Dr. Felix W. Chu,Seattle,Washington, General Surgeons , Male,9,3.6,2012-06-21T20:25:44Z,1.3,1,2,1,1,"Did not coordinate care with my other attending physicians. Ignored I was on Warfarin but he did not moderate or suspend usage before operation that resulted in higher level of blood and slower healing. Seemed disinterested. Went out of country following surgery and had to deal with office staff when complications resulted from medication allergy. Rather than work harder to satisfy my displeasure with his service, he seemed to prefer me to just walk away from his practice in need of another follow-up surgery for the same condition that he failed to resolve."

Chu,Seattle,Washington, General Surgeons , Male,9,3.6,2010-04-27T15:29:41Z,5,5,5,5,5,Dr. Chu's immediate diagnosis and rapid response to my dad’s stage IIII throat & neck cancer along with his excellent team of colleagues saved my dads life 10 years ago this June.

80,Dr. Sara Javid,Seattle,Washington, General Surgeons , Female,2,4,2017-02-17T21:14:23.933Z,5,5,5,5,5,"I was dx'd with invasive breast cancer in Nov. 2016 after a tumor was seen in a routine mammogram. At first I was stunned & overwhelmed. After I met Dr Javid & the staff at Seattle Cancer Care Alliance (SCCA), I knew I was in good hands. I knew I wanted a surgeon who specializes in breast surgery, which Dr Javis does (along with endocrine cancers). She has an impressive resume. She has a pleasant manner, explained my medical situation well & my treatment options. As a surgeon, she has a delicate, but decisive touch. I chose to have breast conserving lumpectomy with sentinel node biopsy. I had my surgery in December 2016. I had a 1.7 cm tumor removed. There was no cancer in the nodes. I met the criteria to not require radiation follow-up, but am starting estrogen inhibiting medication (Arimidex). I believe Dr Javid probably saved my life. Not that cosmetics were my main concern, I have just the smallest half-moon scar on my breast....even a movies star would be pleased with this outcome. I have had an easy & rapid recovery. I only needed pain medication for one day post surgery (The incision on the breast never hurt really, but the incisions in the armpit were painful). I am now back doing Pilates three times per week. I would recommend Dr Javid & SCCA to any patient needing care for breast cancer."

He consulted with another physician before meeting with me, reviewed my test results with me, spent extra time explaining and reviewing my options, answered all my questions and responded to my comments, and then let me make my own decision comfortably. Never at any time did I feel pressured to do one procedure over another for the sake of his pocketbook. I feel the good outcome of the surgery was a result of his knowledge of and experience with the subject, sensitivity to my desires to avoid poisonous chemicals, and upbeat, caring treatment of me personally. He had been recommended by a nurse in another department, and I concur in her recommendation of Dr. McCourtie for anyone needing major surgery in the Wenatchee WA area."

In his dealings with me he was consistently arrogant, dismissive and unknowledgeable. He ABSOLUTELY could NOT hear any of my own questions or concerns. Was basically deaf, blind and dumb to me as a sensitive patient interested in the quality of my personal care. Later, upon my discharge, he actually wrote up a report in which he created a completely fictitious scenario -- a TOTAL FABRICATION -- wherein he was some sort of ""Master Problem Solver"" and I was a problem! A CLEAR attempt to make himself out to be some sort of hero. In all of my years of dealing with medical professionals I have never seen anything like it. This poor fellow is, again, absolutely UNABLE to register patient concerns. I believe that he should NOT be practicing medicine without some sort of major psychotherapeutic intervention.

He didn't tell me about any possible complications beforehand (and Swedish Hospital had me sign something saying I had been so informed), but afterwards my whole groin turned purple and one of my testicles swelled to the size of my fist. Moreover, I was abused by the administrator, the nurse, and the anesthesiologist. But what really bothers me is that after six years of numbness at the site of the operation, it suddenly stopped being numb and started hurting, especially every time I have an orgasm. I notified Dr. Ting immediately by fax, and got no reply. Then I called his office several months later and was told that he wouldn't see me unless I pay cash up front because I no longer have insurance. I complained, and his business manager said she would have him take care of me and she would call me back. She didn't. It is amazing to me that Dr. Ting doesn't even want to learn about problems with his procedure."

Dr. Chung failed to achieve good margins, and a second surgery further mutilated my breast. Dr. Chung had examined me yet failed to notice obvious signs of previous weight loss, and she blamed her surgical failure on my body. As a result of her arrogance and dismissiveness, Dr. Chung was unprepared for my surgery. "

120,Dr. Juan Delaossa,Seattle,Washington, General Surgeons , Male,2,2.38,2010-03-18T21:52:04Z,2.8,4,4,2,1,"I truly believe he botched my surgery, but I don't have any definitive proof as he can just say I didn't follow his recovery directions, which is true because every time I talked to him, he told me something different. He started my surgery late, he left before I woke up, and nobody even told me what they had done. I had to call and ask the next day. Then in my follow up appointments he changed his story every time about my recovery. He comes off as a nice guy, but the more I dealt with him the less I thought of him. I plan on having his ""routine surgery"" botch fixed this fall by someone else at a different clinic. I hurt just as much today as I did right after surgery a year ago and he told me you should have no pain after a month. From now on I will insist on more upfront info and get 2nd and 3rd opinions."

It's now 7 months later, I've seen 6 other doctors and am having surgery from someone else this Friday. I would definitely not recommend him."

He was rude, condescending, and a rare example of pure chauvenism. I had a serious medical problem that needed prompt attention, but I started over with another doctor as I did not trust my life in this man's hands. BEWARE."

Never told me the Mesh was plastic in the consultation. Dr Taagen and Brakstad failed to properly diagnose the necessity of surgery. I had Mesh removal from the toxic plastic and pain a year later which ruined my life. All this for a lipoma and greedy bad guidance. 
125,Dr. James M. Hotaling,Seattle,Washington, General Surgeons , Male,2,1.13,2017-05-24T20:39:34.307Z,1,1,1,1,1,"Dr. Hotaling and his always unpleasant PA Kelley Taylor have wasted two years of my life with constant tests and ill-advised procedures that have cost me hundreds of dollars and my insurance provider thousands of dollars. He and Kelley care little for patient care, do not listen or accurately document feedback and are only looking for patients that they can grossly overcharge continually. During our first meeting he flat out admitted this while explaining how nice the new Day Break Clinic is but that it had to be paid for with increased billable hours. How’s that for quality of care!? I first visited Dr. Hotaling for ED treatment. Wisely, he wanted to rule out any underlying or obvious health conditions that might be the main cause of my issue. Since that meeting I have followed EVERY piece of advice they have recommended. I met with a general practitioner and nothing found during physical. I met with a cardiologist who discovered I had high cholesterol. So far he is the only one who has made an accurate diagnosis and prescribed medications to deal with it. The last 18 months have been a series of countless tests or procedures ordered by Dr. Hotaling and Kelley. I made eleven visits to get over 30 different blood tests done. I have visited their offices six times. I even underwent a horrifically unpleasant experience where he took 12 small samples directly from my Prostate. The results of all of that….nothing…completely cleared. All of these costly tests revealed nothing but elevated testosterone, estrogen and red blood cells. He refused to treat the estrogen problem because I wouldn’t turn all my hormone care over to him so I had to find drugs and treat it myself. He agreed to keep monitoring my blood levels but that was over-ruled by Kelley who said they treated the initial symptoms and they were free from a liability standpoint and wouldn’t be treating me in that area. Just tremendous care for the patient there, done as soon as they aren’t liable. Clearly they are both in medicine for the right reason. During my first visit I was honest with Dr. Hotaling and informed him I self-administered testosterone. I thought honesty was the right course but it was continually used against me from that point on and Kelley was particularly judgmental about it and focused more on that than the patient care I was seeking. He continually threatened severe life consequences as a result of my testosterone use. But, when pressed, he could provide ZERO clinical studies to prove his point. He said it has been “possibly” linked to liver disease and kidney function and possibly to some forms of cancer, but would not provide any data to back this up. I did my own research, he was referencing a different steroid designed for animals that I never used. I went forward with their care for ED which got me unpleasant results. They prescribed close to $800 dollars in oral medications initially which my insurance does not cover and I refused as an option. Clearly he has a great relationship with the drug companies….wonder how many Utah basketball and football and NBA games he was treated to over the last couple years as a result? They also prescribed me Timix which is a straight injection into the area. During the first in-office test I informed Kelley that there was no difference in blood volume to the area. She disagreed and said there was. She ordered a prescription that was vastly under-dosed. I informed her two visits later that I had to greatly exceed the prescribed volume. She ignored the feedback and told me “if it worked once it will work every time.” The prescribed amount was 10 to 15 iu. I was using 90 iu I remember telling Kelley that specifically but she still documented it in the system as me using only 60 iu! Over the last year I’ve suffered through multiple injections each time at the under-dosed amount. Today when I walked in for my one year follow up, Dr. Hotaling and Kelley had a clear agenda they followed. She wasn’t scheduled to be there but showed up. He was unpleasant from the get go. He made a couple rude remarks about my testosterone that was still not backed by any facts. When I told him the amount of Timix I was using he looked shocked as it was up to 170 iu’s in order to work and he accused me of misuse?! I told him I’d documented this many months prior with Kelley but she just stared at her computer screen. He suddenly looked relived as he had his out and he said he was uncomfortable treating me because I had misused the prescription. After the countless misguided tests that produced nothing of value, after close to twenty total visits to his office and the office of his colleagues, eleven visits to the blood clinic, two visits to the hospital….somehow I had not held up my end of the bargain!??? That in a nutshell is the care provided by Dr. Hotaling. I’d avoid them both at all costs. Mr. Jon Huntsman sure nailed it on the head when he said the University Healthcare system in in complete disarray. "

I would never go to this doctor, nor recommend anyone else should. He suggested I would need surgery in two areas and told me that I should take CoQ10. He said surgery might help, but it wasn't 100%, and even gave me paperwork saying they don't know why the surgery would help. He and his partner in crime, Dr Dorais, pushed us to the most expensive option first and foremost, instead of trying to figure out what is really wrong. I lost a lot of respect for doctors after seeing him, and realize he was looking out for quick money from his patients. Since then, we have found another doctor who said he saw NO need for surgery or even a hint for it. He did a more thorough examination than Dr Hotaling did. I asked him if I should keep taking CoQ10, and he said they're just vitamins and likely wouldn't help our health problem at all. In summary, Hotaling suggested a totally unnecessary surgery for the sake of skimming more money off of us. Do not go to this doctor!"

I am not sure how he passed medical school, he probably had someone else take the exams for him. He lacks complete subject knowledge. INCOMPETENT, UNSKILLED, RUDE. This guy is crazy! READ THIS: http://www.kirotv.com/news/16186188/deta... what kind of person gets into a fight with street hoodlums? And he is a doctor?? STAY AWAY FROM THIS GUY IF YOU VALUE YOUR LIFE AT ALL!!!

128,Dr. Paul E. Gott,Seattle,Washington, General Surgeons , Male,1,1,2017-11-27T23:14:59.931Z,1,1,1,1,1,"This doctor is more interested in himself than his patients. Let me make it clear, we do not blame him for the cancer, but his narcissism may have cost my partner his life but his unwillingness to do a simple test to rule out any spreading. It may not have shown anything, but you took that away...read on and you will see.
My partner had a missed diagnosis due to lack of attention from Dr. Paul E. Gott. When it was discovered it had moved to a Stage III-IV and had potentially made it into his blood stream. Immediate surgery was performed. After the whole experience, I have a background at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research and I asked whether he would perform another set of standard scans which he replied ""I got it all and there is no need"".
Well Dr. Gott, there was a need to rule it out, because now he has metastatic cancer and maybe looking at 3-6 month span. His current dr asked us if the physician performed the very test I asked you about!!!!
If you are assigned Dr. Gott to try and save your life...then just know you are welcome to reach out to me personally and I will share as much detail as legal. Do NOT be fooled by his confidence, I wasn't but had already been through so much I didn't force it. It took another qualified doctor to make me know I knew what I was doing.
You are a horrible doctor, Paul E. Gott!"
129,Dr. Thomas R. Biehl,Seattle,Washington, General Surgeons , Male,4,5,2014-10-21T03:04:45.159Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Biehl saved my dad's life! Four years ago my dad was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. It was a terrible cancer to have because most patients had no symptoms until it is too late. We search high and low for a surgeon who would take my dad's case. After much effort, no one thought that was a possible surgery except Dr. Biehl. I still remember the surgery day. It was intense and emotional. But my dad made it! It has been four years now and my dad is doing well. I always want to thank him. Thank you Dr. Biehl for doing what you do. May God bless you!"
