0	Apr 20, 2018	5	Cosmetic, Plastic & Reconstructive Surgery	Dr. Rafi Bidros	Houston,	5	5	Dr. Bidros is an exceptional physician and surgeon. My wife had a mastectomy on one breast that was reconstructed by another plastic surgeon. The results were not to her liking and the surgeon felt that no more could be done. Another surgeon was consulted but he offered no remedies. Today, my wife is thrilled with the outcome. Dr. Bidros is quite gifted and knowledgeable. He provided surgical solutions that the other surgeons could not provide. He and his staff are an incredible group of people.	5	Under 10 minutes	TX	5	5.0	5

The office messed up with the insurance, sent wrong/unnecessary information resulting in denial of coverage. Talked to the insurance. They understood and recommended an appeal with a call from the doctor. Office was not supportive. The doctor called me to let me have it. Never stopped to ask my side.

His manners at that time were bad; he yelled at me and was very rude in talking with me and treated me as if I was ignorant and did not want to listen to what medication my surgeon had started me on.

164	Aug 28, 2016	4	Cardiovascular & Pulmonary Diseases	Dr. Alfred Maksoud	Webster,	28	4	I have never had doctor and his nurse treat me with disrepect as much as they did.  The way he talked down to me, he was very condescending and he made me feel like I was wasting his time while he was telling me the results of the tests he wanted me to have done, I never felt so down on myself as I did when I left his office that day. They need to work on their manners when someone goes to their office seeking help and relief for their symptoms. Have some professional courtesy please.	3	16 – 30 minutes	TX	1	3.4	3
