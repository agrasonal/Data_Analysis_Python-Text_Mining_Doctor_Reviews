I had high hopes for this doctor and was disappointed that all of his recommendations for me were based on anecdotal evidence and experience with past clients, not lab work. Additionally, his main recommendation included an extreme diet that would have no way been healthy for me and to lose as much weight as possible although I am already at a very healthy weight. Following his guidance would have been dangerous to my health."

She doesn't make me feel like a just another patient. I feel like she actually listens to my concerns and I love that she takes into consideration that I know my body and regular health best. I have seen 2 other doctors at NWPC and I don't feel like they really considered me as a person but more as just another patient. The rest of the staff is also amazing! When my son was 2 years old he had a fever of 103 appear out of nowhere on a Friday at 2:00 p.m. His regular pediatrician wouldn't even consider taking him that late on a Friday. They told me ""Just take him to the ER if it's still that high tomorrow."" I called NWPC, originally they said they don't take patients that young, but as soon as I explained the situation and what the pediatric office said they asked me ""How soon can you get him here?"" Dr. Bullard, both of her RNs, and the desk staff of NWPC are held in high regards in my book."

The only reason she didn't receive a 5 for punctuality is because she takes however much time you need to talk to her. When I started taking my Mother to her, she was starting to have dementia problems. I was rushing my Mother one day to let Dr. Bullard go and she stopped me and said, ""Let her talk, I have time to listen"". She is the only Doctor that I have known since I was a kid who takes time for her patient. One other thing. She gave my Mother some free (sample) medication and we forgot it. As we were about to get into the car, Dr. Bullard came running down 5 floors & out to the car to give my Mother her trial medication. HOW many Doctors do you know that would do that for their patient. She is now my Doctor. If 5 is the best, Dr. Michelle Bullard is a 10. Signed: Tommy Pittard"

Having a PhD myself, and two brothers who are surgeons themselves, I expect a certain level of professionalism from care givers. He has exceeded every time. I agree with the previous poster questioning the negative reviews - I understand that not all experiences can be positive, but the level of negativity with which a couple of previous posts have achieved makes me believe that they are from someone who wishes him to fail in his new practice. I'd gone to various physicians for 25 years, and I wouldn't trade Dr. Maidenberg for any of them. That he was voted one of the best in Houston by his peers should say more than any negative posters here. He now practices on Dairy Ashford near Briar Forest if anyone is looking."

I'm sure he couldn't tell his patients that he moved due to contractual issues with selling his practice. I just wish I would have found him a month ago when I was looking for a new doc to replace him. I am having some iron level issues and he would have explained everything to me I'm sure. Now I'm stressed and am going to see a hematologist. He may have recommended this anyway.

The office is dingy, with pervasively blaring CNN-TV commercials (on a loupe) that bludgeon the air and preclude any solace for their captive patients. The experience left me upset from the free clinic style atmosphere to which I am not accustomed, as with the noise, long wait, the poor caliber of attention, and the clientele. The exam room (smallest I have ever experienced) was cramped, and cluttered with numerous photocopied ""DO NOT's"" shouting from the walls. They are a condescending distraction to anyone with a shred of courtesy, or, common sense and typify the office's slap-dash, artless approach. One inference seemed to avert prescription drug abuse among patients. The back hall was blocked with unplugged equipment, and the entire back office, was choked with stacks of clutter. I found the used, dirty, steel utensils left in the sink from a previous patient very off-putting. Creepy experience."

A man who works as hard as he has caring for his patients for 45 yrs plus, must be doing something right. I too agree, his 30 yr reputation is of outstanding stature.

It’s a shame that an excellent Doctor like Dr Bortolotti is overshadowed by the poor and incompetent front desk staff, unfortunately Raquel is the the only name i could get, but the front desk is the first and last impression a patient has....too bad it couldn’t have been a more positive one.

She is very caring and knowledgeable. I started seeing an endocrinologist and did not see her for a few years. Now she is at her new UT Bayshore clinic and I have seen her twice recently. She is a wonderful doctor and I plan on seeing her now, rather than driving to the medical center."

Followed Dr. Bortolotti to UT Bayshore when she transferred, Love her, love this facility. Everyone is friendly and helpful. My first appointment was Dr. B's first at this new location. I did wait nearly 30 minutes in the exam room because they were giving her the rundown of their procedures. Grrr. However, I have been back 4-5 more times, usually wait 5-10 minutes after appointment time to exam room. Nurse does her things and within 5 minutes of nurse leaving room Dr. B comes in, smiling, hand extended, making me feel like she knows me and cares. She even remembers past conservations we've had! Appointments are readily available but am sure once word gets out how good she is, it will get harder! Highly recommend Dr. Bortolotti. I Finally found my Doctor! Took 20 years!!!!"

Being in overall good health, she takes every single of my ""over 30"" concerns to heart, and does what it takes to make me feel at ease.

I am disappointed that her staff has changed though. Her nurse is rude and unkempt. At my last visit she had her sick child at the nurse desk with her who was rude also. I may be switching to Dr. Hartig who I saw once for emergeny visit and was great. Would probably still see Dr. Julie if not for her staff. She is a great doctor.

I went to him at another office and later found out he had left. I recently located him again and look foward to having him as my doctor again.

I was also told that it is unrealistic for me to expect to be seen within an hour of my appointment time. She confused me with another patient and told me I needed my thyroid checked. She glared at me on the way back to the room because I asked 1 time if she was going to see me soon. She told me that I could leave and made a snarky comment to me. Her office is pretty disgusting. Dirt on the floor, peeling paint, and a layer of dust on everything. It was a terrible experience and complete waste of time."

She doesn't treat my presenting symptoms alone, but seeks to ensure I remain healthy or overcome contributing factors. She is not quick with a prescription pad when an exercise will resolve. She personally calls to follow up with every test or to confirm progress."

Not only does she care about my current conditions, but she works with me for better healthly life choices. She also is the first doctor that has ever called me after an appointment with her to follow up. The only negative that I have is with her staff knowledge of insurance coding. I had to pay for an annual check up which is supposed to be covered by my insurance without a copay, but I had to pay $200 for the office visit. The insurance did eventually pay for the whole thing, and I was never offered a reimbursment. I still have not gotten that resolved, but I am not going to let that stop me from seeing a great doctor."

She is at once professional, personal, knowledgeable, thorough, open-minded, caring, friendly, a good listener and its just a pleasure to visit her AND her entire staff who are like one big happy family and treat each patient with genuine friendliness. They are an amazing team and I've referred several people to Dr Goff because I knew she could (and did) help them. Most amazing of all is her wonderful bedside manner and the fact that she personally calls you to follow up!!! I can't speak highly enough about her. As a massage therapist, I can attest to her superior hands-on palpation skills. I found this out when I thought I might have a hernia. She expertly probed my lower abdomen and concluded I did not. A doctor who is uncomfortable touching his/her patient when the situation warrants it, is simply not worth having as a physician.(in my opinion)"

He was new and they asked him to do this because I had not selected a doctor for my child yet. He came into my room, and explained everything re my baby, and gave me an outline of what follow-ups and shots were needed for my child's well baby care, and stated that I did not need to use him, but to be sure I followed through with a doctor. That was 29 years ago. He is courteous, kind and very knowledgeable. He treats everyone equally and genuinely cares about you. He keeps up with current medical journals, advances and medications. He always runs behind on appointments, but that's because he takes the time to answer ALL of your questions, no matter how long it takes. My (now grown) children, husband and I will continue to use him until he is no longer in practice. Thanks Doc Hanser for many years of service!"

I enjoyed his personality and his interest. It is seldom to find a doctor that will take the time to listen rather then rush you out the door.

She has already spent 30 minutes with me, which is highly unusual. Yes, she runs late for her appointments. But I attribute that to the fact that she has many loyal patients and she takes as much time with them as she does with me. She listens to what I have to say and doesn't TELL me what I should do; she lets me participate in the decisions. She has treated every one of my many medical problems successfully."

She listens and cares. She has helped me turn my life around and has gotten me through tough times medically. I've seen other doctors in the practice for sinus infections etc for my chronic things I go back to Dr D. I recommend her to all my friends and they all love her and have been recommend to her by others."

She is a kind, caring, smart doctor and I wouldn't trade her another! I've referred many friends and family members to her and they have all been just as happy as I am. Before I found her I thought it was the norm for a doctor to stand with a hand on the doorknob ready to take off as soon as they got a chance, that is not the case with Dr. Domask. She sits and listens, REALLY listens, until you are done."

My only slightly negative mark is on punctuality...I have sometimes had to wait a few minutes for appointments but he is worth the wait. I have found him to be extremely knowledgeable, able to answer any questions I may have had. When one of my sisters contracted a fairly rare disease, I asked him about it and he gave all the right answers (I had previously researched the disease on my own). That was comforting. His bedside manner is always great and conscientious about prescribing generic when possible."

Sometimes the wait is a bit more than at other times, but I cant count the number of times I have been the one with the difficult condition that has thrown his schedule off. Dr. Bond is the most knowledgeable, consistent, caring physician I have ever known. He takes his time with his patients and is simply the most thorough doctor I have ever run across. Many times over the years I have had to see other doctors, OB-GYN, surgeons, among other specialists and have always walked away wishing it had been someone more like Dr. Bond. I know he is rare, but one can always hope. If your always in a super rush, he may not be for you, but if you want the best care you have ever received from a doctor that honestly listens, cares, and knows his stuff?? Look no farther."

But everyone who commented on Dr. Bond's soothing care, carefulness in diagnosis and treatment and overall excellence is also right. I have gone to Dr. Bond for 12 years and been astounded each time by how thorough he is from having me stick out my tongue to dealing with difficult problems I've brought to him to solve! I've sent many friends to Dr. Bond and they love him as well. I feel sorry for his staff because they have to deal with such a wide variety of patients and such an enormous caseload because so many people want Dr. Bond to be their doctor. I agree with the client who mentioned the fact that Dr. Bond calls the patient, rather than calling the patient in, is an outstanding and financially sound characteristic. He has even called to just see how I am! I once jokingly told Dr. Bond that I was afraid he would some day retire. He said he wouldn't until I was 65! He even shook on it!"

My husband and our five daughters are patients of his. This is very beneficial because he knows our family history. He does run late but who cares. Every doctor runs late but most of them suck when you finally see them. Dr. Bond returns ALL phone calls. He even PERSONALLY calls you back with test results and explains everything to you. Life is scary when you have a health issue - even if its just the flu- but Dr. Bond comforts you and cares for you and makes you well again. I love him and wish I would have found him sooner. We now live nearly 20 miles from him but I wouldn't see another physican if someone paid me. We have been with him for 8 years. And his staff is okay once you get to know them. they're just really ""comfortable"". once we went there late and the staff was complaining because he said ""she didn't drive here to say hello...pull the chart"" the entire staff went home and he took his time to see all 4 of us for the flu."

My son was 7 yrs old and suffering from asthma. His previous doctor had him taking 9 pills a day. Dr. Bond reduce his meds and advised to let him swim as often as possible and he eventually out grew his asthma. Yes, he runs behind on his appts. but it is worth the wait.

His primary concern is on the BEST method for treatment.

Each visit I have sat in the waiting room for at least (yes, at least) an hour after my scheduled appointment time. If I wanted an appointment at 11am I would've made an appointment for that time.

I can not say enough good things about Dr. Winstrom. From the waiting room which is calming and relaxing, to the staff that treats you like family everything is exceptional. Dr. Winstrom does not rush to a quick diagnosis and prescribe a pill. Dr. Winstrom searches by every means to find the CAUSE of your illness and treats the cause not just the symptoms. If every Dr. was as great as Dr. Winstrom the world would be a whole lot healthier. Wonderful, caring, knowledgable, TRULY interested in the whole patient - I could go on and on .

She was very attentive and knowlegable in alternative methods to treat the problems plus she also used the typical medicine that we have come to expect from modern doctors. Also, I found her to be pleasant and so the visits to her were not stressful to me. I really like her ""bedside manner."" And I did not have to wait long for my visit. To me, that is a great doctor."

She took the time to ask me all the questions needed to treat the underlying problem and not just fix the evident symptoms. Despite fitting me (a new patient) in the same day, my wait was no longer than typical, and most patients in the waiting room went in within 5 minutes of arrival. One would think a ""family"" doctor would have a breadth of knowledge without much depth, but Dr. Winstrom had a surprising depth of knowledge in at least two unrelated areas. I wouldn't hesitate to pay double or triple the cost, which is entirely out-of-pocket as she does not accept insurance. Finally, the atmosphere was great. Patients sitting in the waiting room actually spoke with one another (and me), causing the short wait to be pleasant."

I had a situation where I went to the hospital Emergency Room in a panic, and the next day went to her for followup care. She was thorough and took time to listen to all of my thoughts, and agreed with the ER doctor's prescription and course of care. We discussed alternative medicine in general and she was appreciative of my knowledge and overall good health. She calls herself the ""Good Old Fashioned Family Doc"" and has been around for quite a while. She does not let insurance companies tell her what to do, she does not get paid by them. I would not hesitate to return to her."

Their staff(Ashley) is great at taking care of referral's quickly! My husband goes to Dr. Spafford(in the same Practice), and they are both great at getting you in at the last minute quickly! They were recommended by 2 friends and I would recommend them as well!"
223,Dr. Tina Corkran,Houston,Texas,Family Doctor / G.P., Female,5,4.7,2008-08-19T15:38:32Z,4.5,5,3,5,5,"Dr. Corkran is in a practice with Dr. Spafford and they are both terrific. I've been seeing Dr. Corkran for over 2 years now and she's always helpful, patient, and knowledgeable. They are a Christian practice and will pray with you if you like. They also accept prayer requested. They are very compassionate and I would recommend either doctor to anyone."

When the lady on the other end of the phone picked up and i told her i wanted to make an appointment,she asked if it was my first time visiting and when i told her it was, she asked for my phone number to call me back. I still have not received a call back. I guess they only cater/care for current patients and do not wish to take on new patients. Very Disappointing."

Years of sun damage, stress and general aging had taken a toll on my face. I no longer looked as youthful as I felt! I did not recognize the old, tired looking lady that stared back at me in the mirror. Dr. Alavi suggested minimal procedures that made a huge difference. A little botox erased the frown lines on my forehead and the lines at the corners of my eyes. Juvederm gave me cheeks and lips again and filled in the lines around my nose and mouth. The whole experience was not painful,and Dr. Alavi is extremely skilled in achieving a completely natural look. I am now mistaken for my 30 year old daughter's ""friend"" at the mall instead of her mother! I reitred 6 months ago and recently had lunch with a group of women I worked with. There were several comments about how much younger I looked since I had retired! Thanks to Dr. Alavi I now again recognize the lady in the mirror! Debbie B."

I have been seeing her for several years and I absolutely love the care that I recieve from her and the staff.

I was very impressed with Dr. Alavi, I have never been to a doctor that actually sits down with you to talk with you about the reason for your visit and how we can resolve the problem. I am used to visiting doctors that spend five minutes with you and then stick you on medication, Dr. Alavi was the opposite. She not only wanted to talk about my current symptoms I was having but she also wanted to go back and figure out what may have caused them. I have seen Dr. Alavi for medical, laser treatments, facials and massages. I keep coming back because I am amazed to have found a doctor that truly cares about you and your wellbeing. I also love that her staff is as passionate as she is. I have always been greeted with a smile, they always make me feel welcomed and very comfortable. I will definitely continue to see Dr. Alavi for any situation that I maybe have or just any time I want to pamper myself."

The staff was so caring, this is what I needed at the time. I was so used to doctors not really listening and then when I went to Dr. Alavi, I found something so different. I had so many issues when I first went to Dr. Alavi and now many of them are gone. When I took her advice and followed her program, I lost weight, I felt better physically, I stopped having anxiety attacks daily, and she and her staff are helping me make it through menopause along with other issues. I feel that Dr. Alavi's staff is exceptional. They are all very friendly and caring. I have recommended Dr. Alavi and her staff to many of my friends. The only thing that holds them back is that she doesn't take their insurance. But, the time she gives to her patients is priceless. I have never had a doctor spend that kind of time with me and offer so much information."

Even though I no longer live in Texas, she is still my primary care physician. It's worth the trip back to get her excellent and very thorough care. I can honestly say she has improved my quality of life over the years."

There is sometimes a wait but the face to face time you get with the doctor makes up for that. Dr Alavi is very knowelgable, takes time to connect with you and to discover what life issues may be impacting your health and offers lifestyle change suggestions that are backed up with coaching support staff. She does not take insurance, but I beleive that is why you get the quality and quantity of time with her that you need."

She has been helpful on some medical issues but some still remain. She also will do phone consults at $250. hr. (which are not usually reimbursed by insurance). She is a real M.D. but does not do insurance billing and is not in-network for most people. But, if you have complicated health issues and are willing to reevaluate your diet, medicines and/or life style she is a valuable asset in the medical arsenal."

Dr. Popek is very attentive and knowledgeable. He takes the time to discuss the issues and makes his patients feel comfortable. He also has a good sense of humor and is very down to earth. One holiday weekend, we needed an emergency refill of medicine and after calling his office, he answered the call and had his computer open to discuss which prescription would be best. It was remarkable service and truly appreciated. As we all know, men avoid going to the doctor but Dr. Popek has made the yearly visit to the doctor pleasant for my hubby."

Tired charging me $50 for 11 pages of paper records ($25 for 4 pages of paper records and $25 for 7 pages of printed paper records from their EMR system). Told her that they are being printed and not burnt onto a cd so they cant charge me for electronic plus paper records. Complete idiots. Be prepared to pay a ton of money for exams that are covered by your insurance because she codes it wrong. Be prepared to wait over 2 hours for your appointment (notice how I didn't say walk in- a schedule appointment- this has happened every single time I have gone). She and her staff ignore in person messages, phone messages, and faxes. She will only respond when sent certified mail. Her staff is just atrocious... there are plenty of other places in NW Houston that will not be negligent in their billing/coding, who will acknowledge your communications, and will not overcharge you for your records.

I agree Dr. Ayoola has great bedside manners, however, she is too cheap and her staff is really unprofessional. They charge you $0.50 per paper if you request medical records or even labs to be printed. They NEVER pick up your calls and getting them to do anything for you is like pulling teeth that was glued into your mouth with the hardiest glue. I changed providers because of these reasons. A pt should never have to go through the stress of getting by the doctor's office lazy process just to get their medical concerns addressed. I would not recommend this practice because of the staff and inconvenience. "

She was very attentive to my problems and did everything she could to try to diagnose my condition. She was nothing but nice and caring. I have recommended her to all of my family and friends in the area because it's hard to find a good doctor. The staff is okay too. I find her personality a little more upbeat than the rest, but I they're still good at what they do. The only thing is that the seem to be lacking personality, which I like to help uplift me when I'm in a medical type setting. It helps me ease my stress. Overall, I would give her Dr. Ayoola a 5 on a 1 to 5 scale!"

If she doesn't know she will refer you to someone. I did once get referred to a doctor who I had a horrible experience. Oddly enough my sister went to the same doctor and loved her.

Ease of scheduling.
Clean facility with calming nature music.
Cons:
As a whole I felt that she did not focus on the initial reason for the visit, but took things in the direction that she wanted to. I would have liked to be tested for the issue that I reported first and then if needed other avenues could have been ventured."

Kovacs,Houston,Texas,Family Doctor / G.P., Female,17,3.81,2013-09-10T14:01:38Z,5,5,5,5,5,"To those who complain about Dr. Kovacs staff, I want to say that although in the past it has been lacking, and I have been upset at times, things have vastly improved and her assistant has always been extremely competent and on the ball. But let's look at what is really important here. Dr. Kovacs is totally on top of her game. She is highly trained and experienced and has near perfect bedside manner with compassion. She is very approachable and down to earth and humble and level headed and calm and respectful and kind. But most of all she is a greatly skilled physician with a dedicated passion for her work. As far as I know, and I have been a patient of hers long before she left Greenbriar, she has unique qualities that we all need in our doctor. She has it all. Anyone who thinks they can find a better physician out there will be hard pressed in the long haul. These breeds of doctors are few and far between. Sp please ignore the small stuff and go for what counts. She is gold."

Her staff now is better than it was, but we'll see. I am concerned about the commenter who said Dr. Kovacs is hard to reach in an emergency."

Her staff is incompetent or lazy, and, as the years went on, it became harder and harder to talk to Dr. Kovacs directly. So I couldn't get around the horrible staff. Dr. Kovacs had told a friend of mine one time that if it ever came to the point where she could not talk to her patients on the phone, she would want to quit being a doctor. Obviously, she made her peace with it, even quit even calling about test results. It's a shame. That is not how it was when I first started seeing her when she was at the clinic on Greenbriar."

Her nurse is pretty cool and most of the office staff is okay. So why did I quit seeing her? It is (literally) impossible to make an appointment over the phone. I have had to go in person to make them (which requires me to pay parking). There is an automated phone system but no one picks up and you cannot leave messages. I finally found a new doctor because it was too frustrating in the long run to keep her as my dr.

She is almost non-accessible even in emergency situations. Getting any response to calls or emails even for much needed prescriptions takes several calls and repeated messages. When I was a few minutes late to an appointment because of car trouble, I was told by her staff that I could not see her unless I paid a $35 missed appointment fee, which I did not have and could not afford. I begged them to let me talk to her, and they refused and showed absolutely no concern for me despite how sick I was. I ended up in the hospital the next day and nearly died."

Two years ago I had my first appoinment with Dr. ****. His receptionists were somewhat rude and hurried. I did not have a good feeling going in. After only a short wait, his nurse Lorene took me in and made me feel so comfortable. She listened to my history, was very knowledgeable and pleasant. It only got better from there. Dr. **** spent almost an hour with me and was very thorough. I even left with samples. Every visit since then has been the same quality care. I highly recommend this doctor."

He has a very good sense of humor and like they say, laughter is the best medicine. I had to stop seeing him when he changed to a premium plan but every doctor I have seen since makes me miss the times I was at his office. An expert at making you feel comfortable and extremely helpful with any ailness I had at the time, he knew I didn't have insurance on and would give free samples of medicine that would really help me out. Hope to see him again in the future and will make sure my next insurance has him listed as a provider."

I am now 20 and have been completely satisfied with his efforts as a Doctor. His new practice while pricey is amazing. I was sick during Christmas, and he got me a refill on my prescription and personally called me on Christmas day to check up on me. He has always been helpful, funny and caring and has always made going to the doctors relaxing and not stressful. I would highly recommend Dr Wolf to anybody as he is a great family doctor.

His staff is wonderful and very friendly as well. I just wish he would a lot more time between each patient so that he is able to address our concerns. I waited 1hr 30min in the waiting area and another 40 min in the room and I felt rushed with the exam and was not able to ask the questions and concerns I had. Although I know he cares deeply about all of his patients, there has to be a solution w/ the waiting."

He's a great doctor that will not turn you away or make you wait for days to see him. When I had a deep laceration and my old doctor's office offered to see me in a week, Dr. Wolf saw me THAT DAY as a new patient after hours and that is the very reason that I don't mind waiting when I go see him since I know he's doing the same for someone else. He's the best."
269,Dr. Cyril Wolf,Houston,Texas,Family Doctor / G.P., Male,7,4.53,2009-03-04T13:58:21Z,3.8,4,2,4,5,"Dr Wolf is a very nice and funny man, and I think he knows medicine very well, but he is EXTREMELY busy. You almost always wait at least 30-45min after your scheduled appt time to see him. It often seems like he's rushing through my appointment. His office also seems like a revolving door for reps from the drug companies. On the plus side, he frequently hooks you up with samples of any medicine you might need when he can."
270,Dr. Cyril Wolf,Houston,Texas,Family Doctor / G.P., Male,7,4.53,2007-03-17T00:00:00Z,5,,5,5,5,Dr. Wolf is a kind and caring doctor. He puts the patient first and has treated many of my family members and coworkers for years. I would refer him to anyone without hesitation.

He has 6 pa's and you will never see him! There are better docs in the area that will practice medicine ! Don't waste your time!

Basically he showed up, read the nurse's chart, asked a couple of questions and that was it. I prefer a doctor that spends more time with patients."
279,Dr. Edward Bruce McClendon,Houston,Texas,Family Doctor / G.P., Male,15,4.03,2009-05-17T19:09:15Z,4,4,5,4,3,"I have been going to Lakewood for years. In all those years I have only seen McClendon once. He was nice, but kind of rushed me. I prefer Johana, the PA. She is WONDERFUL!!! I give her 5 stars. In fact all his PA's are wonderful. I always ask for them. I would only see McClendon if no one else was available,"

She stays up to date with her medical training and knowledge. I bounced around from doctor to doctor looking for someone who could diagnose and treat me properly. I started going to her about 15 years ago and I can't imagine going to anyone else. She treats me like an individual - not a number. I whole-heartedly recommend Dr. Glenda Goodine. I don't know if I would be able to trust another physician as much as I trust her.

She reviews your labs thoroughly, calls you when needed to discuss serious results and referrals and is up to date on all the newest medical information. She may not always do what YOU want her to do...but YOU may not always know what is best for YOU! I would highly recommend Dr Goodine and her staff is helpful, polite, professional and knowledgable."

Dr. Goodine was not quick to treat the symdones but used her knowledge to sort through the signs. I was having gallbadder attacks, liver infection and kidney problems. I am a diabetic with asthma. She stepped through my illness to discover the root cause... thanks to her we discovered I was suffering from Hemochomis.... a genic defect that kills the carrier before they reach 60yo. Thanks to her she saved my life, my son's life and all my brothers and sisters. We are all in treatment and I'm feeling good about my future. She may act alittle cold, but I find that she is so intent on treating me (and making me treat myself also)that it so easy to think she is distanced. If you're looking for a doctor to cater to your whims, then Dr. Goodine is not for you. If you want good care, no-nonsense feedback, and a doctor willing to partner with you so you can take better care of yourself... then call her today."

She is very caring.Dr Goodine is an excellent physician.I too have had to see assc when she was booked-but I have found them to be very competent and I don't mind waiting as they will take time with me and my concerns.Dr Goodine has called me back at night to reply to my questions-when it was not urgent.She has a very busy practice but I don't feel I am herded around. Her nurses are good and attentive. Dr Goodine is an excellent physician.

Goodine,Houston,Texas,Family Doctor / G.P., Female,7,4.47,2005-12-27T13:59:52Z,2.7,,3,2,3,"Almost always have to see a PA rather than the doctor, esp if you're needing to see her in a reasonably short time. She (or PA) won't treat more than 2 conditions at a time, seemingly even if conditions are related. Will write prescriptions with few or no refills so you have to come back repeatedly just for regular meds. Cold bedside manner; lacks empathy; can make any relatively healthy patient feel like a hypochondriac. Money-hungry & detached...avoid this doctor & her staff! All the same notes go for her husband, Dr. Thomas Murphy, at the same group family practice in Pasadena."

He was very disrespectful, he will make an effort to listen to the patients complain. I could never get to him, I had to leave a message but never got a call back.

I had my regular yearly exam with him and he was very patient and listened to my concerns and didn't rush me out of the room. He took his time with me. His nurse (Alisha?) was great. She gave me her hand whenever she saw me in any discomfort (I'm sensitive) if I had any. She took my blood test and I never bruised and she was very patient and kind as well. My friend recommended him to me since she and her mother have been with him for several years.

We now live out of state, but miss her and her husband very much. They were both very caring, taking the time when necessary to listen well and to fully consider our needs. They would refer you to a specialist if that was called for. I never thought that was inappropriate. We have a large family, so we had a lot of opportunities for them to make mistakes, but I felt their professionalism was superb. I found out when I went to other doctors how good we really had it. I decided to write this when I was looking up their number on the internet to get a copy of my records, and discovered some who gave them bad ratings. I don't understand why anyone would rate them poorly. They were great for us."

In the beginning we didn't know each other and had to learn each others personalities. It like building a great marriage. You don't get to know the person until you live with them. Dr. Mandi and her staff are great!! Urgency on your part is not an emergency for everyone elses. You have to remember you only see one of her and her staff, but they see hundreds of you. With that being said you should be your best you at all times."

It seems as if she wants to send you to someone else to get you out of her hair. She has sent me to 4 other doctors. She doesn't want to refill my prescriptions and even though I brought all of my medical records from previous doctors she refused to look at them or even accept them. She was very rude and standoffish. I would not take my dog to this woman.

SHE AND HER STAFF ARE VERY ATTENTIVE, AND WE NEVER HAVE TO WAIT LONG AT ALL. THEY ARE VERY FLEXIBLE WITH APPOINTMENT TIMES, AND WORK WELL WITH YOUR SCHEDULE. MY HUSBAND WENT IN AND THERE WERE ABNORMALTIES IN HIS SCANS, AND DR. MANDY SENT HIM TO A HEART SPECIALIST WHO FOUND THAT HE HAD AN ANNURISM ON HIS AORTA WHICH SAVED MY HUSBANDS LIFT.

I went for blood work and a sonogram, after 2 weeks of not hearing from them I called and they claimed I had no thyroid condition and I had to come in for the results of the sonogram. So I make the appt and Dr Dhesi belittles my claim of a Thyroid condition, she acted like I lied to her. I left her office visibly upset, and I never got the info on my sonogram. Today I go to another Dr. He ran blood work, and asked my previous Dr before Dhesi got the info he needed and guess what? I have a Thyroid condition and I have no nodule in my throat or thyroid. If Dhesi would have asked me for my previous Dr's lab work I would have been happy to oblige her, but instead she treated me like a liar. I cancelled my daughters appt and I never returned. I would never go back!!"

She found a problem with my husbands heart and refered him the a cardiac doctor which saved his life. I have asthma and for the last 4 years it has been under control thanks to her. We live in the Woodlands and drive all the way to Willowbrook because we trust her to care for us. She always is friendly and very thorough.

While it can be a real hassle sometimes to make appoinments--they are not flexible when it comes to their 2 hour lunch break--and she requires that you come in for test results which is a pain, I can say I haven't found a good enough reason to find someone new. She has always been thorough in addressing all of my health concerns."

She took some getting used to but I wouldn't go to anyone else now. She did strike me as ""cold"" but she isn't at all -- far from it. She truly cares about our family. I agree that she schedules far too many appointments just to refill prescriptions. But that's not enough of a reason to switch to someone else. I trust her. My husband and now my elderly father go to her, also."

She has limited time and access. She seems very busy and does not spend much time with you when you are there. I think she is fairly new doctor and does not deal with patient problems. If you need a quick diagnosis - and don’t need follow up - she is the doctor for you. I also called and was told to go to ER which was rediculous and super expensive. ER found nothing wrong with me. Could have been handled with doctor visit.

I do not like to take medications and for simple things she wanted to prescribe me something for everthing. She is too busy and I called and was told to go to the ER for a possible allergies.

331,Dr. Hayley Nguyen,Houston,Texas,Family Doctor / G.P., Female,8,4.03,2014-02-14T14:11:54Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Very good physician she cares for my whole family, I have been seeing her since 2009 and feel lucky to have such a sweet competent physician.

With a smaller sized office, she is able to properly engage patients, diagnose and solve medical issues, and is generally available for appointments on short notice."
333,Dr. Hayley Nguyen,Houston,Texas,Family Doctor / G.P., Female,8,4.03,2011-01-04T13:25:30Z,3,4,4,2,2,"I have been disappointed with Dr. Nguyen since day one. She is always very ""busy"" and I often have to write down or rehearse what I want to tell her in order to get it all out in the short amount of time she spends with me. She has been treating the same condition for me for over a year now; however, she never treats it fully, just temporarily covers up the problem. When I called to have her call in a prescription b/c it was acting up again, I was told that I would have to come in b/c she doesn't call in prescriptions anymore. So basically, I have to come in to tell her about something she's seen over the past year and spend the 20 dollar copay, when I know she's not going to actually treat it anyway. Additionally, I am going out of town in 2 days and do not have time to make an appt with their limited office hours (closes at 3pm). There is a really awesome nurse that works there (Catherine), she's great and friendly and way more helpful than the actual Dr.! I will miss her."

I finally can say I have a good family care doctor, which can be challenging. Also, her staff is amazing and very easy to get an appt. I would highly recommend her to anyone needing a good primary care physician."

He failed to follow common protocols. Sent me home with antibiotics (not recommended) and said it would clear up on its own (not supported by research). He’s the “doctor” so I decided to trust him. It didn't clear up and it was an ugly mess when it quadrupled in size and burst on its own. I suffered excruciating pain and loss of mobility for 3 days after I visited him and then had to manage the result myself at midnight on a Sunday night. Bottom line, he followed none of the published protocols I found at any authoritative source and specifically at the National Institute of Health. He should NOT have taken a patient with a condition he was not qualified to deal with. In addition, his nurse has the personality of a Nazi SS Officer. Overall experience was BAD and I would NOT recommend him for anything but basic, non-critical medicine. When you need an antibiotic and don't really ""need"" a doctor."

HCT causes photosensitivity, so I asked if it would increase this effect. He said ""it doesn't cause that"" I said I was sure that it did, cited in everything I ever read. Still denied it caused photosensitivity. I let it go, maybe I was mistaken? Pick up the prescription and what does it say RIGHT ON THE LABEL? Avoid exposure to sunlight as this medication causes PHOTOSENSITIVITY! I could see if you said ""well, it isn't common"" or something, but he flat out denied this side-effect existed 3-4 times.

The doctor needs to be more respectful of the patient's time as well as that of their family members /friends who accompany them.

If you know that the doctor spends individualized time with his patients then stop overbooking him! I cannot understand why or how the office or the doctor can believe that their time and schedule is more important than their patients. I ended up walking out even before I was seen. It is an absurd wait time.

419,Dr. Victor C Knopp,Katy,Texas,Family Doctor / G.P., Male,14,3.54,2012-07-24T22:37:03Z,4,5,1,5,5,"I have been going to Dr. Knopp for over 10 years. You almost always have to wait--I count on spending 3 hours+. The reason is that he spends time with his patients. He is warm, concerned, listens and cares about & for you. Office staff is pleasant & knowledgeable. He has a tendency to treat everything himself but usually does a great job. Will always suggest a specialist if you ask him. If you come in informed & ask for certain tests, he's usually willing to do them. He's just a great doctor & wonderful Christian man."
420,Dr. Victor C Knopp,Katy,Texas,Family Doctor / G.P., Male,14,3.54,2011-04-15T10:38:46Z,5,5,5,5,5,"We found Dr. Knopp on uhc.com and chose him because he was very close to the house. My husband saw Dr. Knopp due to dizzyness and constant headaches. Dr. Knopp saw him in 20 minutes and spent a lot of time with him. He said he was very thorough, the most thorough any doctor has ever been. He asked all the right questions and actually listened. That is very rare to find a doctor who actually spends time with their patients and listens. He was very happy with his services and would definitely recommend him to others. His staff is also helpful and kind."

They can be short tempered and rude if you dare to question them on anything! I also know that appts. are double booked and even triple booked (I've seen the paperwork when the front office staff left a sign in sheet sitting out) Great Doctor, hate the wait time, I've often had to sit in a waiting room for 2 hours or more. My time happens to be important too."
422,Dr. Victor C Knopp,Katy,Texas,Family Doctor / G.P., Male,14,3.54,2010-09-23T14:39:13Z,4,4,2,5,5,"My family and I have seen Dr. Knopp many times. He is very good in all respects. Sometimes you have to wait a long time, but I think he does not rush a given patient just to stay on schedule."

He and Affinity Medical Associates are the worst. I've been with them for a period of 1 year and have constant problems. Staff at Affinity Medical Associates at Loeuta are very rude , specially Juanita and Teresa. If you want to void hassles and problems go somewhere else!"

You don't mind waiting while he's a long time with the patient before you because you know that he will be spending as long as it takes when he gets to you.

However, this office ended up being my son PCP and mine as well. The receptionist always sweet and punctual. The MD's especially Dr.Gonzalez speak and explain things to myself and my son. My 7 year old just laugh everytime we go. Plus, the office right down the freeway which is normally pretty busy do to the hours being from 7am to 9 pm. Longer way great service. When I lost insurance I only paid $20 for TB testing. Great practice."

He is prompt and you never wait long for appointments; they also leave open the exam room doors so you don't feel trapped inside wondering much longer you have to wait. He is one of those doctors that has a very calming, soothing, healing vibe. He is very kind and knowledgeable and genuinely cares about his patients. He always gets a visting doctor if he is out of the office and he even called to see if my fever broke when I had the flu last year. How many doctors do you know that follow up to see how their patients are feeling?! I highly recommend Dr. Shapiro to anyone looking or needing a new GP/Family Doctor."

His staff are top notch, but Oakman is a joke. He doesn't greet you when he comes in for an examination. The humorous (ie frightening) part of the interview for me was in going over my conditions and medications--most of which Oakman didn't have any knowledge of. I actually felt like I was being cross-examined by a hostile attorney when I explained my medicines. He seemed reluctant to actually examine me and prescribe any medication for me. He didn't seem interested in doing any testing or seeing me again for a follow-up. I really don't think he cares whether I live or die. His last words to me weren't ""nice to meet you"" or even ""goodbye"", but instead were ""you need to lose weight"". Wow. First and last visit for me. DON'T GO THERE!"
453,Dr. Jerry D. Oakman,Houston,Texas,Family Doctor / G.P., Male,6,3.96,2011-04-01T09:11:50Z,4.5,4,4,5,5,"I have been going to Dr. Oakman for years. Each time I visit him I leave feeling confident that I was diagonsed correctly. He spends a lot of time with each patient - so if I ever have to wait, I don't get upset because I know he will give me the same amount of time. Getting a doctor to spend more than 5 - 10 mins with you is almost unheard of.......so Kudos to Dr. Oakman!!"
454,Dr. Jerry D. Oakman,Houston,Texas,Family Doctor / G.P., Male,6,3.96,2010-12-16T13:36:28Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Family of 3 has used Dr. Oakman for 20 years. Extremely pleased; has always correctly diagnosed every problem--and we have had some doozies. Conservative in only requesting tests that are truly needed. Also, does NOT give antiobiotic prescriptions unless truly needed. Can not recommend high enough."
455,Dr. Jerry D. Oakman,Houston,Texas,Family Doctor / G.P., Male,6,3.96,2009-04-17T13:58:03Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Oakman is a wonderful MD. He has helped me deal with my anixety during the time my mother had cancer. He always remembers things about my life in general and always takes time to talk about how things are going in my life in general. I had lots of tonsil issues but he advised me I was too old to have removed. A friend my same age had hers removed and was not happy about doing it at all because the effect from the surgery were worse than the problmes leading up to it. Had I not moved to California, he would still be my primary care physician."

Dr. Oakman has very patiently listened to my multiple complaints and psychosocial problems. He has graciously advised me how to coordinate my care of other issues involving multiple specialists as well as treated the usual sniffles and UTI's.
457,Dr. Jerry D. Oakman,Houston,Texas,Family Doctor / G.P., Male,6,3.96,2008-11-19T05:53:46Z,2.3,3,1,2,3,"Every time any of us in the family see him, we have to wait a very long time past our appointment time to get in. Then, when you finally do see him, you feel as though he's not really listening to you. Very unsatisfying experience."

It's his staff that have moved me to consider another general practitioner for my needs. While I understand in this day and age that appointment times may not be met, I expect someone to advise me of this rather than making me wait without explanation. My time is as valuable to me as the doctor's is to him. His staff needs to bear that in mind."

Francis,Houston,Texas,Family Doctor / G.P., Male,12,3.46,2013-01-15T11:57:18Z,3,2,2,3,5,"I have been seeing Dr. Francis for at least 15 years and overall it has been a good experience. Unfortunately my last appointment did not occur because my appointment time of 9:30 was not met, and was still not met by 10:15. I do not appreciate doctor office who value the doctor's time but not mine. The staff didn't even offer an explanation; I was left in the waiting room with no indication of when I would actually be seen."

Francis,Houston,Texas,Family Doctor / G.P., Male,12,3.46,2011-10-03T10:50:53Z,5,5,5,5,5,"The last doctor I used for my hypothyroidism wanted to perform blood tests every 2 months at a price of $250. each, which was totally unnecessary. Dr. Francis performed one for less and prescribed the natural form of meds for me instead of what most doctors want to prescribe, Synthroid, which does not work for me. He gave me a 1 year prescription. I am VERY happy with him so far. He has saved me a lot of money and aggravation. I have no medical insurance."

They won't take care of the problem we have. Left me on hold for over 20 min. My husband needs a prescription that is a medical benefit and not a pharmacy benefit and the office will not order it in for us to pick up. They just said ""NO"". They do not work well with people that don't have a lot of money and actually need help. Not recommending."

He is a wonderful doctor who takes the time to listen to his patients and he honestly cares for them. He is great about sending you to a specialist when needed which I think some doctors want a quick fix and do not do this. He has been able to help me through serious medical issues and also those of my family.

Francis,Houston,Texas,Family Doctor / G.P., Male,12,3.46,2009-09-21T11:40:17Z,5,5,5,5,5,Dr. Francis was referred to me by my mother who has been seing him for most of the last 20 years. He is the best private general physician that I have been to and knows when to send you to a specialist. His staff is friendly and helpful and has even assisted my wife in disputing insurance claims with the emergency room. An overall friendly and helpful staff and excellent doctor.

We both thought he was great. He was quick to refer us if we needed to see a specialist, he managed our healthcare very well, and it was easy to get in if we were sick. We often remark that we wish we could have taken him with us when we moved."

Agreed. This happens way to often . We waited an hour to be seen, by wich time the Office was closing. He seemed rushed. Attentive. Polite in words and yet all answers to health. Issues end up with refering me to specialist with nothing to tide over the symptoms untill then. Asknowledgable as he maybe I didnt come For a social visit. I left with the same questions and knowledge i had going in. Feeling like an idiot for coming by. But what else is new. Most doctors are like this.
We could just blame the insyrance for not covering basic testing, diags, and limiting what docs can and cannot do."

He came to see him in hospital regularly and was not in a hurry to leave the room. He listened and explained and was very courteous and friendly. Just a very nice doctor.

Sutherland,Houston,Texas,Family Doctor / G.P., Female,4,4.19,2010-11-09T21:32:33Z,5,5,5,5,5,Dr. Sutherland is a physician who is both very knowledgeable and also an excellent listener. She tackeled my complex and multiple health issues with the goal of restoring as much of my health and function as is possible and also has tried to help me minimize my out of pocket costs as I am on a fixed income. She never minimizes a complaint but tries to find the cause and address it. She also never makes you feel like you are being rushed through an appointment and is very accessible in person or via e-mail. I feel blessed to have a PCP who seems to really care about her patients and who has the skills to care for them in the best possible way.

497,Dr. Vuong Mai,Houston,Texas,Family Doctor / G.P., Male,3,4.5,2014-07-21T23:07:42Z,4,4,4,4,4,Went for a yearly adult wellness checkup. Never been this doctor so I didn't know what to expect. Staff and doctor was friendly. They provided a thorough exam with a good bedside manner. The only minor complaint I have is that I had to call them after a week for my blood results instead of them calling me. As well as the office being further from me than I thought. All in all I will return and would recommend this doctors office.

He has always been caring and professional. When I have lab testing done, he always personally calls with the results, whether good or bad. When I needed emergency thoracic surgery, he recommended a wonderful surgeon. Now that I no longer have health insurance, he tries to prescribe medications that are less expensive, and often reduces his charges, since I pay on the spot. I have recommended him to a number of my friends, and they are all very pleased with him."
517,Dr. Roger W. Schultz,Houston,Texas,Family Doctor / G.P., Male,6,3.65,2006-12-22T19:30:04Z,2,,4,1,1,"I had been advised that Dr. Schultz only sent blood work results if the tests were not good. On June 27 I had work done. After 1 phone call and FOUR (4) LETTERS, I finally received the results - I'm at HIGH RISK for Cardio CRP according to the testing facility. Not only did Dr. Schultz NOT advise me of this, he didn't offer ANY consultation or advice on what could be done to improve my condition. I feel he's uncaring, unproffesional and I will not be going to him again. I'm also going to report him to the Texas Medical Board, which won't do any good since they're just a ""band of brothers"" when it comes to disciplibary action, but, it will be on record."

If we''re really sick, they are usually able to schedule an appointment the same day -- rather than requiring us to wait several days for an appointment. They know us as a family, and always ask how everyone is doing. When we needed to be referred to a specialist, Dr. Pham was able to refer us to someone he knew and trusted; and he took the extra step of following our case and making sure we understood our treatment options and knew that we could contact him if we had any concerns or needed questions answered. We''re very lucky to have Dr. Pham as our family doctor."

The staff I got to interact with were very professional. The waiting area is very clean and very roomy. I was in the waiting area for about 5 minutes. The nurse was very friendly and seemed concern for the reason of my visit. She took time to ask me many questions. Dr. Patterson was in the exam room as soon as the nurse was done which was no more than 5 minutes! I have never experienced such a punctual doctor. Once Dr. Patterson entered the exam room he introduced himself and asked me questions. He made observations and recommended what to do. I felt he was very confident and knowledgeable. He also made me feel like he really care about me and seem very concerned. He even took the time to give me a little advice on my toddler. Which I highly appreciate! He recommended what to do and I felt he was making the best decision. He assured me not to worry with a good reasonable reason. Dr. Patterson made me feel comfortable and important.

She doesn't hesitate to refer to a specialist if something is beyond her practice. For basic stuff, I simply love her. And I love that she is so willing to do all the background work needed to give to a specialist instead of just packing me off blindly. She goes above and beyond, and she has a wonderful bedside manner throughout."

Most of them did not listen, and hardly spent any time at all. Dr. Jafari was unbelievable. Dr. Jafari was very caring, listened to patiently and gave me the attention that I was not getting from any primary care Dr. in the last five years. Staff was courteous and nice, but they can use some training. Overall I am very pleased that I have found Dr. Jafari, and I thank my friend who recommended her.

She told me that she didn't have a lot of time so make it quick when I went in to get checked. If you are even 10 pounds overweight avoid her! She will make it a point to tell you ""you know you don't have to be overweight, this is your choice."" She also told me that she wouldn't put me on birth control--even though it's what I asked for. Isn't that my choice? Worst. Doctor. Ever."

I know I can walk in her office, list my symptoms, get a quick check and be out the door and on my way in 10 minutes flat. Beautiful. Yeah, she asked me after seeing her a second time for a sinus infection if ""(she) needs to take me out back with the horses and shoot me"" - it's a jooke, she's hardly gruff about it. She simply has a different way of interactign with people. The office had a cozy front room and none of the exam rooms looked dirty by any means... I will be(and have been) back when I am ill."

She's not a pleasant person, nor does she have much patience with questions. It was offputting that the paper on top of the exam table had someone's handwritten phone # on it, so thanks heavens she directed me to a chair. I did like the receptionist, and I thought the waiting room was cozy. I found it odd that the medicine was out in the open, with a sign warning prosecution if you stole any. Maybe she should just put it in a locked cabinet!!!!"

She is the Dr. Phil of doctors. She tells you the truth, not what you just want to hear. She is a no BS person.

She is absolutly no b@llsh!t which is why I think some folks call her mean. She gives it to you straight by which I mean tells you what you need to be doing and doesn't sugar coat it. I actually appreciate that more than someone who will just coddle you. I'm a man and recently brought my daughter there who likes her attitude as well. Her office is a little shabby but I think that's how she keeps rates low for those who don't have insurance. And I love that she's not in the Medical Center so parking is free.

You will be seen by students/residents but, in my opinion, this provides for a more thorough and educational experience for the patient as well. Dr. Farnie is considerate and very intellegent and made me feel more than comfortable that he would provide me with the best medical care. I got a same-day appointment and waited maybe 20 minutes in the waiting room! I highly recommend him. I am a professional in healthcare and would trust him with any of my friends or family."

Prescription refills take forever to be filled; even my pharmacist is disgusted. All I require is pain management for my disease & I've been on the same meds for 2 yrs. Yet he will take up to a week to respond; while I can only lay in bed racked with pain & withdrawals."

Normally when I am there I see 3-4 students, which is ok but I expect to spend time with my physician alone to discuss my case - not happening. The person who I though was a nurse is actually a unprofessional medical assistant with no knowledge of policy, procedures or handling workman compensation cases. All my paperwork was incomplete and I had to constantly call over and over for 5 weeks to get paperwork completed while I am off work and NOT recieving a check! Need forms completed to return to work - this process again is a simple, but the person whom I thought was a nurse dropped the ball again. Dr. Farnie never returns your calls, he do not take the time to communicate with the patients he talks to the students instead and he is the worst on federal workman compensation cases. I do not recommed him at all. It is like a 3 ring circus trying to get a straight answer, paperwork complete or any professional help. Find someone else!"

The use of a resident/medical student for the primary examination is because this is a medical school clinic. You basically get the knowledge of two doctors for the price of one. I have used Dr. Farnie for more than five years. I have found him responsive to my concerns. He takes the time to explain procedures and conditions. I would recommend him and University of Texas Physicians highly.
570,Dr. Mark A. Farnie,Houston,Texas,Family Doctor / G.P., Male,9,3.52,2008-01-10T10:46:13Z,2,3,3,1,1,"A resident did my exam. The resident did an excellent job, but unfortunately the problem I had (have) was still unresolved. I called back to find out what I should do next to get the problem solved. I was told by a nurse that Dr Farnie said that there was NO plan for me. I said well I need help for this problem. She said they already did a test and it was not what they thought so sometimes we have pains that just don't go away. I told her to tell Dr. Farnie I needed help and it wasn't just some silly pain. She grudgingly got him to agree to a referral but he had no interest in my problem whatsoever. He barely looked at me or listened to me for more than 2 minutes or so and completely left everything up to the resident. I changed insurances so I could get my sweet doctor back that I had before. I do NOT recommend this one."

You have to deal with a student and he just approves whatever the student says. He does not examine the patient neither explain anything. He does not return calls or follows up on treatment. The whole thing feels like a circus. Horrible experience. I won't recommend to my enemy.

You MUST call first thing in the morning to get through at a decent wait time, otherwise you will be waiting for a while. The wait time to actually see her is HORRIBLE. Even if you arrive early, you WILL be waiting. Once you meet her, she is very kind, gentle & informative. Although it may seem like she is focusing on her laptop, she does pay attention to what you are saying and will try to help you. The online messaging system is GREAT and she will get back to you within 48hrs I've noticed. Great doctor, but HORRIBLE wait time to actually see her. I don't think they understand what an appointment really is."

After receiving a call from her office about my ""sugar results"" I was DENIED my request for a doctor to call me back with the abnormal level. I am an RN, as they are aware, so of course I wanted to know my results. Instead,I received a call from the office manager who stated, ""I understand you have some issues"" !!! To which, I replied, ""No, I don't have issues! I have questions!"" My request for a callback from the doctor with my lab result was DENIED and I was told I would have to wait until my follow up appointment to discuss my labs - EVEN THOUGH I WAS MADE AWARE THAT MY ""SUGAR"" LEVEL WAS ABNORMAL!! I intend to report her and staff in violation of HIPPA right to access medical test results, then find another PCP. Bunch of idiots. I wish I never switched from Dr. Udayamurthy at Kelsey-Seybold (due to insurance issues)."

She always wears a smile and makes me feel at ease to discuss things with her.

He can be very awkward with patients and made me feel very unncomfortable the last few times I had an appointment with him. Find a different family practitioner if possible. In contrast, his staff are lovely and made me feel comfortable and not rushed as well as being speedy themselves. It is as if his staff with a different, decent doctor would be a dream combination. By all means please visit him and see for yourself but I would not waste your time with this socially awkward and seemingly under-skilled practitioner."

The kind that really cares. He's not a money hungry, fast pace, cold kind of doctor that we so often see these days. He is like family and treats me as such. When he prescribes a drug, it's because you really need it, not because he is pressured by pharmaceutical companies or for profit. He's always available. He listens to you. He is up to date, and recommends many preventable measures to insure good quality health. You can trust him, to work together with you, to make the best medical decisions for your health.

The lady at the desk called him to the window long story short she assumed he did not speak English and she was insisting that the Dr. could not see him if he did not speak English because they had no interpreter. My Mom was there and kept telling her he did in fact speak English and then to top it off she did not allow my Mom to go back to the room with my Dad. Which by the way if he did not speak English my Mom could have interpreted. Dumb***!!! Incompetent front office employees. By the way my Dad wears hearing aids and could not fully hear her so my Mom was answering for him.

Instead of helping me get to the root of the problem, he continued to dole out drugs to treat the symptoms and acted as if nothing out of the ordinary was wrong. I even asked him for a recommendation for an endocrinologist (not required as I have a plan that allows self-referrals), and he said ""I didn't need one."" "

He and his staff even worked with me when I had a gap in insurance coverage. He is helpful, listens carefully, and is very pragmatic in his practice/treatment. For instance, the few times that I have needed to have blood work done, he has made sure that he is not running tests that are not logical first steps, or a far fetched possibilities, so that you are not running up a bill for extraneous testing. If further steps need to be taken, Dr. Giglio will cross that bridge with you when the time comes. He was also very helpful when I happened to have a skin issue that he had never seen before. He referred me to a wonderful dermatologist, and made sure that it would be covered by my insurance company.

I feel as if he no longer cares and is merely going through the motions. Last 3 times I saw him he was either angry or frustrated and I was the recipient of his mood. He refuses to speak or see you unless you are willing to pay each time. This goes for simple refills. Sad to say he’s manners or lack of, rude staff and lack of general caring in helping has made me change doctors."

He was the first doctor to work with me to find the best medicine for my problem, and my migraines are still under control today. My family members drive across town to see him. We do discuss (even joke about) the fact that he is sometimes grumpy, and terribly frustrated with the state of government/healthcare/insurance, but I wouldn't trade him for any other family doctor.

I would change insurance companies first! I wish there was more room to tell the entire story. On my initial visit (Friday afternoon) I saw the doctor for bronchitis and he said he would call in my prescriptions; if I wasn't better by Monday - call. To my amazement, I was not given anything for the cough. I suffered through the weekend. When I called his office on Monday morning I was told it was not an oversight; and, I had to come back in if I wanted cough syrup (even though I was just there the previous Friday). I got in that afternoon and when I asked for cough syrup indicating that I had been getting bronchitis for 58 years and phenergan had worked in the past. He basically called me a narcotics hound saying he thought I was only there for the narcotics. I have never been so insulted or humiliated in my life. What an arrogant ASS!"

Turned out Dr. Thomas was still in the office and they had seen her sitting at the desk. The daughter was very upset because she said her mom had been falling A lot and that her mom did not like leaving the house often because she was afraid of falling while she was out. She said her dad was also in the hospital after having surgery and had not gone to see him that day because of appointment with Dr Thomas.

Although after some research, I realized at least some of his personal situation and what he was going through. I've been going to Dr. Thomas' office now for over two years and have never even see her. At first I was with Dr. Chua, who basically agreed with everything I asked of him and just continued what Dr. Maidenberg had prescribed. Then he left suddenly and I was turned over to a female Dr. Assistant (who I have to say is the only one in the office that seems to know anything). I was told there were no plans to hire another male doctor which did make me feel uncomfortable. I am still searching for a new PCP doctor and even though I'm sick right now, don't want to go back to Dr. Thomas' office. Have the feeling that she only wants female patients now, but if that's the case why not just spell it out for patients and recommend another doctor for male patients? Very unprofessional attitude in the office."

He did not say any thing about leaving or starting a new practice, when I returned for my follow up visit I was told he retired.I was MAD but more at Dr Maidenburg than Dr Thomas.

One is a physician assistant, not a nurse and the other one was the lab person who draws blood. She is great at her job. This office NEVER gives lab results in a timely fashion. In fact, I spent the entire day waiting to hear back after having called four times for results over the past three days. I am sure that Dr. T. knows her ""stuff"" but she does not communicate effectively with her patients.

I am very very saddened to say that the constant changing of his staff and his new partner have diminished the quality of care you would expect to receive there. not to mention Tadros himself...his bedside manner has become brusque and abrupt as thought to hurry up and get you out, you wait for an hour or more to be called in to the examining room and then wait another 40 minutes to see Dr. Tadros for a 5 minute appointment with him. I was prescribed medication by Dr. Tadros and when asked what some of the side effects were I was told to go online and look them up, He is quick to write a prescription and NEVER NEVER takes the time he used to with his patients..I will NEVER recommend him anymore...on the contrary I will make it my business to make sure no one in my family goes to him again!!!!"

He is very helpful and the office almost always runs on time. The longest I've waited is 30 minutes and he apologized profusely for making me wait so long. When I was having back pain he spent about 30 minutes trying to figure out the problem and then recommended some exercises that helped me a lot. He also gave me some good advice on pain meds to avoid and why they should be avoided. Very good doctor (as is Dr. Boctor)."
653,Dr. Magdy K. Tadros,Houston,Texas,Family Doctor / G.P., Male,6,3.9,2007-06-20T16:43:30Z,5,,5,5,5,"Dr. Tadros has been our family doctory for over 10 years. He is the best I've seen. He listens to you, and answers your questions to a level you'd understand. He is very compassionate and caring. His medical knowledge is outstanding. He has previous surgical experience which make him able to point you to the right direction. He knows when to be conservative and when to be agressive. Can't recommend him enough."

He will immediately refer to a specialist when required. P.S. To the person who complained he wouldn't prescribe antibiotics for a cold: He was RIGHT. A cold is a VIRUS - antibiotics are of absolutely NO USE....they are only effective for BACTERIA, you would NOT have died."

Please don't let them recommend him. I was so sick with a cold. Any other doctor would have given me antibiotics, but he didn't. I was shocked because I felt I was quite sick. After 2 days of total misery I went back and saw another doctor in the practice. He prescribed antibiotics immediately. I feel this doctor almost killed me. Please don't see him or let the staff recommend him."

We all run late sometimes - I don't know of ANY Dr's office that is on time with their appointments. The front receptionists have always been nothing but plesant and very friendly. Dr. Albers nursing staff is wonderful as well.

In the middle 1980s my son had kidney failure that was misdiagnosed by his pediatrician in Corpus Christi, TX. He was misdiagnosed several times.
We were visiting in Houston, TX when my son was really sick. We looked up a pediatrician in the phone book. We were so fortunate that we accidentally found Dr. Ziafat. Dr. Ziafat immediately discovered the problem. The Dr. took so much care of my son in such a professional way. I am eternally grateful that circumstances happened to have my son treated by Dr. Ziafat and I believe that the whole experience having Dr. Ziafat in fact was nit an accident. In my opinion Dr. Ziafat saved my sons' life.
I have so much respect for this man and I Get emotional writing this."

She is very nice, understanding, listens to what we have to say, and we love her. If she doesn't know something, she will defer to someone else for specialization. The only negative I can find is that she doesn't return calls; I know she is very busy when we are there, so I don't know if she is too busy or her staff doesn't give her messages. If it is an emergency, her staff can always fit you in. I wish more doctors were like her."

Let me say it again it is totally not right. I had to wait over 2hrs after arriving before my appointed time. If you call them after 3pm you will not get a person to answer the phone....That is crazy. They are short on staff which indicates that someone has dropped the ball on customer service. I have read this in other reviews as well. Going to have to go some where else. You have to staff your business to accommodate your business for your customers. Arrive at 9 on time and not seen until 10:30. Not working for me

A doctor is a good as her staff. At my first initial appointment I noticed how improper the staff was. But during the appointment Dr. Jordan's professionalism and care gave me the feeling that I could dismiss their disreputable appearance. But it wasn't until the follow up appointment that I knew that I'd made a mistake. Dr. Jordan's wonderful bedside manner was overshadowed by horrible staff. The entire staff need to be trained on professional etiquette, none of them should be in the human service or medical field. I've attempted numerous times to contact Dr. Jordan and I've NEVER received a call back."

Well, turns out they submitted my blood for a series of other tests that they couldn't explain why they did that weren't covered and I had to pay. And they sent my wife's exam to a lab that wasn't in my network so got a bill for that, even though the same test done the previous year was sent to a lab in-network and we had no problems with.

She is rushed and the staff is not interested in you, but she is worth the wait. I have started making appointments with her right after lunch or first thing in the morning so I don't have to wait.

He's worth the miles and his office staff is more than outstanding. The comment of "" he's quick to medicate"" may be some what true,but don't you think that its best to try to medicate before you're sent for some high cost evaluations that your insurance may not cover? He's just as cost conscience as the every day worker and he's always aware of what your insurance will cover and won't cover so if he's ""quick to medicate"" its not to send you off so he can take on another patient its to avoid you having a new problem...high blood pressure.

It was hard to talk to her and she is not a dr I would ever refer anyone to. Its not worth me ever returning. I paid cash for visits and never received free care. I always paid for my services its a shame I could not receive the same courtesy."

She and her staff actually call you with results and follow up to make sure your treatment was successful. She has by far been the best doctor I have ever been to; she truly cares about her patients.

She ordered my thyroid medication incorrectly (she wanted to switch what I had previously been taking) by not considering interactions with other medications, and it took over a week to get it called in correctly-- and much longer to re-stabilize my thyroid. Also, she sets her prices, and then got verbally angry that I expected to be charged what I was told I would be charged (got angry about ""how much time she spent with me""- but half of it was in the hall talking to another patient, and also looking up the codes for blood tests (thyroid antibodies) that she should know if truly a hormone expert, as she touts herself. Never responded to request for refill from the pharmacy for my Rx-- leaving me without my thyroid medication until I could find a new doctor (I was still her patient at that point-- but clearly did not return after this). And I never received the superbill to submit to insurance via fax that I was promised by the incompetent front desk. Oh, and the whole point of my second appointment was to put lidocaine into a scar-- but she ""didn't have time"" and wanted to me to reschedule (i.e., pay for another cash appointment)-- telling me she was sure it would really help me. I waited while she ran late with patients before me, but she didn't have time for my appointment or to do a procedure she thought would help my pain-- yet was angry with how much I was paying her. She literally spent 10-15 minutes with me, and acted like that was an overextension. Awful, disrespectful, pathetic, and financially motivated practice. Would not recommend even to a desperate person. "

I found Dr Pharo in 1990 & she literally SAVED MY LIFE! I know many of her patients say same thing! In my case, other docs had missed my major problem entirely! Whoever wrote neg-comments, especially the Sept 17, 2014 comment should GET THEIR FACTS CHECKED & that post should be Removed because it is slanderous Lie! Although I also thought something was happening to my great doc because around that time period she showed symptoms where she had trouble walking and her usual eloquent speaking voice was sometimes off. But I was smart enough to ask about it & Fact Check revealed she went through a serious life threatening illness that caused those symptoms! After a week in the hospital, working with her colleagues & doing her own good protocols she returned better than ever! I have been going to Dr Pharo for decades & everyone I sent her is still with her & thinks she's fantastic! Of course every bus has staff problems sometimes. Most important: You want a doc that tells you the truth, knows good medicine, spends a lot of time with you during office visit & follow ups & most certainly devoted to helping you get & stay healthy...Go To Dr. Pharo! She's 5 stars & more!"

She helped like no other physician I could find anywhere! Over 24+ years she did have some staff problems she resolved. Her current staff and new office location off 610 North is WONDERFUL! Most important she helped me with hormones, allergies, recovery from a botched surgery by another physician, solved my problems with anemia and other life threatening issues. You can trust her expertise, experience and compassion. She spends quality time with her patients and is extremely talented with her diagnostics and treatment plans she customizes for the individual patient. I don’t agree with any negative comments. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND going to Dr. Pharo because YOUR LIFE MAY DEPEND ON IT and I really know because she Literally ""SAVED MY LIFE""! Make your own appointment with Dr. Pharo, you won’t regret it!

I knows experts that she can call on to confer with or have you see. Her blood center is right across the hall and easy to get to. I did not find my waits long and the staff was very friendly and helpful. Her PA is also there to ask questions any time. I love going to see her. I am glad I switched.

Even though I wrote her off as just not a good doctor the first time i saw her for convenience and the sake of not filling out new patient paperwork at a new doctor i went again this year. I can honestly say this time it was even worse, I believe rather than be a doctor she needs to seek help. I would never ever recommend anyone to her and I don't care how far or long I have to drive or wait I will never go to this woman office again.

One staff member gave me some so the worse attitude I have ever experienced including talking about me to the triage person in front of me. The feedback from the office was that I came on a busy morning ( had an appointment and many going ahead of me, appointments are not important here ) and that many of the staff members were new. Called and spoke to the office manager about my experience and she told me my visit was discussed in front of the staff and there was nothing they could do to re-due it, no apology whatsoever.

I never have to wait more than 5 minutes before I see him. If I have an 11am appointment, I am usually out before 11:15. And I can almost always get a same-day appointment. He has a somewhat brusque bedside manner. I am organized and good at quickly summarizing my symptoms, and I don't like small talk, so I appreciate the way he works. However, I could imagine someone not liking him if they wanted a warmer and more personal experience."

Both my husband and I went to her for several years. Wait times are ridiculous. Her medical advice to my husband was questioned by several doctors. My husband switched to a different doctor a year ago. I decided to give her another chance. Dr. Mayekar, it is unfortunate that you do not value your patient's time. I am a mother of an autistic child. I missed my son's school meeting today, because you were too busy laughing and joking with a lady from your culture in an exam room. Yes, we could all hear you. You spent such a long time with her that even your staff kept apologizing for you. An hour and 20 minutes later, I had to leave and I did. I will not be returning. You probably don't care. I will find a doctor that cares and respects me, my time, my health, and values me as a patient. "

The girls in the front are rude, unprofessional, and immature. They mix up your appointment time and then give 'you' attitude for it. No one takes responsibility for the mistakes and they blame it on each other and YOU! This has happened to us over and over again and it's gotten to a point that we are looking to switch doctors.

Though her clinic insists on rigorous application of timely appointments that would put Cathay Pacific's flight record to shame, she really prefers to spend as much time with her patients as she can. She advocates all the standard wellness tests but is never overbearing about it. Frankly, if I had appendicitis, she could stick an elephant needle in me and scoop out the appendix with a cereal spoon and I wouldn't feel it. She's a sort of MD equivalent of Florence Nightingale. Seriously."

I don't want to leave and think about what should have been discussed or have more questions. Dr. Nguyen seems thorough, interested, and polite. It was my first time meeting her but I was impressed with her willingness to listen and discuss my background - I will be going back to her. Total Family Care seems to be able to do more procedures and I like that. It is always frustrating to go to the doctor and only end up to having to go see a specialist. I will be going back to see Dr. Nguyen."

I saw Dr. Lemming for my very first ""well woman"" exam. I was just short of 17 years old and in a (committed, monogamous) sexual relationship. Lemming disapproved of this, and oh boy did she make it clear. Keep in mind I'm 16 and going to my first GYN appointment, and I'm terrified. She was not kind or reassuring in any way and she did not smile. She scowled when I told her I had had sex and informed me that I was now at risk for cervical cancer (without explaining what she actually meant). She acted disgusted when she did my pelvic exam -- I mean I still, to this day, remember the ""ugh"" look on her face. I remember her assistant smiled at me because the tension was so obvious. She made me so ashamed of myself and my body as a young woman because she could not put her personal feelings aside and be a good doctor. I did not ask her for birth control because I wasn't comfortable. I still almost want to cry remembering this."

Very personable, one of the best I've had. I have no complaints at all on her services or care. Medical staff is also very good. They have in-house x-ray department. This is a major plus if you are paying your own bills. Big cost savings over being sent to the hospital for ""community x-ray services"". Office is in a good location, easy on-off from Interstate-10.  (Reception staff could use work however...a bit overbearing and bureaucratic at times). Overall though, a favorable Medical office. I would recommend Dr Lemming to anyone looking for a good doctor."

When I arrived on 12/9/10 I signed a form as I was a new patient of hers and paid a $25 co-pay. After waiting 20-30 min I was called to the desk by an assistant and told I owed approximately $15 dollar for an x-ray that was done with another Dr. at Kelsey Seybold. It was the first I heard of it and told them I would investigate it and pay it if it was owed. I was told to hold and then Phillesia Alexnder (Administrative Supervisor) came out and said she would have to speak with Dr. Bell to see if she would see me. She came back and said since I was only there for a examination that I would have to reschedule after I paid $15 dollars. I told her I did not know if there was something serious occurring but that’s why I wanted the physical because I had some chest pain. She repeated the Dr.(Bell) said that can be rescheduled.

It is now September and I am still having lifts and bends in the leg that he operated on my knee. Can't get any answers as to why. Some are very painful. Cannot walk without a walker. The neurologist he recommended never heard of this. Dr. Randall never heard of this. This has ruined my quality of life as I cannot get out and about. I would never recommend this doctor and I warn anybody who is going for knee surgery to steer clear of him. He had ruined my leg.

Have only seen doctor twice since and neither time does he take to time to listen to my concerns nor respond to them. I have had severe involuntary knee lifts and bends that his PA said were ""reflexes"" that they could do nothing about. I have these no less than three times a day. They are very painful and cause my knee to stiffen up. The first severe one was two weeks after my surgery and it caused me to fall at work. For two days, this happened multiple times. The pain was excruciating. The doctor acted unconcerned and had no answer as to why this is happening to me. Because of this, I dare not try to walk without a walker because the ""refexes"" are so severe, they cause me to lose my balance. I have fallen twice when I tried to use a crutch once and a cane once.I would never recommend this doctor."

She has someone to come in the room with her to write down all of the information that she’s telling the patient.

But now that I know why... she spent time with each patient and if she needs to talk with any of your other Doctors she get in contact with them to get answers and then she go back with you and talk with you. ...
How many of us we go to other Doctors and after waiting for them we go to the patient room they come in spent not even 5 minutes with you and basically you tell them what you think is wrong with you and they get out of the room without checking your vital signs!!!!"

In the waiting room, others were talking about how they had been waiting over an hour already, and that it was expected to wait a long time to see this doctor. I waited 1 hour and 30 minutes to be called back to the room, and then another 45 minutes in the exam room before I gave up to go back to work. i let the staff know that i needed to go back to work, and the doctor came and introduced herself to me. She did not apologize, or explain the significant delay. I am a physician myself, so I understand that delays sometimes happen, but I always apologize and explain to my patients in general what is causing the delay. So, I paid a 20 dollar co-payment to get vital signs taken, and paid 7 dollars to park because it was over 2 hours. I will not be back to see this doctor."

I had pain from my lower back radiating down my left leg. I could hardly walk on crutches. He ask how long and I said 6 months and getting worse. He did not prescribe anything and did not offer any advice. I ask if it could be a sciatic nerve pinch and he said ""could be"", but still offered nothing. NOT RECOMMENDED"

He always takes the time to really listen, and determine what might be going on. I have never had a problem with a referal to a specialist, nor as he ever trivialized any symptoms I may have had. He is a very caring person--something that many other doctors today need to learn. I highly recommend Dr. Feldman for your medical needs."

His patients are his number one priority. He takes time and closely listens to his patients and addresses all of their concerns. Our family members have been seeing him over three years and it proved us again and again that his diagnosis and treatment options are the most appropriate and the most accurate ones. He utilizes his remarkable experience in both Family Medicine and Sports Medicine for his patient's best interests, day-in and day-out. He encourages his patients to live active and healthier lives. Our family is very fortunate and thankful to have him as our Primary Care Doctor. We absolutely recommend Dr. Feldman to everyone who wishes to have a caring, experienced and dedicated doctor whom they could trust, for many years to come."

I've been his patient for years and followed him around every time he's changed practice. What I like about him is that he's not afraid to admit when he doesn't know about something & he has always refered me to great specialists who've been really helpful to me. Considering I have several medical conditions, what I've found w/ Dr. Feldman is that he actually does not use me as a guinea pig to try medications on. Even when I ask for medications, he offers me a prescription, but asks me to wait to see if I really need it. He always listens to me and values my input knowing that I've lived w/ my body longer than he's known me as a patient. He belives that I can give him insight as what may be wrong w/ me. He's made himself accessible to me through providing an email that I can actaully ask questions from him and give him reports on how I'm doing and he's quite responsive to the emails. I know I'm happy w/ him."

She is prompt when you have a an appt BUT,... She is fast to examine, makes you feel like you are holding her up from something else she could be doing. She does not contact you timely with lab or test results and has no sensitivity to her patients needs. I have been on hold for over an hour trying to reach her per a phone call she made to me and still no response until the call terminated. I expressed my nervousness of the results to the receptionist and it meant nothing. So, I am never going back to her nor would I refer my dog there.

Our appointment was for 3:30pm and they asked us to show up 20 minutes early for paperwork. When we got there, early as requested, there were 5 people there ahead of us. We filled out the paperwork with a very curt and receptionist who took our co-pay up front. We sat there until 4:30pm and they had only called 2 of the 5 people ahead of us in that entire time. They want us to be there early to fill out paperwork so we don't inconvenience them but then made us wait for over an hour with still no hope of being called in site. On top of the unfriendly staff and the wait, the waiting room is extremely tiny and when the any other person is coughing away with God-knows-what, the chance of getting whatever they have is increased 10 fold because we're all crammed into a tiny space. After being made to wait an hour, my husband and I asked for a refund on our co-pay and left. Do not got there unless you don't mind being coughed on and treated bad."

She is very patient and is a very personable individual. She is extremely knowledgeable and you feel as if you can tell her anything. Her staff is horrible and rude. It took 3 days for the ""nurse"" to call me back on one simple question. I've recommended numerous people to her because I trust Dr. Perez.

I got a blood, saliva and urine test send to the labs and gave me some medicine for free (I think they were samples) and within 3 weeks, the lump went away. I was not able to get away with the pain though for all that time. The staff was great (only one assistant, I think is his nephew) I was surprised how efficient he was because nobody was there on a saturday morning. The doctors visit overall was no more than 15 minutes. He usually charges $250 for new patients but charged me only $150 because I had no insurance. Few weeks later, I had to pay for the analysis but I am OK with that because I have piece of mind and know my lab results came out ok."

Doctor Hung, makes great efforts to get to know you as a person, in order to help you holistically as a person.

Generous with samples of new drugs he prescribes for testing for side effects before the prescription is filled.

She doesn't listen , didn't even look at my conditions that thoroughly and seemed in a rush. She is also rude, very close-minded and and shows no sympathy towards her patients. Worse doctor I ever experienced, and this is from hundreds of doctors I've had and 30 times in a hospital for my conditions. She chose the wrong profession and needs to be booted out of practice."

Rude, does not explain well and then she roles her eyes when you ask questions, she has an attitude and she talks to you like you are stupid. She is in rush like you disturbed her while she was busy doing something else, she barely touched me to see what's wrong! She was the worst dr i have ever seen! I felt even worst after I came out of her office! I was better off throwing my miney in the trash!"

I went for one thing (migraines), she billed my insurance with another diagnosis and my insurance won't cover payment for labs. I have tried multiple times to reconsile the problem with the office. She is unwilling to discuss/assist. Besides that, it took the office 3 days to get my Rx sent to the pharmacy (b/c she presecribed a medicine NOT on my approved medication list) The facility is nice, but the doctor is probably the worst I have ever been too. Referring a woman who weighs 160pounds for gastric bypass surgery. RIDICULIOUS!"

Both times I've been there she rushes in and out and doesn't let me ask questions. The first time I needed a referral to a cardio but as I was there I told her about migraines that started getting worse, she told me to ask my cardiologist! when I did he looked at me like I was stupid & told me to ask my regular dr. no duhhh. I just forgot the problem for a while but the migraines got even worse so I went back & she barely let me speak & rxd me antimigraine meds. I picked them up and the label says NOT for patients w heart conditions and it listed my particular condition. I could have gotten seriously hurt because she failed to even remember my condition. terrible bedside manner, doesnt listen could've hurt me! 2 x' ive been the office was empty & I heard nurses talking about how it's always slow. wonder why!!"

She's knowledgeable, thorough, caring and professional. The problem I have is not with her but her receptionist. The current one is sort of new 'cause I already went through two receptionists. The first one was quite good and the second one was really awesome. The current one sounds very blunt and even rude. I have made several phone calls since she was hired. Every time I called Dr. Yang's office, I always hung up with a very bad taste coming from her. I know it sounds a bit strange because I am looking for a new doctor due to a blunt receptionist, but I don't want to feel uncomfortable every time I call the office."

I told her that I had physical about 1 month ago and I am fine. She started telling me that after this shot I ""can not be intimate with cancer patients, if you know what I mean"", but never mentioned about precautions with my 8 mon old grandson (Thanks, doc). Finally her nurse gave me vacsine. It was different from other nurces and very painful for the next week, she has never rubbed the muscle"

This included putting in my credit card. The desk staff assured me the credit card would only be used for my copay, with my consent. I was then handed information for the Hello Health Portal Connect, which I had apparently just signed up for, which includes a yearly charge of $60. I was informed that this was to support an electronic medical record system provided for free to Dr. Yang, who receives part of the yearly fee (Hello Health materials) and may receive up to $44,000 from CMS for implementing an EHR. Why should I pay for a business investment that will net Dr. Yang increased revenues and/or government money? It was offensive and ridiculous to come for a medical appointment and be tricked into signing up for Portal Connect, which has no relevance to the care I was seeking. Dr. Yang seemed quite knowledgeable and kind, but I will not return. This is very unprofessional."

However, I always go back to see her for my annual checkup as long as the insurance can work out. Dr. Yang is very knowledgeable and explains well what the reasons behind. She always points out tests or shots that you need but other doctors might miss. And recently I have my mom signed up her Concierge Program so that she can spend more time with the doctor and be well taken care of. Dr Yang is the best doctor I have known of and gives me confidence and trust to put my health in her hands."

I aree that she is very quick to say if she thinks you need to see a specialist after she's done all she can. It's nice having a dr admit that your medical problem is out of their area of medicine. I've been fortunate enough to not have to wait that long when I've seen her.

Doesn't really care too much for his patients after he sneeks out the back door and calls it a day. Very dissappointed and would never recomend him to even my worst enemy.

The best thing about Dr. Hussein is his bedside manners. He actually takes the time to listen to my problem and explains all my options for treatment. He puts me at ease and I literally feel like I'm talking to my dad or grandfather. The wait time can be a little long but that's expected with any doctor's office. His staff is also very nice. I trust Dr. Hussein with my health and have referred many friends and co-worker to him."

He knows his stuff and is very smart. I had a spider bite that was not going away after I had seen multiple doctors. Doctor Pool immediately recognized it and knew exactly how to treat it. Two days later it was no longer noticeable. I have not looked back to other doctors since. The only downside is the wait, make an early appointment and that will help."

Dr. Pool knows what he is doing, but by the time I left he'd spend very little time (only 3 minutes) with me; he was always in a hurry to see the next patient. He does, however, know his stuff and his diagnoses and treatments were always effective. His practice grew too large and he is simply too busy for my liking."

She harasses you and expects you to be happy with her referring you out to doctors left and right. She doesn't thoroughly listen, she just wants you in and out so she can charge your insurance.

They do not go out of their way to help patients AT ALL. My wife and I both had appointments scheduled, and I requested to have our appointments switched because my wife's issue is more important than mine. We were first off, denied the request without given any reason, and were treated very rudely on the phone when we asked if we could speak to Dr. Laursen herself. We were told, quote ""Dr Laursen is too busy seeing patients and when she is done at the end of the day, she files her paperwork and GOES HOME TO HER KIDS."" The last part was vocally emphasized like it was supposed to make me feel bad or something. We have been going here for years, but not anymore. -The Wrights"

After she left the room, I had a question for her (she never gave me an opportunity to ask any) and I heard her and the nurse talking outside my room. The nurse told Dr. Laursen that I had a questions, and she said, well, what is it? Nurse: I don't know, she didn't tell me. 5 minutes later she comes back in the room.

I tried to steer the conversation back to me and the reason for my visit. I told him that I am not into politics. He kept steering the conversation back to politics and his personal life. He told me that I should not vote for Donald Trump and that Donald Trump's people are racists. There were several uses of the word crackerhead.

Here's the deal. Don't go there asking for meds to ""cure"" something that is better managed through a lifestyle change. If your knees hurt because you are overweight, he may give you meds in the short run, but then will tell you to lose the weight. If you are offended by that approach, don't go here.

I have never seen anything quite like in my life. I can't figure it out. I seriously think the office policy is NOT to return phone calls under any circumstances, unless it's to schedule another appointment. Other doctors I use (ob/gyn, my children's pediatrician) will call back within hours of a call to their office. Why wouldn't they? You are their patient calling with a question. I truly don't understand the disconnect between the attentiveness in the office and total and utter lack of care after you leave the office. It's baffling to me. Either the staff is utterly incompetent and should be fired OR non-communication by phone is office policy. Unfortunately, I believe the latter is true and Dr. Irvine only cares about one thing - your copay."

I called HEB that night and they said they didn't have the RX's. Called Dr's office who said it could take up to 4 hours for the RX to be electronically transmitted to HEB...(it was already over 4 hours). It's been 3 days since my apt. and HEB still doesn't have the RX from the Dr. This office has lousy follow-up/customer service...I give up...I'm changing to a dr. that is concerned enough about their patients to call them back and send in rx's in a timely manner. For over 2 weeks the dr. has admitted he doesn't know what's wrong with me but still continues to write me RX's....in what world does that make sense?"

Wait time is horrible.He is a very nice guy/very personable. However, as a Doc over past few years he's changed. Has prescribed incorrect meds to both my husband & I causing some horrible issues. During you visit he rattles on about other things as he is examining you, which I believe is the reason for his mistakes. I never get a call back about my lab results. There just doesn't seem to be any care there for the patient after the visit. It's like you've left his office andnow your done."

The office will not complete prior authorizations for prescriptions of needed medications under any circumstances. You learn of this policy when you call and select the option for prescriptions - it is on the voice mail recording. The nurse wouldn't call me back. I finally got the front office staff to get her on the phone and she was rude with me about the side effects I was having because of being off the medication. I had to wait an hour to see him even when there were no other patients in the waiting room the entire time I was there."

This medication is for high BP and I have been on this medication under his supervision for 4 years. His office would not call in a weeks worth of BP medication so I wouldn't run out while HE is not in the office this week. The office staff also will NEVER call you back.

His practice has grown so much that you end up waiting a long time now. He also took my husband off of metformin (diabetes) for intolerance issues, but failed to give him another RX. Had to go back to see him after my husband failed a physical for a new job because his sugar was too high. An oversight that was costly to us."

My dad went to urgent care the night before for unable to control muscle in his body, back pain, and blurred vision. They told him that he might have a possible TMI and to see his family doctor, and if the symptoms occur again before seeing family doctor, to go to the ER. He also sent his report to Dr. Chan. The next morning, when my dad went in to see her, she basically blew off the urgent care doctor and said that my dad was fine based on his history. She did do some blood work urine test, and prescribed him pain medication, and send him home to wait for the result. My dad had another episode that night and died in the ER. If it might have been a TMI, why didn't she send him to the ER right away? Why did she blew off what the urgent care doctor had said? When my mom went to Dr. Chan's to pick up paperwork, she did not mention my dad's passing and acted like it didn't happen. That is not very compassionate to me."

I went to her 3 or 4 times complaining about back pain and feet pain. She finally referred me to someone. Turns out I have disc bulges and tarsal tunnel. She told me it was just anxiety!

To give some background, I came in for an annual check-up after a year of making healthier choices in regard to smoking (quit for good 5 months ago!!), alcohol, diet, and exercise and was feeling pretty good about where I am health-wise and excited to share my progress. My initial focus was on creating and fostering healthier habits for myself, with less focus on superficial concerns about my actual weight number (which as modern science attests, is not a singular determining factor of overall health).The wait for my appointment was admittedly short, but Dr. Siegler rushed to complete the exam and barely looked at me or listened to a word I said throughout the exam. He asked me zero questions about my diet or exercise habits. In fact, the only question he asked me was about current medications. As he tried to quickly leave the room I asked him if I could discuss something that was bothering me. Before I even had a chance to explain that I was concerned about anxiety issues that I have dealt with for over 10 years (and have been diagnosed with by a doctor), he proceeded to lecture me about how ""fat people are fat for a reason"" and advised that I ""do not eat on Mondays, Wednesdays & Fridays, but eat whatever you want on the other days."" I explained that I actually eat very healthy now compared to in the past and he kept saying ""you can't overeat and expect to lost weight"" and saying things like ""well trying isn't doing."" Let's just ignore the fact that I went from NEVER exercising to hitting the gym 5 times a week, and primarily cooking from home instead of eating out! He also suggested that i keep a good log but that he knew i would lie. I was really confused since he hadn't brought up my weight, I hadn't expressed any desire on my part to lose weight, or change my diet habits whatsoever, but I initially tried to let it go and move past the comments. As he was walking me out of the examination room, I asked ""but am I healthy?"" and he said in a cold tone ""sure, except that you're fat."" I was visibly and audibly upset and he just walked away from me. While checking out with the receptionist (who even brought me some kleenex) I became more upset, until Dr. Siegler came back to talk to me some more. After bringing me back into the exam room he proceeded to repeat that I should try fasting, telling me I would feel better if I would just lose some weight, etc. He said things like ""it was just a joke"" and ""I'm sorry that you are sensitive about this,"" all statements that in my opinion serve to blame me for being upset rather than admitting his own accountability for unnecessarily bullying me about my weight. He even told me to smile at the end....UGGGGHHH!!! I do not see in any way how this is a respectful or caring manner in which to serve patients seeking to better their lives by way of bettering their health. I have seen him times before and have never been treated so poorly. I would not recommend this doctor to my worst enemy after today."

He does take last minute Appstek which you expect for a GP since people don't schedule sickness. He does seem rushed and not very social but angers questions I have. Generally good referrals when needed. Although I have been seeing him for years' he would not share an off hours email nor number even when asked.

The doctor is known for his curt personality - some may take it as rude, but it's just his style, so okay fine - just wish I knew that before I asked him how he was doing. Every time, I wait 1 hour in the waiting room. His staff are horrible, and each time I checked out, I got a long story about how they're too busy to do my referral, or submit my prescription. In fact, this long story about their work environment is none of my business. But then days go by and no referral and no prescription. I tried to call them and remind them and before I could leave my call-back she hung up on me. Finally, lots of pro TRUMP political signs. I really swell place all in all."

He has a nice, clean, and well kept office and he employs excellent staff. I like that Dr. Siegler spends time to discuss my health with me and I can actually understand what he is saying. He is very down-to-earth as you will discover this right away when you meet him. Dr. Siegler has helped me over the years improve my health which is the main reason I give him a 5 star rating."

He was very inconsistent--one visit he would be great, the next he'd be awful. He did an in-office surgery on my foot for an infected toenail without giving me any antibiotics. The toe developed an infection, and when I went back the next week to have that treated, he asked me if he had done the surgery!! Then, based on my symptoms (pain and heat and swelling), diagnosed a potentially broken toe despite my saying (3 times!) I hadn't hit it, then he sent me home. The next day a different doctor diagnosed a potentially serious staph infection which was probably the result of the surgery and put me on antibiotics, which eventually cleared it up. I will not see him again, and I recommend others pass him by as well."

He never takes his time to listen to your concerns. He rushes you in and out. I went to his office because I had flu like symptoms. As soon as he got in the exam room, he used his stethoscope to check my lungs. (he asked me to breath in and out about 4 times) When he was through, he asked me to hop off the bed and follow him out!! :( He wrote prescriptions for antibiotics and that was it! He never even checked my temperature or anything. When I finally got home, my temperature sored to 102! What an awful doctor. I'm in the process of finding another primary physician. Trust me...you do not want Dr. Siegler!"

The wait times are ridiculously long and don't put it past them to stick you in a supply closet while you wait, that's what happen to me. I was treated like a new patient, asking the same routine preliminary questions you are asked when you see a doctor for the first time. This was my 3rd visit at this office. After a repeat of questions I remained in said closet for another 10 minutes before having my blood drawn. Then I waited another 10 minutes to be told I could leave and the doctor wouldn't be seeing me. Oh and my prescription. The nurse asked for the pharmacy phone number, I explained it was the same pharmacy they had sent the prescription too on Friday of the week prior (this the following Wednesday), as she looked it up in the computer, I googled the address and phone. Gave the nurse the phone number and address and had her confirm that she had the correct information. She said ""I do and am sending over the prescription right now"". An hour later I receive a phone call from the pharmacy...the wrong pharmacy. I called back to the office because I wanted them to correct their mistake, but the office was closed. The answering service (a guy in a convertible) took my information (twice) and said they would take care of it. They did not. I called the next day to the office to have them contact the correct pharmacy and they were rude and said that it wasn't their fault and that I needed to get it straightened out. RUDE STAFF. EXTREMELY UNPROFESSIONAL. What Dr. Burton doesn't realize is that her incompetent staff makes her look unprofessional herself.

She has multiple clinics and is only at the Cairnway clinic Tuesday mornings. You will see a different person each time you come. I want a doctor, not a nurse practitioner. The office is full of nurse practitioners and the copay is the same whether you see a nurse practitioner or the M.D., who is rarely in the office. The staff is overworked and the office is understaffed. Expect long waits, even if you have an appointment. The doctor is not very good with following up with patients."

It seems like she wants to get them in and out as soon as possible - like fast food for the medical industry! Her nurse was VERY rude, and didn't even respond to a question I had. When I asked the question again, she got very belligerent and gave me a non-answer. Then doctor Chen walked into the office like she was in a hurry, didn't introduce herself to me (we were there for my husband) or even look at me for that matter. When she talked to my husband, she stared down her nose at him almost like she didn't like him, and her responses to his questions were rude and aggressive. We both left there asking ourselves why she would treat us that way. Did we do something to upset her? I don't know, maybe she's just an angry person, but we will NEVER go back. And I'm going to leave a review like this on as many sites as I can to get the word out."
1200,Dr. Yee-Ru Chen,Houston,Texas,Family Doctor / G.P., Female,3,3.33,2014-03-03T14:33:20Z,5,5,5,5,5,I haven't been to the Dr. in a long time as I never ever get sick. So when I had signs for Strep I called Kelsey-Seybold and they gave me Dr. Chen. When I got there to check-in it was fast and I sat down for a few minutes before the nurse called me back. Asked a few questions and said the Dr. would be right with me. Literally 5 seconds after the nurse left she Dr walked in very nice and polite. She asked about my issued checked me based on my symptoms I explained and in less than 5 minutes I had a prescription to get rid of my strep throat. I found her very able to answer all my questions and concerns. Going in to the Dr appointment I was hoping this would be a Dr I could call my primary care Dr since I haven't had or needed one. And I think I got a good one. I'd recommend Dr. Chen to anyone.
1201,Dr. Yee-Ru Chen,Houston,Texas,Family Doctor / G.P., Female,3,3.33,2010-08-02T16:15:59Z,3.3,2,5,2,4,"She was very polite and on time. She was very thorough and ordered many tests. However, even after the work up, she did not adequately address any of my medical concerns or treat anything. During the actual appointment she expected the test results to come back as they did and suggessted a treatment plan at that time. Instead of following up with that plan, She referred me to specialists before even discussing the results of the tests with me. The office staff seemed friendly in person, but on the phone they were extremely rude. I would recommend her to go to if you need a referral but not if you require any treatment."

I call and they wouldn't want to answer any questions and immediately rushed me off the phone. If she hires a staff that won't give new patients the time or day then she might be losing lots of new patients.
1203,Dr. Sylvia Wu,Houston,Texas,Family Doctor / G.P., Female,3,4,2008-08-08T22:02:18Z,5,5,5,5,5,"I was very impressed by Dr. Wu.

Dr. Foox is a gentle soul with an old school approach to bed side mannor. He always gives the best references for specialists. The wait time may be longer than expect it, but that is b/c he does not rush and gives you his full attention.

Tried calling the doctor and staff just gave attitude, put me on hold and would not let me speak to the doctor. Finally went in and I was able to speak to the doctor and the only he said was he's not responsible for the costs that were passed onto me, bc most insurance covers it on annual basis. When I asked why his staff or his practice does not verify what tests are covered prior to administering all these, he said it's too time consuming and costly.

First impressions are very important for me and and my first phone call was bad. Attitude from the beginning. Then my husband and I came in, it was no better. The same lady Ms. Ruth that made my appointment was just as rude and unconcerned as she was before. And for God's sake why is the TV always so loud? You can't even hear them call your name. My husband came in for a sinus infection and was given medicine and had to come back the following week because the medicine didn't work and had to pay another co pay for the same thing. Instead of having a different prescription sent to CVS Dr. Slaughter had him come in again! Will not be coming back and will never recommend!

Office staff is very rude even when just calling to set an appointment. Dr Slaughter had me waiting 45 minutes past my scheduled time and did not return a prescription to one of my medical suppliers for so long I actually had to change doctors to even get the prescription filled again. I do not recommend Dr Slaughter to anyone.

I had about 3 visits to this doctor & they stated my pressure was high (which I knew), but she told me I needed to come in for a physical before I could get a prescription. My last doctor gave me a prescription on my very first visit! I had my physical done w/Dr Slaughter in May 2008 and they called me in July 2008 to give me my lab results. By then, I'd already changed my doctor. When I told the MA I'd changed my doctor, she didn't even care enough to ask me why so they can change or evaluate their processes.

I am amazed that Dr. Slaughter & her staff easily lose patients' forms & medical documents. It takes weeks & months to get her to complete medical exam forms given to her by patients. To make matters worse, she does not call you back & her staff don't return calls, & then she expect you to return for a second visit and pay before you can get the result of your blood test. How about the endless hours you have to spend waiting to see her? You have to devote a whole day to see her - very bad.

I've been a patient with her for almost 11 maybe 12 years. Unlike some of these doctors she spends time with her patients and actually cares about them and their well being. That's the only reason she is sometime behind or scheduled times because she likes to make sure every patient is accounted for in the right way.

Then I advised the lady what I was calling for. Mrs Ruth states “ well I don’t know what that is, I’m sure the doctor will know” , I sch my app since this was the only doctor what will see me today . Tried calling back several times to see if I could resch my time, the line was busy for 10+ min (I have never known an office that did not have more than 1 line. Finally I got through (again she answered on speaker) , sound like she was eating. I just canceled the whole appoint. That is one business the doctor has lost because of the lack of professionalism the staff has, I didn’t even make it in the office. If it was that bad just calling. I don’t even want to imagine how it is going in. Ill save my gas. NOT a good look for the doctor."

However they said they wouldn't ever go back because of the messy office that looked unclean.I left because he wouldn't return my calls over a medication issue and I lost trust in him.

This cost several thousand dollars, and untold distress to me and my husband. The extravagant exercise benefited only her office via excessive office calls. She is a brassy, condescending, woman. She possesses an imperious, domineering personality that demands a patient’s submission to her edicts such as abandoning my only beverage, tea.

I have been there twice and he is knowledgeable and fast. He has determined the issue and explained a course of action. The front desk staff is no nonsense if not a little cold, but they are efficiant. They could be a little nicer to people coming in - would be a reccomendation. These same complaints are echoed on google reviews. Otherwise a good general practitioner."

There were no problems getting an appointment at the time I needed. Dr Reed has only been a dr for a short time but knew exactly how to do a thorough exam and that more needed to be done. Because my broken bone was so bad and in a complicated place I needed an orthopedic surgeon. Instead of continuing to treat me beyond his ability he referred me to a specialist. He even gave me my xrays to take for the orthopedic surgeon. His staff gave me information for two different specialists. It was nice to have an option of who to see. My problem was in the hand/wrist area and one of the drs was a knee dr while the other was a very experienced hand orthopedic surgeon. Not sure why they referred me to a knee dr for a wrist problem, but they also referred me to a wrist dr. I did my home work and went to the wrist specialist, who is also very good. Thanks for a great referral."

I wanted to ask him something after I left the clinic and the receptionist told me there is no way to talk to him directly. We'll see if he does his homework. It is the first time I see him so, for now, I will be neutral. I felt like one more patient but will hold my comments until next time."

At first, he came across as being quiet and cold, but seeing him after the first time, I've realized he is just a little quiet. However, he is a good doctor, and will do his best to help figure out health problems with all necessary tests. He strikes me as a no-BS guy that will listen to you and just get the tests done. Many other doctors spend most of their time lecturing you on things irrelevant. I would recommend him to anybody who is having health problems and needs rapid and thorough testing for diagnosis."

Seemed like she was more interested in running up a bill with multiple visits and justifying small med changes with lab fees rather than understanding that I had been stable and on the same meds for years. When I confronted her directly with my supposition of her only interested in running up a bill, I got this response, ""if we don't see patients we don't get paid and if we don't get paid, we can't continue to operate."" I have finally been able to transfer back my Dr. I was seeing before. Hope to never have to see this Dr. again. "

She knows I am taking a prescription that is dangerous to discontinue abruptly, yet was fine with expecting me to reschedule to see her (NO other BFM doctors) more than two weeks later--going several days without my medication. I feel as if my health is not important at all to this physician."

You never get to see her & you spend forever waiting when you get to the office. I felt like she never listened to me and she never returned phone calls. The other thing I didn't like was that she seemed tooo tied to certain prescriptions (money perhaps) even if they weren't working she wasn't willing to try something else."

I had to stop seeing him due to my financial situation at the time but Dr. Powers was great! He didn't make me feel like an addict and he would talk with me not at me or down too me. And yes he may have ADHD but he still cares and will help u in any way he can. If ur not happy with him let him know and he will go out of his way to fix the problem.
1312,Dr. Jason Z. POWERS,Houston,Texas,Family Doctor / G.P., Male,2,3.5,2011-07-29T18:11:36Z,2,3,2,1,2,No bedside manner-no compassion. Arrogant and easily distracted (I swear he has ADHD). Sees clients as numbers and not individuals-treats all patients the same. Had side effects on medications and wouldn't discuss them over the phone or prescribe anything to help with side effect without another appointment. He is all about money. If you have addiction issues see a psychiatrist certified in addiction medicine. There are plenty of good ones in Houston/Dallas area.

There are more rules written on the walls like “Cash only”, “we don’t give Pain meds”, We don’t have a fax or e-mail” etc. they have been rude to me and everyone that goes to that office every time I have gone.

He's not in a rush (if you're on time) and he listens to you making eye contact. He doesn't just write a prescription and send you on your way without getting lab work first, if necessary. He will tell you o not eat a lot of Mexican food if oure overweight! Haha."
1333,Dr. Bhavana Rao,Houston,Texas,Family Doctor / G.P., Female,1,4.5,2010-08-09T11:02:25Z,4.5,3,5,5,5,Dr Rao is a great communicator. She takes time to listen and explain her diagnosis and treatment options. She oreders test and labs when needed. Dr Rao is easy to talk to and leaves her patients feeling good about their visit. Dr Rao works at the Conroe Lone Star Family Clinic. My ony compaint is that the support staff is hard to get a hold of. When you call Dr. Rao's nurse it always goed to voicemail. She might call you back in 24 hors i yor lucky There is poor follow up on calls. Dealing with the support staff is exhausting and annoying. It takes 3 days and 5 calls to resolve issues that can be solved in 30 seconds.This is not a reflection on Dr. Rao though. She seems to be the solution to making the support staff work harder. It will improve as Dr Rao gains more seniority and responsibility at the clinic. I rate Dr. Rao as AAA+++++ 10 out of 10.

Dr. Toll gave me a fatal diagnosis a year ago when I went in for a routine exam. She sent me to see a specialist for the condition she said I had but did absolutely NO FOLLOW-UP on my results with the specialist until a year later. She had no record of who she referred me to see nor did she have anything in her system indicating that she received the results from the specialists office.

She was not at all interested in finding out what was wrong. She never diagnosed me or examined me... only asked where she should send the prescription to. Once I stopped her and asked what she thought it might be that was causing severe pain in my back, she stated that it was a pulled muscle... I argued and said that there was absolutely no way that a pulled muscle would have occured off and on over the last 12 years. Needless to say I mentioned several times that my SI joint was extremely inflamed and the pain was radiating down my leg. She left it at that still insisting that it was a pulled muscle... offered no additional comments and no referrals to a specialist. Every question I asked her she responded with, ""I don't know."""

She never explains the side effects of the medecine she prescribes me. When I told her I read from reliable source that it was potentially harmful and had many side effects she brushed my concern aside without explanation. She seems rushed at every single appointment (and I have seen her 6 times). A very nice and polite lady but she does not seem to care at all for me as a patient and has no willingness to ask any questions about my medical symptoms other than what the nurse has typed in her computer.

I was having side effects from a drug she gave me and instead of realizing it was a side effect - (Zoloft - horrible diarreah and insomnia) she continued having me take the Zoloft along with medicine for insomnia and diarreah. It was a vicious sycle until i took myself off the Zoloft and the side effects stopped. I felt she was off in another world sometimes. But a very sweet lady."

Quick in-n-out, no chat, not willing to even comment on a topic not listed on the appointment form. Not very osteopathic. Was told that the prescription would be called in by 2:45. At 4:40 when I went to pick it up - NO PRESCRIPTION WAS CALLED IN. Frantically called the office at 4:40 before closing to be sure to get my child's prescription called in so he would be able to participate in his sport Monday, but was told the doctor had already left for the weekend. Long drive for a Friday, missed 1/2 day of school and work...etc... and nothing was accomplished. So frustrating!"

After waiting for 40 minutes, the doctor came in, I explained the reason for my visit and was very surprised when she did not check my body at all. Instead, she asked if I had any areas of concerns, a showed two moles that had appeared and that was it. She spent 5 minutes with me and I spent the most useless $20 of my life. Will never return."
1375,Dr. Silvia Sedrak,Houston,Texas,Family Doctor / G.P., Female,3,2.83,2012-06-07T10:31:31Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr Sedrak was very attentive, explained everything very well and was open to any question.

i've gone. She has questionable business practices, I made an appointment, only needed to address two minor issues. She said only 1 per day causing me to return the next day, pay another copay and she gets to charge blue cross again too. Blue cross took a fraud report from me. When I asked blue cross they said that was not a policy. I chose a more ethical doctor."

She came into the room, apologized for the wait, then immediately began firing questions at me, as if it were a speed round on a game show. She cut me off repeatedly as I answered her questions in order to ask me the next question. She gave me incorrect information about menopausal night sweats and incontinence. Terrible experience."

I was discharged with only enough medication for 2 days. I went to see Dr. Mellender and were she refused me herself and through a nurse was told make a follow-up appointment for a month later. My condition is Cervical Radiculopathy with a pinched nerve and is extremely painful and which requires immediate attention. Dr. Mellender should have visually seen me and then refer me to a proper surgical doctor for treatment.
1382,Dr. Ray A. Denson,Houston,Texas,Family Doctor / G.P., Male,1,4,2013-07-12T10:29:21Z,4,4,2,5,5,"Even though the wait time is long due to being walk-ins only, Dr. Denson is extremely knowledgeable and very thorough. Since he was previously a pharmacist, he will give you the medeciit, if he has it, at no cost to the patient. I've been a patient for over ten years."
1383,Dr. Lakshmi Seshadri,Houston,Texas,Family Doctor / G.P., Female,1,4,2009-02-20T20:36:43Z,4,3,4,4,5,She was a very good doctor when I saw her in her office. But either she does not return phone calls or her staff do not give her messages. Her staff is very rude when you call the office.

I finally got to see the doctor 45 minutes after my appointment time, and she was less than helpful (Dr. Medina works in Dr. Garcia's practice). I had two very specific concerns that I wanted to address with her, but she wasn't interested in talking about either one of them. I was very disappointed in her performance, and I really feel like I went there for nothing. "

It is now 25 minutes after my appointment time, and I am still waiting in the lobby. I have been coming to this clinic for several years, and although I have been less than satisfied, I have continued to come due to the convenience of the location. I will certainly start my search for a new primary care physician after this appointment."

Never gave heads up when she was oded down. Wanted me to do illegal things. Gave me meds at 3 times recommended allowance. Staff was rude. It goes on an on. Call me at 409.626.6769. I was there 8 years. I coukd tell you some things
1403,Dr. Linda J. Roos,Houston,Texas,Family Doctor / G.P., Female,2,3,2012-04-24T23:58:04Z,5,5,5,5,5,I have been going to Dr. Roos since 1997. She is the best Dr. that I have veer seen in a very long time. She does a through exam and has the vest of the best bed side manners. She takes all the time that is need. Never ever has she rush you out like (ALL OF THE OTHER DOCTORS) the others are all about the money not about all your health problems. In my books from 1 to 100 she is past that she is way over a 100. She really cares so much for her patients...which now days is hardly heard of. I would recommend Dr. Roos to any one. And I would definitely put my life in her hands no questions ask. All I can say is God Bless you Dr. Roos your the #1 and have really made a change in my life.God Bless you and your very working assistance's

1405,Dr. Bradley H. Hough,Houston,Texas,Family Doctor / G.P., Male,2,3,2012-03-31T13:57:14Z,1.5,1,1,2,2,The receptionists and nurse for this doctor were horrible. My waiting time was over two hours. I felt that I was treated very unfairly. I arrived 20 minutes early as I always do and watched 5 other patients go before me when they had arrived after my appointment time. Dr Hough is a very caring physician but does not know how to allot his time. I would try another doctor at the Houston North west Primary care but will not go there again because the staff was the worst I have ever come across. I almost think they thought it as funny that they put me last..and all I had was a medication check..a 10 minute visit and any good nurse would have directed the doctor to someone with a short visit as opposed to a lengthy problematic patient. I will not use this doctors off ice again..an I have been a patient of record for over 25 years with them..It makes me very sad.
1406,Dr. Sarah V. Simmons,Houston,Texas,Family Doctor / G.P., Female,2,3,2008-04-24T15:42:31Z,4,5,5,3,3,"Her nurse is AWESOME, very nice and caring. Dr. Simmons is nice, however, she is too quick to write a prescription without looking into the root of the problem and doesn't spend much time with you."
1407,Dr. Sarah V. Simmons,Houston,Texas,Family Doctor / G.P., Female,2,3,2008-04-18T12:44:55Z,2,3,2,1,2,She doesn't investigate problems at all. She wants to write a prescription for everything. She is very friendly though.

I had to appeal her decision to code my routine office visit and related lab test as linked to a bone and cartilage disorder. It was resulting in over $600 of bills at my expense when I have insurance to cover routine preventative visits and tests. She based the decision on a very minimal result of oesteopenia which is not considered a bone disorder and is treatable by taking calcium + D. She sees patients out of order when an appointment has been made. She does not respond well to queries and refuses to alter previous decisions. My deductible was $1,200 per year but routine well adult office visits and tests are covered 100% when the doctor codes things the way they should be coded. After sending results to Aetna they agreed that the doctor was incorrect. She also called me 'skinny' when my weight is exactly correct for my height. I should be permitted to charge her for the time I spent on phone calls, faxes and communication over her bad decision."

The staff was not friendly, all grumpy faces. I had nasal blockage, she didn't even take a look at my ear, throat and nose, nor checked on my lungs with a stethoscope. She gave me a sample for nose spray. That's it! I asked for something to help me sleep since I've had an average of 2-3 hours of sleep only. She said she wanted to see my blood work first. This is rather irrelevant, but what kind of doctor would wear spike 5 inch heels, lacy, frilly, petticoated doseedo dress with no white gown to look professional? This doctor should just stick with her beauty spa practice."
1412,Dr. Huong T. Le,Houston,Texas,Family Doctor / G.P., Female,5,2.3,2012-02-14T16:10:16Z,1.3,1,1,1,2,"Dr. Le is horrible. she does not have time for the patients. she is insulting and rude. I saw her for a physical as i was being escorted to the exam room she she came out of the room with bloody gloves while her patient was still on the exam table in a very akward position. The staff is rude and not at all accomodating. The wait is horrible, I waited 2 hours before I saw a doctor. On one visit she had her inexperienced, immature teen daughter checking patient's vital signs. she is not a clean person. her exam rooms are always filthy and while she is examining you she is always eating something. The last time i saw her instead of treating me for strep and flu she tried to get me to get a facial at her spa and wellness clinic. DO NOT SEE THIS DOCTOR. HORRIBLE"

I generally don't have an issue getting an appointment and my prescription refills. Staff is friendly but her assistant tends to be forgetful and if she promises to do something for you like fax prescriptions, I strongly recommend you check to see if it was done. She often forgets."

Each time I went w/ a concern, I was brushed off w/ general explanations of what the situations ""could be"" and what ""I might"" be able to do about it. No attempt was made to get a definitive answer in either situation. When I asked for a note to be allowed to have bottled water with me at work (due to a history of kidney stones and my employer being obscenely out of line) I was denied and told to drink water on breaks and before or after work. (I work 11 or 12 hour days w/ 1 hour break time) First, I shouldn't have to be told by anyone when I am allowed water and definitely not by my Dr. Secondly, it was a small request that would've made a huge difference. When I asked why she wouldn't write the note, I was told to see a urologist. Brushed off again. Now I have to find an entirely new specialist doctor and pay a new copay all because she couldn't be bothered to write a note for WATER."

I am still waiting on my refund. After results of blood test, doctor recommended over the counter vitamins/supplements, and office would not write a letter of necessity required for my medical benefit account in order for me to receive reimbursement. Doctor's office mentioned that I would have to pay $20.00 in order for doctor to write letter!!! I was asked to redo annual lab tests ordered by the doctor by hospital without doctor's office notifying me of results or reason why this re-test was required."

He prescribed cough suppressant, when that did not help, he told me to try the OTC stuff which I had told him at my visit I had already done and it wasn't effective and he told me to go see a different doctor. He did not tell me to go see a specialist or see a doctor that might be able to help me in a more specific way.

He made notes about things that were not even discussed at our encounter. Refused to examine me or address my pain. His notes are very self-serving and do not reflect reality. Prescribed meds for another condition. I reported that I was allergic to the meds. He wrote something else in the notes. No wonder the VA is in trouble - they hire doctors who do not practice medicine. Overall, my experience with VA is very good, but this doctor is a disaster waiting to happen, in my opinion."

We ended up having to call our own insurance company and they told us we were improperly billed and that they would re-submit and correct this. This tells me they are trying to maximize their billing ability and dont care when customers call to ask.

She dismissed all my concerns regarding my periods, skin etc. Last week I ended up having complete hysterectomy for stage IV endometriosis. If only she had listened to symptoms and not judged me , my endometriosis wouldnt have been so bad."

It was definatly worse than my last vist. Staff is actually friendly though. Doctor is not friendly and bedside manner is terrible. I wouldnt be suprised if schooled elsewhere as in out of d country elsewhere. I'm very disappointed with this doctor b/c she seem to take on a don't care attitude. I have visited this doctor more than 4 times but less than 7 I would say.

However, I saw her at the Strawberry Clinic which is a horrible experience no matter who the dr. is. Her nurses are very nice and helpfull, but the receptionist could care less. If your 15 minutes late you have to reschedule. Even though it could take up to 4 hrs. or more before you finally see her. Since I cannot afford any place else I have to deal with it. But, she IS a wonderful dr. and person."

My husband and I both saw her after having to change from a very good doctor. She had a ""Dr. knows best"" attitude that I could not believe. Also by talking to her, it was clear that she was completely clueless about one of my medical issues yet she still was determined to come up with her own uninformed treatment. She then tried to prescribe a medication to my husband that he was allergic too; luckily, the computer system kicked it back. Steer clear of this one if you can."

The message on the phone sends you to one loop and then puts you into another loop. 24 hours before they can return a call. 8 hours in a working day so does this mean they will can you back in 3 day. The rating giving them a five is a myth. If they were that good then everyone would have an experience of a 5. My rating of Elizabeth is a -0.01 and that just bad she is. We are in a phase of advanced technology and it take the a week to process paperwork. What are they using stone.

At first, she was a great doctor and I loved her. Over the years, she has been less polite and tells me that I am fine when I clearly do not feel well. Her staff is not very professional and treats my mother and I like we know nothing. I called today to ask for a copy of my shot records so that I can volunteer at a summer camp. The receptionist told me to wait while she looked. I waited for four minutes, that is until she hung up on me. I have also recently went in for a visit because I felt dizzy(vertigo) and my ear hurt. She took a look in my ears and concluded that I was fine and that what I was saying was wrong. She then proceeded to raise her voice at my mom telling her once again that I was fine. To anyone reading this, this may not seem like much, but her manner towards my mom was very disrespectful. This is not the first time it has happened, but this time it may be the last."

I called 3 days in a row before anyone called me back to discuss results. Today, I received a letter in the mail saying that I was discharged from the practice and would not be able to make another appointment so I should find another Dr asap. I called to ask why and the receptionist verified I had no balances, change in PCP or insurance that would put him out of my network. This Dr has given me a horrible experience and has wasted a great deal of my time. I would not recommend him to anyone. ***Update*** I went to get a copy of my lab results that I had paid for and they refused to give them to me! They said I needed to find a new Dr and that they would send them to the new one but that they did not have to share them with me.

Only one staff member gave a smile and a pleasant response. Time was great, for it having been a walk in. I beleive it to be unsanitary practice for a physician to not use a specula when handling an otoscope.

When I came into this doctor’s office, after taking Vital signs the Nurse put me in the room doctor made me wait 1 hour and she prescribed me antibiotics for cold and coughing, without even checking anything I asked the Doctor how much do I have to pay, I was told by the receptionist that because you don’t Insurance you would only cost $51.00 .I paid When she gave me bill I asked why that is showing Balance amount. She stated you don’t have to worry about that it’s nothing (computer calculate itself in your case your treatment cost for today is $51.00 only). I left the office, after paying for the appointment and my prescription. The doctor did not talk to me or help me understand what was wrong with me. Plus, it did not help me when I started taking the antibiotics. In fact, I felt worse as the days went on while on the prescription.
Not only did I pay $51 for the appointment, but $67.00 for the prescription. On top of that, I get a bill in the mail from the doctor’s office, stating I owe another $204.00 and They have lied to me. The entire staff is misleading their patients and charging them huge amounts.
When I went back to the office to sort this out, they ignored me. This doctor’s office was poorly run.
I went to another doctor to get a second opinion. He told me that I didn’t need those antibiotics.
I would never ever recommend anyone to go this UNPROFESSIONAL doctor’s clinic. I am thinking to file lawsuit against the doctor. If anybody has had the same problem or a similar situation with this clinic, please contact me.

He will NOT explain up front, what he expects from you, but if you don’t meet his expectations, he’ll dump you as a patient, and NOT explain why he did it! What he seems to expect from you is that you come running and crying to him every time you get the sniffles, or a hang-nail. If you are overweight, he’ll explain to you, for instance, that you should “exercise more and eat less”, and then you are supposed to say, “Gee, Doctor, that’s a GREAT idea, lemme try that. Here’s your $100!” And he’ll keep you on a way-short leash, for prescription renewals. You don’t like it? He’ll dump you in a New York minute!
The following details are changed to protect anonymity: The other type of thing Dr. Desai will do, is to refuse to prescribe routine simple meds for simple problems, if you aren’t exhibiting the problem at the time. Say you have otic megaboogaboogosis, generally, but don’t have it at the moment. He may prescribe you nothing. Come back when you have it again. If he’s booked for the next week, you may call in the next time you have it… And be scheduled to be seen a week later. Otic megaboogaboogosis is gone now? Then prepare for the possibility that you may have to pay yet again to come in yet again! Maybe try to find a way to prolong your otic megaboogaboogosis for longer next time! These are generally the stunts that he seems inclined towards pulling, to maximize his profits, at your expense. He wants you to trust him as your doctor, but he will NOT trust YOU when you say that you often have otic megaboogaboogosis! He has to see it to believe it, and I doubt that you’d have any better luck even if you pull your past medical records for him to see.
All this is likely to be legal, but it’s hardly ethical. He doesn’t treat others the way he’d like to be treated. I suggest that you find a doctor who is concerned more about you, and less about himself.

1514,Dr. Minesh Desai,Houston,Texas,Family Doctor / G.P., Male,2,2.38,2018-12-24T16:37:13.756Z,2.8,4,3,1,3,"Short version: Dr. Desai acts unethically, for his own benefit over that of his patients, in my opinion.
How would you feel as a restaurant customer who has eaten only part of his meal, has paid in full, but is then asked to leave the restaurant, without all the food having been provided yet? And no reason is given for why you’re being deprived of all that you’ve paid for? And there’s no reason provided at all, even after you ask?
That’s basically what Dr. Desai did to me. He took my money (plus that of my insurance company), and ran the usual blood tests. The normal expectation after such an exchange is that simple, routine prescriptions will be refilled for the next ½ year. However, Dr. Desai dumped me 2 months later, and refuses to give me a reason why. I now have to find and pay a new doctor for routine refills for the remaining months, approaching 4 months.
A simple ethical test of what one is doing is to ask “what would happen if everyone acted the way I am acting?” In this case, patients and insurance companies would to be paying a lot more, as patients constantly have to shop for a new doctor.
Other ethical aspects here are as follows: I am now “black-listed” with other doctors in the same group. Dr. Desai shared whatever “medical data” it was that upset him (did I have bad breath or BO? I don’t know) with other doctors in the group, obviously, at least to the extent that other doctors know that I am “persona non grata” there. I signed confidentiality v/s sharing agreements to share data for the purpose of OBTAINING medical care, not for the purpose of being DENIED medical care! And all the doctors there have plenty of openings, and I was in no way impolite to Desai. I suspect that I got dumped simply because I don’t bring in enough money for him, I don’t go running and crying to see him about every little thing… And I asked for 90-day prescriptions, which may also be an offense. Put it this way: I suspected this kind of thing already, and so I never told him that I take anti-cholesterol pills only once every 2 days, to reduce side effects. If I had done so, I think that he’d have cut my prescribed pills-quantities in half, to make me go see him more often. That’s the kind of skin-flint that he seems to be.
In summary, I suggest that you look for a doctor who is looking out for himself less, and looking out for you, more.

I made the appointment 5 days ahead and confirmed that I needed to come in for a vaccination which is supposed to be free on my insurance. As I get there, after taking an hour off work, they have me fill out all new patient forms, copy my license and insurance card and I sit there for 10 minutes. I get called up to the counter and get told it will be $150. I politely said it is supposed to be free as it is 100% covered under my insurance. Her response was ""You don't think you can get a shot without the doctor seeing you first do you?"" I said I just need a shot, here is a copy of my complete vaccination record. I also explained that there was no mention of this at all when I made the appointment, nor when they called me on Friday to confirm my appointment. With that I was told I couldn't have a shot without paying the doctor $150 to look at my vaccination record and say ""yes, you need your TDAP"" then leave in likely under a minute.
With that, I left the building and requested they destroy all the forms and copies that I had given to them. I will not be going back and will find myself a new primary care physician.
It's a shame, I have read good reviews of the doctor hence me choosing him; however, he is being let down by his employees not being upfront with patients. I will choose a new doctor and probably pay whatever it costs to see that doctor prior to my vaccinations, as long as they are upfront about it. Dr Tsuchida's staff were not hence this poor review. I cannot have any trust in a doctor if the first thing that happens is this."

Cons: his staff is less than pleasant. I had an appointment at 9am, waited until almost 11am just to fine out that the nurse/receptionist forgot about me. Had I not went to counter to ask her, she probably would not call me at all. The average wait is about 1 - 2 hours."

She didn't do the women exam neither understood the lab tests.

She was “doctor” in charge of family member at hospital. She did not see patient until 6th day in hospital post surgery.

Hospital staff seemed happy when I mentioned filing complaint on her. One nursing staff even said “you will be next in a long line”!!
She masauerades as a doctor but does not fulfill her due diligence requirements and puts patients & hospital at risk!"

Although his staff are a couple of lazy bimbos, he is the best doctor my family has ever met. Yes he might have straight forward signs on the wall, but would you want dirty people to leave stinky diapers where you work? And hello people he is not the only one that makes you pay before you go in, maybe he's had a bad experience with thieves, we don't know, and your going to pay any ways so who cares?The bottom line is instead of complaining of all the little crap around you, think about the reason you went,to get help.Like i said before, yes his staff is stupid! that's the only thing he should change."

Money over patient’s well being. In summary, the dispute was with copay & respect for patients. I left Dr. Nolaso’s office without ever speaking with Dr. Nolasco since they were going to charge me additional $30 to complain, can you believe that? Although I have insurance, most of the patients that see Dr. Nolasco are poor & uninsured and its evident that the medical staff have been trained that money will be the conveyor belt to see the doctor. As I sat in the waiting rooms, there were multiple signs that states their method of operations and one still vivid in memory “No Dirty Diapers, please take them with you” The sign is pretty straight forward but realize a medical clinic will operate based on the tolerance the patient allows"

Nurses do not return calls or even want to be bothered. The only way to see the doctor if to pay for visit so you can talk to him. And he has gotten so many complaints from other patients I don't even know how he can still be running his practice. He talks in about patients behind their backs. He has shared many personal info about other patients with me, and had gotten several people very sick by over medicating them with narcatics and had caused people to become addicts."

Last visit was horrible, I asked him to look at something else other than what I came for and he sighed then stated we are about to close even though I was on time for my appointment which was his last patient for the day. That day, I waited 30 minutes for him after the nurse took me in. Recently, I left him a voicemail on a Friday and called back the following Monday, Tuesday, and gave up Wednesday. He returned my voicemail 6 days later on a Thursday. He forgot my name, I gave him my name as I do every call I receive and he still asked for to speak to me. I pay a lot of money for health benefits and these Doctor visits. I make time to leave early from work to get “treated” like this. I will not be going back to see Dr. Michael P.

In the past decade, she has completely converted her focus to the commercial sham of a weightloss program that she pushes onto her patients. She dismisses the medical concerns of her day-to-day patients. I had a few minor medical issues come up over the past few years and her treatments were ineffective and her follow-up care was non-existent. She never suggested annual check-ups or tried to make sure that her treatments worked. She has sold out and all of her medical patients are paying the price!! Do not choose her. Save yourself the grief and the co-pay!!"

She always rushes you through your appointment. She doesn't allow you the time to explain what problems you're having. I stop going to her after the second visit.

Also, I had requested one year of a particular medication, because my insurance was about to run out, and rather than coming back in a month, I would get a year's worth of medication, and just continue to pay for the prescrip. in cash (not through insurance). They agreed to give me one year's worth of medication without hesitation (which made me very happy!), and then I went on my way to Walgreens to fill my 1st prescription. When I got to Walgreens, the pharmacist told me that they only gave my one MONTH's worth of the medicine I needed, so I asked the pharmacist to call Dr. Hill's office. They called and Dr. Hill's office insisted that I only will get one MONTH's worth of medicine, and if I need more, to come back after the insurance ran out. After that, I never went back, and have been extremely happy with my new doctor."
1572,Dr. Vincent Kao,Woodlands,Texas,Family Doctor / G.P., Male,1,2,2010-08-09T13:39:48Z,2,2,3,2,1,Doctor Kao is not a family care doctor I would recommend. He is very quick with his patients. In and out the door. He does not ask important questions and does not take into consideration the symptoms that you are having. He seems to not care at all. He is quick with giving strong prescriptions and does not even look into what you may have. He also gives large doses of said prescriptions which you may not even need in the first place. This doctor is not worth the 50 dollars he charges to see him. He does not seem to know what he is doing and does not seem to care about the patient's health and well-being. The staff is also unfriendly.

THE STAFF TRIES TO HELP KEEP THE PATIENTS CALM AND COMFORTABLE HE YELLS AND BELITTLES THEM WITH A RACIAL FLARE.

I've seen Janki herself ONLY once in all those times. Her staff is rude & unprofessional. I went in and had blood work for an insect bite. I was perscribed antibiotics & an inhaler for a tight lung. I went to pick up my meds, and was told by Walgreens that the Dr's office had to call the insurance to verify the inhaler. Walgreens informed me that they notified the Dr's office of this. I went to get my blood work results 3 days later, only to have to wait in the patient room for an hour. Why? Because the Dr. was in a meeting! Why would you schedule appts when you've scheduled a meeting!? When I got upset & asked for my results and wanted to leave, they asked if I wanted to pay for my future appt. to come back and discuss the results with the Dr. in advance. UM NO! Why would I want to pay for a 'future' service?! Its been a week and I STILL dont have my inhaler! Had to call them again! DONT GO TO THIS DR!!!!I'd rate them a ZERO if I could!!!"

I called to get a prescription re-filled and Dr. Janki kept calling me darling instead of using my name. On an earlier visit I told her that I was allergic to ibuprofen and she told me to take Advil 3 times which clearly contains ibuprofen. Apparently she practices guessing. Very rude person as I am a paying customer. I will never use this so called Dr. again. On one visit my foot was injured and they did and X-ray and sent me to a store to buy crutches while I was crippled and driving myself. The excuse was they ran out and the office was closing. Janki is rude and uncaring and very unprofessional. I took my daughter in because I thought she had a stye on her eye, Janki examined her and was very rough when she touched her eyelid and it made me and my child uncomfortable.

She prescribes meds with no knowledge their availability and will leave you stuck waiting 24 hrs when ill, to return the pharmacy's call.

Too bad his front office staff rates a solid F. During my first (and only) visit his office staff double charged me for my office co-pay. After I left, his office claims they made additional credit adjustment which resulted in me owing them over $60! I checked my bank debit card stmts & could find no evidence of any such adjustments. On an aborted 2nd visit his staff demanded I pay them $60+ BEFORE I could see the doctor. They mever provided me w/ a statement & told me, in spite of having a 2 PM appointment, both the doctor & business office mgr were out of the office at 2 PM. I refused to wait and left w/out seeing Sawar. I called my insurance & promptly replaced Sawar with another primary care MD. Nice doctor but totally incompetent front office staff. Avoid his practice like the plague. "

The last one he tried to treat with medication caused me to fall and injure myself. Neither he or the Hospital District he works for are willing to take any responsibility for the cost of subsequent treatment. Additionally, he had removed from my chart a few medical issues that needed to be taken care of. This has caused me multiple problems in getting the proper medical services I need.

The office is dirty and unprofessional, and he couldn't even be bothered to look me in the eye. I went in to renew prescriptions after being released from my previous doctor...his only concern was getting me OFF medications for 2 chronic illnesses and he would only renew ONE MONTH of refills (this was only after I expressed concern - he wasn't going to renew anything). He didn't even test my levels for one of them. Does it take a genius to see that those illnesses are controlled by medication and in normal ranges BECAUSE of the medication. Don't waste your time. He is arrogant and has no interest in actually seeing you as a patient. Now I have to find the time (and a babysitter...AGAIN) to go to another doctor!! The only positive thing I can say is that the nurse was awesome!"

Dr. Castillo is a very kind, calm doctor but his staff is highly incompetent.I needed lab work and a person that was on the front desk came over to do the blood work on me. She was obviously very nervous and even told me that she did not do this a lot and only would ""fill in"" for the full time phlebotomist. I was floored. I left and told them I would come back when the lab staff was available. I came back in the next day with the same girl there to do it. I was told that the lab person was at another location and to come back next week. I went back the next week and didn't receive my results until 3 whole weeks later.Also, they seem to be confused about sending a fax or doing a referral and submitting an rx request. I gave the feedback to Dr. Castillo that this was unacceptable and my health was too important to me to be playing around like this. A decent doctor but His support staff SUCKS!!"

He had my husband on 80mg of Prednisone a day in a poor attempt to control his Crohn's disease (which Dsouza said he knew little about). By the time we realized what was happening, my husband had gained over 60 pounds and was nearly dead from an intestinal blockage. He went to the ER for the blockage, ended up having his intestine split open and had half of his large intestine removed. He survived that (barely - a week in SICU), then had his gallbladder go gangrenous (they suspect it was the large amount of Prednisone that Dsouza had him on). Stay away from this man if you have anything more serious than a cold."

After suffering a near fatal stroke due to a physical trauma, my family did much research to insure my father received the highest care possible. We also had to proceed with a lawsuit against his job since his stroke was a work related injury. He continues to need regular checkups to insure he is healthy and progressing. My father had the decency to inform Dr. Sandoval of his case to which she immediately dropped my father from her care. We have not asked for Dr. Sandoval's direct or indirect involvement with his ongoing case. She is not a stroke specialist therefore her expertise is not sought in this matter. We just wanted him to continue with his primary doctor since she has been prior to his stroke. Do ethics play a role when refusing care because of a lawsuit?"

I saw a PA who didn't do a thorough exam. I went due to dizziness and nausea. My blood pressure was high and she said she would retake it in a few minutes but she never did. She offered no possible diagnosis and I was given lab orders and sent on my way. When I called for my results I was told they were normal but that I needed to eat a low-calorie diet. So I guess my weight caused my dizziness. Seriously?! My weight was never discussed beyond hormonal changes due to menopause. I won't go back.

He then stated that I would have to fill out the proper papers for the Rennaisance Group, who he is affiliated with - and would not give me the person's name or address or telephone number for me to contact them. He is useless. USAA insurance company was ready to pay a settlement but I could not get an estimate of how much it would cost to have x-rays and medication done on my back and leg, so I had to go to another doctor to have it done.

Not only was she aloof and cold<. she didnt listen to me. Instead she misdiagnosed me; she told her nurse to call me and tell me she had sceduled me for surgery immediately without my consent; she refused to speak to me after my visit; she referred me to a surgeon with a history of malpractice; she lied to me regarding my ultrasound tests. Becasue of her my diasnosis was delayed. if yu have a common, non-life threatening problem- zakia is ther doctor for you. However, dont trust her with your life or the lives of your loved ones. i dont know how she became a doctor."

I like to be informed on the diagnosis, treatment, options but during both visits the more questions I was asking the more irritated the doctor seemed to be. At the end he raised his voice telling me something like he is the doctor here and I should follow what he says. I didn't like to be treated in this way. Also his staff is not reliable at all. I was promised to be called back with some important information and it never happened. I'm going to change this doctor since thankfully there are offices that care more about the patients."

My husband and I saw her and she misdiagnosed him. He was later diagnosed by another Dr with a critical illness. She isn't very knowledgeable and didn't want to hear our concerns.

She is the owner of this clinic. I walked in the examining room and caught her screaming at my daughter and standing in front of her in a very aggressive way. My daughter was in tears and she is 21 weeks pregnant and has a high risk pregnancy. I asked immediately what was going on and Ms. Mitchell said she needs to step outside to come down. My daughter was only asking for referrals to a Dermatologist regarding some moles that need to be biopsied. The nurse practitioner said she doesn't need a referred for that and that she removes them all the time. The nurse got angry and offended when my daughter said she preferred a dermatologist take care of it sense it needs to be tested for cancer. I have never seen anything like it. She obviously has anger issues and big ego issues.AND SHE IS NOT A DOCTOR EVEN THOUGH SHE IS LISTED AS 1"
