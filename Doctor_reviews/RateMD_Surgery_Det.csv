1,Dr. Mazen S. Harake,Detroit,Michigan, General Surgeons , Male,5,4.30,2019-04-14T16:38:20.297Z,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Very dedicated plastic surgeon, detail oriented awesome breast lift results "
2,Dr. Mazen S. Harake,Detroit,Michigan, General Surgeons , Male,5,4.30,2017-04-13T18:59:18.491Z,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Recently, my primary care physician referred me to Dr. Mazen Harake's office for reconstructive breast surgery. From my first conversation with Angela, the patient coordinator/office manager and undeniable Renaissance woman, to the present, I have been given a level of care and compassion typical of that extended to a family member. Dr. Harake and Angela are the yin and yang of this practice, working in perfect harmony to ensure that the trust a patient like myself (a senior citizen quite reluctant to rush to the OR) places in them is well-deserved whether it be at the initial consultation, pre- or post-operatively. Not only is Dr. Harake a consummate professional, but he is also an extraordinary and gifted surgeon who fully capitalizes on his training in general surgery, plastic surgery, and aesthetic surgery. Additionally, Dr. Harake utilizes 3-D technology that fully enabled me to visualize my post-surgical results. While I am still in the healing stages, I unquestionably know that Dr. Harake has helped me achieve my aesthetic goals, but, more importantly, he has restored a level of health that I haven't had for over thirty years."

Georgeson,Clinton Township,Michigan, General Surgeons , Male,17,4.66,2016-08-15T14:30:41.953Z,1.0,1,1,1,1,"Allowing Dr.Georgeson to preform my breast augmentation was the WORST decision of my LIFE. He left me with a severe case of symmastia and complete denial that it was his fault. This is one of the most rare and complicated problems to have with a breast augmentation and is nearly impossible to repair. I have been quoted from several professional well known surgeons around $10,000-$14,000 for the revision surgery. If I could convince everyone on here not to have surgery done by him I would. I'm only 21 years old and my life will be altered forever due to his lack of experience. PLEASE SAVE YOUR TIME,PAIN, and MONEY and go to someone else."
7,Dr. Andrew M. Georgeson,Clinton Township,Michigan, General Surgeons , Male,17,4.66,2015-02-26T19:37:18.000Z,5.0,5,5,5,5,"What an amazing experience this is! I have been suffering from restless leg for years, to the point that I was having a hard time sleeping. After seeing a commercial about Allure I called for a free consultation. It turned out I have vein issues that are hereditary and a result of standing for 10-14 a day. My insurance covered the procedure so I did it. My legs do not keep me up at night any more spazzing and tensing and I didn’t have to take a medication for it. My legs feel “lighter” and just more comfortable. It’s a good idea for anyone with such issues young or older, in my opinion. I want to personally thank Dr. G, Inna, Michelle, Ashley, Ashley again :-}, Megan, Angie and Erica at the Livonia office. All of you have gone above and beyond to make this, not just a good experience but a fun experience. I feel like family there. Thank you all so much! Dawn"
8,Dr. Andrew M. Georgeson,Clinton Township,Michigan, General Surgeons , Male,17,4.66,2010-09-23T09:58:47Z,5.0,5,5,5,5,Dr. Georgeson is by far the best physician I have ever been to. He is approachable and extrememly knowledgeable. He spent all the time I needed with him and he took care of my spider veins. I have never been able to recommend a physician as highly as him
9,Dr. Andrew M. Georgeson,Clinton Township,Michigan, General Surgeons , Male,17,4.66,2010-01-11T12:49:11Z,4.5,4,4,5,5,"Everything was going along great when I called to change an appointment in Dec.2009 I was told that Dr. Georgeson would not be doing vein work anymore. They asked me if he had not told me that when I had my last appointment, I said he seemed to be teaching a new doctor to do the procedure and said he was going to be a partner.I felt absolutely dupped, how can you start someone's leg veins knowing that you can't finish them. I was very disappointed in the way I was treated and the lack of information shared."

Georgeson,Clinton Township,Michigan, General Surgeons , Male,17,4.66,2009-02-05T18:18:43Z,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Georgeson and his staff were very professional and always friendly and courteous. Many times as I arrived for my appointment, I would find them waiting for me at the door. I had already tried another procedure on my legs to fix my vericose veins (injections) and unfortunately, it did not work for me. So, I turned to Dr. Georgeson and could not be more pleased with the procedure and the service I received. The pain was minimal and made the surgery well worth it for me. I am very appreciative of Dr. Georgeson and his staff for the help they gave me. They made me feel at ease and comfortable before, during and after the procedure."
13,Dr. Andrew M. Georgeson,Clinton Township,Michigan, General Surgeons , Male,17,4.66,2008-10-23T08:49:19Z,5.0,5,5,5,5,Am very pleased with the results of my surgery. Went to one of Dr Georgeson's seminars where everything I needed to know was explained throughly. The new Trivex proeedure was great! It didn't leave any scarring thanks to Dr. Gorgeson.

He spent as much time as you required with you without making you feel like you need to rush through your sympthoms so he could move on to the next patient.

Doesn't follow-up with patients, paperwork or tries to pretend it isn't their fault when things go wrong. Horrible bedside manner, doesn't back up his word or promises. Relies on residents too heavily and no control over office staff. Out of touch with real people with real problems. Would never recommend him as a surgeon."

I am thankful everyday of my life that he was there the day we were sent to childrens. He cared about every feeling we had. He told me it was life threating and was not a simple operation. Blood vessels were intertwined and that she may not make it-- decision had to be made right away. He then rushed off to research her condidtion. I waited for 3.5 hours while they removed an enormous mecenteric cyst / lymphangioma from my 22 month old baby girl. After the surgery I cried and cried. He came out and told me they had to remove 20% of her colon and her appendix. He started to walk away and turned around came back and gave me a hug! I love Dr. cullen he is a brilliant surgeon and a good man. The scar on my daughters belly is amazing perfectly straight tiny scar.

After mostly ignoring my pleas and I was forced to go to medical affairs to ask him finally, he attacked me with strange contrived accusations in his office visit summaries. Be warned: Dr. Cullen uses his office visit summary that goes way beyond the professional surface. This has all been documented with Children's Hospital of Michigan's medical affairs."

His concern is how to help you on your way to a better life. My wife and I have both had him as a surgen and would recomend him to anyone having gastric bypass. He is patient, realistic, both of you know why you are in his office so no point in being shy about it. He talks to you like a person and not just a number, tries to keep it to lay talk not a lot of dr. talk. He will take as long with you as you need. He answers your questions and you can ask until you understand what he has told you. I do not think I could ever have found someone else who is as good as he is. We are from Canada, they work well with OHIP. The staff is amazing. I could not have had a better experience. Thank You Dr. Carlin"

He did emergency surgery on me to remove my gallbladder. He was done with his shift when I came in, but agreed to look at me since it was very snowy out and there were no other surgeons and he was still there. He looked at my test results then examined me and after touching my abdominal area I was in so much pain I wanted to punch him and he said ""sweetheart, you need surgery more sooner than later later is now good for you too?"" He was afraid he would need to open me for it due to an incision he thought might get in the way for another surgery I had but he was able to do it laparoscopic. I was in some pain after surgery but compared to having gallstones and pancreatitis, I felt 100% better. He had a great bedside manner and personality. He's also very nice to have to look at."

I truly believe he saved my life. He has treated me for many conditions since that time, despite the fact that I moved to Albuquerque and have to fly to Michigan to be seen by him. His bedside manner is kind and caring, and I am never nervous before procedures because I know I am in the best hands possible. I have referred other patients to him who have had the same experiences with him as I have. If you need a highly qualified and kind thoracic surgeon, please do yourself a favor and call Dr. Camero."

I find him to be very pleasant and very knowledgeable. He is easy to talk to and listens to you when you are talking. He spent a great deal of time with me trying to understand what was bothering me and equal amount of time doing his neurological examination. I am thankful that I have him as my doctor.
70,Dr. Fadi H. Delly,Detroit,Michigan, General Surgeons , Male,2,3.50,2014-07-10T20:29:48Z,2.0,5,1,1,1,"I recently was referred to see Dr. Fadi for an EMG. Let me say, I was not impressed with him at all or his bedside manners were nonexistent. Secondly, he's not even board certified in neurology yet, since he just graduated from his neurology residency. There are plenty of good neurologist out there, that are board certified and have years of experience. The only positive note of my experience at his office, and that his office staff was very friendly. Always research your physicians credentials before choosing."

72,Dr. David Gorski,Detroit,Michigan, General Surgeons , Male,7,2.36,2015-12-03T17:26:35.517Z,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Considering the negative reviews based on his internet activities by people who dislike his outspokenness, I feel the need to offset those reviews until actual patient reviews are given. "
73,Dr. David Gorski,Detroit,Michigan, General Surgeons , Male,7,2.36,2015-06-03T06:11:02.814Z,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Well, no one on here seems to actually have been to Dr gorski and neither have I! But I suppose my review is no less valid than theirs, since internet experiences seem to be the only thing counting so far. On that note, the work Dr gorski does trying to expose medical fraud and advocating for science in medicine is invaluable, and if Dr gorski ever reads this I hope he knows he has someone in his corner, for whatever that's worth.

She needs to come off her high horse and do more listening and less talking. She took on the responsibility of caring for my brother but actually contributed to his death. We would tell her about my brothers concerns and she would just dismiss them without looking into it. example, lymph nodes were swollen in his groin and she dismissed it as a hernia. Had she suggested diagnostic testing, he may be alive today. I will never forgive her or Dr. Lucas for neglecting my baby brother. During his hosp stay, we would patiently wait for these two drs to visit my brother and they would rush in and out. Didnt have the decency to answer our questions, they were more concerned about there students. I hate them for neglecting my poor brother. He was finally diagnosis with stage 4 colon cancer and died 10 later. My family and I hope they suffer as my baby brother did"
