Dr Mason his bed side manner is the best he makes you feel comfortable his knowledge is second to none. I was pregnant with my 5th child at 40 years old I was turned away by 3 OB's and was told by 1 that if I was his wife he would advise to abort.
Dr Mason sat with my husband and I and said all is good see you in a month. You cannot put a price on having trust and confidence in your Doctor. I delivered by c-section a heathy baby boy and the c-section was with out any complications. Dr Mason you are Respected and truly loved by my family.

I have seen him with other patients and myself and would never choose anyone over him. He is such a good and caring person and I have to agree, treats you like family. Not only does he have a good bed-side manner, he has more experience and knowledge than most physicians and is able to maintain calm through any stressful situation. He saved me from having a premature baby at 23 wks...and I was able to make it to 35 wks...only because of him. I have never met an OB Dr like him and don't think ever will unfortunately, since I have now moved to California."

No one guesses that I am 50 because I started on my anti aging kick early. I trust Dr. Lichten and feel that my health is better and I look better than 90% of women my age due to the treatments and recommendations of Dr Lichten. He is very brilliant and goes off his gut instinct and works with you and your own personal issues. I feel some of the comments above are likely due to the newer nature of natural hormones and also Dr.Lichten suffered the loss of his wife in the past 2 years. I highly recommend him to all my friends.

I replied yes and asked if she had an appointment. The woman then aggressively states she had an interview at 8:30am and she had been waiting for over 45mins. I simply stated she must have made a mistake as our location doesn't open until 9am (This information is also located on the front of our door). She then loudly yells she is never wrong and even our web site indicates we open at 8:30. My reply was simply that she clearly made a simply mistake; as for our web site there is a disclaimer that our times and fees are subject to change sometimes without notice. I ask her name and she replies I'M a doctor! I DON'T make mistakes. It was at this point I stated was no longer interested in conducting an interview as base on her aggressive behavior not to mention I was not even in the building yet. I simply wished her the best in endeavors to find a medical position elsewhere. This person then shouted BYE!. I then opened the front door to the building and to my surprise she was behind me still yelling. I asked her several times to leave the office only to have her question my position, my authority and insisted she be interviewed. Again, I refused to conduct this interview and stated it was for a Medical Assistant not for a physician. She then stated she would be reporting me for being unprofessional. She stormed out of the office spouting profanities. Once my internet was running I checked her resume which indicates she has a LIMITED medical license & she is currently unemployed. There are no references listed on her resume nor any disclaimer indicating they would be furnished upon request. The actual time of her interview was at 2:30pm on 12/18 as stated in my notations dated 12/12/2018. This facility prides itself on hiring compassionate, caring and understanding staff. Our patients are our main concern and we would never jeopardize our integrity or standards by considering someone that does not meet these qualifications."

Apparently she called multiple facilities and she got confused between them. We don’t open our facilities until 9 am and definitely not given the appointment to see the administrator at 8:30. Those circumstances and the fact that she was very aggressive and inconsistent just indicates that she is not telling the truth and got confused with multiple appointments that she made at different clinics. We are a private doctors office licensed by the state of michigan and have 5 stars on google. Its inadequate for us to hire a MD to work as a medical assistant especially. Dr Kalo talked to the specific individual and talked to Pam and concluded the truth and the true aggressive behavior of the above individual.

The Western Women's Center really cares about every single person that comes in. They are friendly, funny and when I needed to just talk- She/they listened. The people outside far away from the door haven't a clue what they are talking about! Shame on them for trying to use scare tactics. Don't believe them! Thank again, Pam and staff. ""you"" really helped me through the most difficult time in my life to date and for this I am/will always be eternally grateful."

I choose Women's Center because the lady answering the phone was extremly compassionate. Once in the office the counselor really spent quality time with my daughter. After a long talk we decided the heavy sedation was the way to go. It did cost a little more but was very much worth it to make sure my daughter was less nervous and comfortable during her visit. The medical staff was friendly and took the time to make sure we understood everything. The nurse in the recovery room brought me back aftee the surgery, she was knowldegable and very sympathetic to our situation. We then once again discussed birth conteol options that would fit my daughters needa. This clinic sincerely cares abouy its patients. I could noy be anymore pleased with our desicion to chooae Womens Center and Dr. Kalo, i would highly recommend this office."

I researched all the abortion clinics in the area and I'm so glad I came to this clinic. The staff was so nice and professional. The receptionist really took the time to listen to me and never once made me feel ashamed or embarrassed. The Dr. was very informative and made sure I fully understood what was going to happen before, during and after the procedure. I paid extra for the twilight sedation and it was worth every penny! I hardly felt a thing and was sooo relaxed. I want to recovery and the Registered Nurse took very good care of me & was very friendly ( She even gave me a choice of cookies and juice!) My husband came with me and he said the dr came out and talked to him. The Dr. made sure my husband understood what care I needed when I got home. I don't normally write reviews but when the office called to check on me a few days later to see how I was and again, took the time to really talk to me I felt it was my duty to inform all the women (young ladies) that might be going through the same thing to go to the Woman's centers you will be treated with respect and dignity. RECOMMEND THIS CLINIC 110%."

We always have been very satisfied with the professional and cordial treatment from the staff. We know this practice takes care of 100s of patients..we inquired about these ""bad reviews"" and according to the Medical Director those patients had demanding and aggressive behaviors. Which makes sense considering I've seen a few in his office with my own two eyes. Our doctor is BOARD CERTIFIED, not to mention staff there are very knowledgeable and answer ALL of your questions, not just some. Did I mention he's licensed by the state? Do your research people, you would be surprised how many doctors arent. These bad reviews are insane and I give nothing but a 5 star in my eyes."

I was seen right on time and was called immediately when my test results were in. Dr. Wu gave advice and NOT orders on what I could do to improve my health.

His bedside manner was very rude. His jokes were inappropriate! One example of one of his bad jokes was during my breast exam him asking me to lean forward and shimmy 🤔 thank God my boyfriend was not there he would of been pissed! I've been having a rough pregnancy and I've told him this and he has no compassion at all! Just all jokes. One day I went in with so much pain and all I hear as I'm laying down is him out in the area with the nurses talking so loudly and so obnoxiously I wanted to scream! At one point I started to just leave! His personality is just too over the top for me. He never seemed to be genuinely concerned for my pain. My mother didn't like him. Nor did my father or boyfriend
I would not recommended him to my friend's and family that's for sure. "

First of all, he was the doctor on-call, so no relationship had been built prior to labor and delivery. There was no immediate congratulations after my daughter had the baby. He told my daughter to stop talking and just push, and that she talks too much. Wow! she was telling me (her mother), that his assistant nail was hurting her while she was trying to deliver the baby. My daughter and the baby's father talk about it afterwards. We didn't say anything at the moment because we didn't want anything to go wrong with the delivery. You can't go around mistreating people and think its okay. Second of all, doctors should always introduce the on-call doctors ahead of time so moms to be can feel more at ease. Don't take that choice away from them and think that any doctor will do. "

He wanted to schedule my son's girlfriend for a D&C because he said that he didn't THINK the baby was growing. She opted to see another doctor for a second opinion and heard a healthy heartbeat. To want to schedule a D&C without another ultrasound or any other testing is absurd. Would not recommend him to anyone.

Dr.Stevenson really tries to put the patient at ease and explain things thoroughly. He has never let me leave without making sure any and all my questions are answered.

My waiting room wait was often an hour to an hour and a half(and i'm not exaggerating). They did run a few tests that I didn't need and they didn't follow the things I told them that needed to be done per my insurance. So I got charged for everything because all the useless tests were sent to the wrong facilities. I'm sure he knows what he is doing, but his bedside manner is rude. When he first introduced himself to my husband and I(then fiance)...I said hi i am ..... and this is my fiance ..... His response was, let me see the ring. No ring, means no engagement...It was just all downhill from there. :("

It made me feel very calm and relaxed myself. She took me as a patient during the last 6 weeks I was pregnant and I felt way more comfortable with her as my doctor then I did with my long time OBGYN.

Dr. Vista made me feel safe, to the point of doing the bare minimum of invasive procedures or examinations until I felt comfortable. Even my anxiety riddled daughter trusts Dr. Vista so much now she goes to her appointments alone.
After every examination you meet her back in her office where she asks about your life, answers your questions and addresses your concerns. I genuinely feel like she cares about me. She sees me once a year, yet she remembers details that I told her the year before.
I will NEVER see another doctor besides her ever again."

You'll get minimal attention or not attention from her at all. She doesn't share any information and she keeps it very short. She won't even ask you if you have questions or not. I did not feel any connection with her.
My prenatal visits were less than 2 minutes - she came to the room, measured my belly and heard the heartbeat. She walks away without asking me if I were to have any questions or not in the end.
P.S. Even though I read these reviews but I kept myself optimistic. Now I regret it for ignoring these negative comments.
DO YOU REALLY WANT AN OB/GYN LIKE HER FOR ALL OF YOUR PRENATAL VISITS FOR NEXT 9 MONTHS? (THINK TWICE) Her front desk people were unprofessional, gossiping in the office and laziness. "

I saw her 30 minutes before my surgery, and just did not feel as if I could trust her. She had a rather abrasive bedside manner, and did not clearly answer my questions. She refused to see me before I was discharged, and it was like pulling teeth to get her to call me back when I had some questions about my surgery. Her office finally got in touch with me--she never spoke to me, she had a nurse read me a message she'd left--and when I told her office that I would not be seeing her again in the future, I was basically hung up on.

I was happy also that she did extra tests to make sure I wouldn't have another problem I had previously, while assuring me that it would be normal to have that fear. thats what got me thru it was repeating what she said- it will be ok. My only problem stemmed from something she couldn't help and may not have known about- which was communication from the on call nurses. This is beyond her control though. I also was grateful she stayed after hours, thru a severe storm, researching a question I had and called me immediately with an answer. I was so impressed she was working at 7pm.

I was referred to him for a 2nd opinion by my ob/gyn. I truly appreciated his bedside manner and the fact that he never was in a rush to go to his next patient. I didn't mind the waiting because I knew he was going to be giving me his undivided attention as well. I am forever grateful to him for the outcome I received by him. He gave me hope when I thought their wasn't any. He is easy to talk to about anything which only helps put the patient at ease.

(After 7 years of ttc with specialists of all kinds, finding a doctor who listened to me, and what I was going through was refreshing and validating.) When my MRI showed that my condition was more serious than first believed, he called me personally and had another 45 minute conversation with me. When I thanked him, he told me that we were a team, and that I had to be 100% onboard before he took me into the operating room. He didn't take the easy way out with surgery options for me, and did everything he could to help me get my quality of life back, while maintaining my fertility. He was thorough with every explanation, and made sure to show me pictures with the explanations. He never rushed me during our appointments, never made me feel like I couldn't ask questions, and I asked A LOT. He was wonderful with my family after surgery, making sure that they also understood everything that was going on and what he had done during the surgery. My recovery has been great and I look forward to having my quality of life back! You owe it to yourself to meet with him before agreeing to any gynecological surgery!

He doesn't have the time to look at ALL of the facts regarding an appropriate diagnosis, nor does he care to listen to or even minutely empathize with the legitimate, excruciating pain I've been experiencing for many, many months. He was quick to have my symptoms completely minimized and actual test results either overlooked or disregarded. This is someone who thinks much more highly of himself and his time than any patient's and it was a huge let down to experience. If I'd known, I wouldn't have waited months waiting to meet with him and would have gone elsewhere and hopefully met a Dr who truly had my best interest, and proper treatment/diagnosis in mind. If you have a condition that is more grey versus black and white, go elsewhere. It's not worth your time, or even worse - smashed hope - to get proper care. Also, if he DOESN'T figure out what's wrong with you, Phase 2 of his process (which occurs if he can't diagnose you) actually has you living undiagnosed or treated and just living in pain daily, but still under his apparent care. That in itself was so incredibly sad to hear. Obviously, ego is more precious than actually putting a patient's health first."

When I met him, it did seem at first like this was the case: he was personable and attentive, (though I had a sneaking suspicion his non-diagnosis of my pelvic pain as ""neurological"" was just complete BS, a way to cover up his inability to find the source of my discomfort). Regardless, my follow-up experience with him has been horrendous. I have been trying for over two weeks to get an increased dosage on the medication I am already taking, which is what Dr. Eisenstein told me to do, and also get recommendations for a therapist to provide CBT, again in keeping with Dr. Eisenstein's own treatment plan. His secretary does not call me back, period. I got a nurse to contact the doctor about my medication, but after more days of waiting, Dr. Eisenstein said I would have to come back into the office to see him, just so he'd write me a script. I refuse to travel all the way to his office and pay for an appointment, (my insurance does not cover the treatment as I'm out-of-state) just so he can give the nurse permission to call my pharmacy. That's a real expensive phone call. Instead, I called my former doctor and, without even mentioning an appointment, she agreed to change my dosage, even though she hasn't seen me in months. Thanks for absolutely nothing, Dr. Eisenstein."

However, after that he did ABSOLUTELY NO follow through on anything he said. He didn't call in my prescriptions, didn't contact my physical therapist, and didn't submit the paperwork for my procedure that he said he would. He then tried to lie to me and said he had done all those things. I called him out on it as I was crying on the phone and he said ""look I'm very busy"". I tried to go forward with the procedure because of the time I had invested. He again was hard to get a hold of ( I waited on hold for 46 minutes), and didn't want to talk with me. Whenever I did get him on the phone, he couldn't even remember my info. My procedure (Botox) was cancelled due to the insurance companies stating it was an experimental procedure.

When my baby was born, Dr MAson checked on her whenever he was in the hospital in the NICU for her entire 33 day stay. He would ask how she and my husband and I were doing and would even ask the neonatal doctors questions to clarify things for us!!! I would recommend Dr Mason as a high quality doctor and human being!"

He does warn you in the worst case scenario but does not mean to scare you. I had a great working relationship with him because he is also VERY proactive. I cannot say enough good things about him! The punctuality factor is not all on him because of what he has to deal with so I think that is a moot point but his staff does what they can to keep things moving. His bedside manner is great and he is a warm individual. It was May 21,2001 that I gave birth to twins and every time I look at my kids, I have him to thank for it. I did have complications in the latter stages but he never balked at any time. When he retires, the ob/gyn world will lose a wonderful talent."

I've waited there before for over a hour and I was the only one there. She is rude and not caring at all. I'm surprised I stuck with her til I was 37 weeks pregnant.

She did not return my calls concerning questions I had about my care. I listened to her argue on the phone with the bldg. management, and she seemed to have no qualms about doing this in front of a patient. She has twice dismissed out of hand medical opinions that I have raised with her that I obtained from reliable sources. She was just plain wrong, and was unable to discuss or listen. I have found another doctor who is highly recommended and listens and converses in an itelligent and caring way.

The staff and our tech had been curteous and helpful, but she was rude without any reason as soon as she entered. She, very sarcastically and while rolling her eyes, told me my husband and 1.5 year old son should leave the room, because my son's whining was ""distracting"" to her. And since we didn't comply, she spent a total of 15 seconds looking at my baby's ultrasound before telling me that it looked fine. Not a very thorough exam for a high-risk OB speciallist. I sincerely hope this child is fine for her sake, otherwise I will make a complaint if something was not detected that could have been.

She is argumentative and appears to be almost spiteful in her recommendations to nurses and staff about patient orders. She treated us like complete idiots even though her colleagues had expressed differing opinions from hers. I wish I could convey just how bad I feel this doctor is...

It is not often that you find a doctor who seems to be genuinely concerned about his or her patient.After every exam he would take you to his office and explain to you his finding and what he suggests the manner of dealing with it. Dr. pickens had a way of making you feel at ease and his staff was also very helpful in this process also.

Stay away from this doctor, he is clueless, careless, in desperate need of a standard first aid course. How desperate is the healthcare system to hire a sorry excuse of a doctor like this guy . if you are stuck with him get a midwife, they are way, way more competent than he is. I'll go as far as saying a janitor is to be trusted more than Babik. STAY AWAY FROM HIM!!!! BETTER YET TAKE AWAY HIS LICENSE TO PRACTICE!!!!

He never told me anything that was going on with my pregnacy and was not the friendliest. Wish i could've had a better experience for my first...

235,Dr. Pamela Reaves,Detroit,Michigan, Gynecologists (OBGYN) , Female,1,1,2013-07-17T16:45:15Z,1,1,1,1,1,"This has been my worst experience with a doctor's office to date. I have attempted twice to see Dr. Reaves to obtain birth control. On the first attempt, I waited over an hour and still had not been seen. I had to leave. Now, I have made a second attempt and not only did I wait an hour without being seen but her medical assistant is VERY rude. I called about a week previous to the appointment so say that I wanted an IUD. I was told my appointment would be a week out so that they can order the IUD. When I get to the office the rude medical assistant first tries to charge me $40 my only $20 copay but also states that they still have yet to order my IUD. Apparently the doctor had to see me first which would have been fine if I would have been notified. I had to leave work early to get absolutely nothing accomplished for the SECOND time. Having to deal with the eye rolling and attitude of her medical assistant did not help either. I will never attempt to see Dr. Reaves again."

I would not recommend anyone to her. Not all but some of the staff that work at Detroit Community Health Connection are unprofessional."
