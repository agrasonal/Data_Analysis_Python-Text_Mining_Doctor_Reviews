The amount of paperwork required as a new patient was minimal. The paperless process was very user friendly and intuitive. The reception on the day of my appointment was very warming and welcoming. Alicia Welcome was simultaneously personable and professional. PA Forrest Griffin was very easy to talk to, thorough, and knowledgeable concerning my health issues and/or concerns. I was pleasantly surprised that at the end of my appointment Dr. Gurley himself actually came in and reviewed my record that had been created with PA Griffin. My experience at Dr. Gurley's office was by far my best to date, the epitome of punctual and professional."

I have other health issues and he is like the quarterback of my medical team. He monitors everything, he takes the time to really interact and I trust him in every respect. Truly like a personal physician from the past. No rushing.been though my job and home moved miles away from his area, I still remain with him because of his professionalism and loyalty to me.

He listens, gives straight-talk responses and is whip-smart. He remembers things from my last visit and truly has my best interests in-mind.

He is always punctual and very detailed in his analysis of you overall physicality. He has been my Doctor since 1997 and when I have an illness he is always available to treat me. His professionalism is superb and his staff is as professional and caring as himself. When your ill he takes time to listen to what you are saying and treats accordingly while interjecting his knowledge base. He calls you on the phone with any results or recommendations. He is awesome and we need more Doctors like him in this world. He will always be my choice for medical needs as long as I'm living in Atlanta. Great Doctor and great medical staff team.

A elderly friend referred him to my mother and I years ago, when I got married my husband became a patient and as soon as our twin daughters became teenagers he became their doctor as well. Him and his staff have always provided superior service. Everyone is always kind, respectful of your situation and your time, helpful, punctual, always available and knowledgeable of your health and needs. We have never been denied attention or treatment whether we had insurance or self paid. The doctors that Diaz refers you to provide excellent care(but still can't compare to his care)which you still get because he always stays involved in your treatment. I had two surgeries over the years and he visited me in recovery both times. Totally unexpected the first time. Phone consults which he barely charges for and only expects to see you in person if absolutely necessary. Cares about you not your money. BEST! Roberson Family"

I was recommended to him when I was about to undergo gastric bypass surgery. I wish I had found him sooner. The best thing about him is that he actually listens to my concerns, addresses them and provides me with answers. He doesn't rush out of the room and when I was ill, I could actually get an appointment. I feel as though my well being is his top priority. I would highly recommend him."

As a survivor of a bleeding cerebral aneurysm I needed a full service internist who could monitor my on-going rehabilitation. His availability, clarity, and capacities to refer me to other services as needed continue to be just what I need. The warmth, utility, and competence of his staff reflect the personality of care and concern of the doctor himself. I treasure the position of being able to stick with him."

He is very attentive, listens, and asks me questions. His detailed questions always lead me to make the best decisions for my health. I had an appointment today and arrived early. They accepted me early. There was no wait time. The next morning Dr. Diekroeger, just like clock work, called me with the results of my blood work. I recommended him to my daughter after she finished college and she absolutely loves him. The young lady who handles the referrals when you are checking out could use a crash course in customer service. I have never had a problem calling in to get a prescription refill. They call it in to the pharmacy promptly. I love this office!"

32,Dr. Robert A. Diekroeger,Atlanta,Georgia, Internists / Geriatricians , Male,21,4.34,2016-03-30T20:34:25.600Z,2,2,1,2,3,"My husband and I have both been to see him. In the beginning we were told by another patient that he is a great doctor, and we're young enough that we only really go for annual exams, or for medication refills. Originally he was good, listened fairly well, and we had what we needed, although wait times there are always long, the staff barely looks at you, and everything seems to rotate around the staff rather than patients based on response times, in-office manner, etc.
My husband stopped seeing him because in spite of him being in his early 30's the doctor would try to pressure him into getting a rectal exam. Few men are comfortable with that, and only need to when they are older.
We stopped going to him regularly when we moved out to the Buford, GA area away from Sandy Springs but we will no longer use him as a physician or give others in that area his name, and we sent quite a few patients his way.
Last time I needed my medication refilled the pharmacy had to send the request three times, and even then they did not respond until I called several different days, and the nurse and staff were rude, acted as if they could care less although I was concise and expressed the urgency. This time, the first refill request was sent from my pharmacy on the 15th, and they did not get a response until the 24th stating simply to call the office. The medication needed is not something I can pick, and I have been going without it waiting, and feeling the results. Doctor's offices, even slow ones, take care of refill requests within three business days. This took 10 days, and then it was a vague response. The nurse, doctor, and staff never bothered to call my number on file or make any effort to notify me of the delay. This is not only poor customer service, but it's unethical. I rated the staff as poor because even when I was happy as a patient I felt ignored - same for helpfulness. Their punctuality is terrible because they make you wait a long time to get into a room, and then a long time after that to see the doctor, and then it's a rush with little time to talk. Dr. Diekroeger's job knowledge is average for a medical internist. He would improve by continuing his knowledge of changes, and updates such as new diseases discovered during the human genome project, for example, such as MTHFR for example, which affects much more than pregnancy in the majority of patients and affects methylation.
I have family members who are M.D.s, physical therapists, anesthesiologists, among a few positions in the medical field, and they never make a patient wait so long.
Note: If you're looking for a doctor with balanced knowledge in both Western and alternative medicine, keep looking. The last time I spoke with him he said he thinks alternative medicine doesn't yield results.
I did notice many commenters said he just refers you to someone else. He has never done that, but referrals may have to do with people's insurance plan requirements. I don't know.
I do know I plan to write the Board about this situation and already left a voice mail with his nurse ""Tiffany"" indicating that I'm very upset about how I've been neglected when I need doctor approval for a mandatory medication refill."
33,Dr. Robert A. Diekroeger,Atlanta,Georgia, Internists / Geriatricians , Male,21,4.34,2014-02-11T12:48:54Z,1.3,1,2,1,1,"My father who has a severe heart condition, history of chronic kidney stones, high blood pressure and high cholesterol, called office to make appointment as new patient & WAS told doctor WAS accepting new patients and accepting Humana Insurance. My father waited several months for this appointment and provided all insurance information at the time of making his appointment. The day of the appointment my father was told the doctor was not accepting new patients. Was told by the office manager that the doctor looked at schedule and cancelled because he is not accepting new patients. This is discriminatory. I realize with healthcare changes physicians don't get reimbursed as much as they used to but HE and HIS staff should be ashamed of themselves for not having their ducks in a row. Secondly my father was previously a patient in the past but had to leave because doctor changed practices and new practice did not take his insurance. This doctor needs to put his patients first."

Diekroeger,Atlanta,Georgia, Internists / Geriatricians , Male,21,4.34,2012-09-12T13:42:40Z,3,3,3,2,4,"Although he is nice,knowledgeable and attentive, he just does referrals to specialists -two of the three specialists he sent me to were rude, unprofessional (in different ways), and did not seem to care, and made mistakes like forgetting to take blood for ordered tests and so I had to go back at my insurance company's expense. The 3rd of the referrals I never scheduled and found my own since they were so rude on the phone just trying to make an appt..So, if you just want your cholesterol and other basic tests checked and get referred then he is fine."

I have absolutely NO issues with him, his practice, or his staff. I would strongly recommend him with no hesitation to anyone in need of his services.
I cannot say enough positive things about this physician. He's knowledgeable, caring, and friendly. One time several years ago, I had a serious personal issue not related to my health visit that day, and it showed in my blood pressure reading that the nurse had taken when I came in.
As he was taking notes about the issue that I was there for that day he inquired about what was going on that may increase my BP. I started to tell him about what was going on in my life at that moment and I broke down and started to cry. I'm a 50 year old man who doesn't generally show his emotions, but something about this Dr. allows me to be open, honest and share things that may, or may not be relevant to the issue at hand. He immediately stood up from his computer where he was taking notes and hugged me until I stopped. Even after I gained composure he pulled up a chair and stayed close to me. It was one of the most cathartic moments of my life that this man, who I only see a few times a year at that, was generally concerned for what was going on in my life at that moment and it had nothing to do with why I was there to see him. I'll never forget that.
I don't know if the Dr's read these things about themselves, but if he sees this and knows who this is, I would say I don't think I can ever thank you enough for that moment. It was a single moment of selflessness that mattered to me more than anything.
Aside from all that sissy stuff I just mentioned, this Dr. is worth his weight.
He's not one to over prescribe, so if you're looking for someone to throw drugs at you, he's not your man. He's more interested in what's wrong and fixing it, than giving you a script for antibiotics or whatever when they aren't needed.
He's seen me through some pretty serious health complications ranging from heart issues to some serious injuries coming from living life to the fullest with an aging body that isn't 20 anymore but a mind that refuses to believe it.
I could not be happier with Dr. Malamis as my physician."

Dr. Malamis has been my primary care physician for five years, and I am very pleased with his competence, his relaxed and personable demeanor, responsiveness to my concerns, and the quality of referrals I have received from him. As others have noted, he is thoughtful and errs on the side of caution (but not to the extent that he over-orders diagnostic tests or over-prescribes) and he clearly keeps current on medical literature and practice standards. His staff is friendly, polite and efficient. I rarely have had to wait more than 10 minutes at scheduled appointments. He is as close to the ideal of a primary care physician as I could hope for, and I feel very lucky to be his patient."

He is laser focused -- I always feel that I have 100% of his attention and that there are no outside distractions. Dr. Malamis is very personable. He explains clearly and in a terms that I can easily understand. Conversation is effortless and natural. I feel that I'm not just an appointment on his calendar, but rather a person that he's making an investment in getting to know as a patient. I've recommended him to many friends and will continue to do so."

They apparently charged me $150 missed appointment fee for a missed annual check up! Then despite having my office number and email they sent one notice to my old address before turning my bill over to a collection agency. Thanks for trashing my credit guys!!

He takes time to listen, to ask good questions, and to encourage you to take an active role in your own healthcare. He's in this business to heal. Period. I've referred more than 10 people to him and no one has yet to be disappointed. Simply put: he rocks."

I called the office because my husband was coughing up a storm after taking a new medication and they said that there was nothing to do about that. When my husband came in they finally figured it was a side effect from the new medication they had put him on.

Malamis,Atlanta,Georgia, Internists / Geriatricians , Male,21,4.46,2009-04-14T20:31:29Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Malamis feels like he could be a friend while still having excellent knowledge of his field. He has no ego and will refer you to a specialist if he feels you need it. He will NOT try to treat outside his scope of practice but he WILL follow your care with the specialist he refers you to. He is in a quality office with other amazing doctors to work with. He error's on the side of caution. He will return your calls the same day and man, does he listen. He really listens, like a friend would. He seems to enjoy what he has chosen as his career and embraces it as 'service' rather than 'work'. His staff is professional and friendly. The great think as well is that if he does refer you to another doctor, you can be sure they are as high quality as he is. He's young, which I like because I can develop a relationship for life with him. He encourages you to partake in your care. If you are making educated choices support them. Encourages preventive care and alternative treatments. Caring."

He's one of those rare doctors that focuses 100% of his energy on you, each and every visit. He's a doctor that still honors the sanctity of the doctor-patient relationship and does not take lightly the stewardship his patients bequeath him for their care. This guy's compassion makes you question your preconceived ideas about doctors and his empathy makes you think he might be a long-lost friend. Uncannily intuitive, Dr. Malamis listens intently and always explains what's going on with me and his plan to get me healthy again. Best of all, he does this all in lanquage I can understand. I believe it is Dr. Malamis' ""humanism"" coupled with his knowledge that makes him a superior care-giver. If you are one of Dr. Malamis patients, count yourself fortunate. I certainly do. E.B."

She listens to you and answers all questions. She is straight to the point and I like that. In her efforts to answer all questions she can be a little late. So be ready for a wait.
52,Dr. Juliet Asher,Atlanta,Georgia, Internists / Geriatricians , Female,9,4.63,2009-01-15T12:41:21Z,4.5,4,4,5,5,"Top Notch! Absolutely thorough. If she is a little late coming into the examination room, be patient. She is giving the previous patient the time they need to talk and answer questions. Take a book, read knowing you will soon be in excellent care."
53,Dr. Juliet Asher,Atlanta,Georgia, Internists / Geriatricians , Female,9,4.63,2008-12-08T16:17:57Z,3.5,4,4,2,4,"I actually found Dr. Asher to be abrasive, dismissive, and she would actually cut me off several times while I was talking about my symptoms. She was also dismissive of my specialist's concerns about why she sent me back to her for an unrelated problem."
54,Dr. Juliet Asher,Atlanta,Georgia, Internists / Geriatricians , Female,9,4.63,2008-10-14T16:05:17Z,5,5,5,5,5,"I've been going to Dr. Asher for 4 years, she is a good listener, through in her exams, when I was really sick she called to check up on me which is un heard of.

56,Dr. Juliet Asher,Atlanta,Georgia, Internists / Geriatricians , Female,9,4.63,2008-04-16T10:28:55Z,4.8,5,5,4,5,"Very prompt and thorough, does not rush you, takes time to answer questions. I was early for my appointment, and they took me when I arrived. My appointment was on a Friday, I got my lab tests back the next Monday. Her staff are wonderful and friendly."

60,Dr. Daniel S. Goodman,Atlanta,Georgia, Internists / Geriatricians , Male,11,4.61,2013-06-19T14:19:40Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Goodman is AWESOME! Pam will get you in quickly and if you need answers the office is very efficient. I believe in the past 16 years I can only remember one person on staff changing. Dr. Goodman has been rated very highly in publications and he is very knowledgeable. If you are looking for warm and fuzzy, he may not be your guy... but he is very competent and cares about his patients. He also has a good network of Dr's that he will refer you to, for any specialty needs."
61,Dr. Daniel S. Goodman,Atlanta,Georgia, Internists / Geriatricians , Male,11,4.61,2012-12-03T15:08:50Z,4.5,5,5,3,5,"Interesting how people often see the same things in another person, more specifically doctors. I too find Dr. Goodman smart, punctual, and accurate in diagnosis. But after a dozen or so office visits I can say the good doctor needs to lighten-up a bit. He at times does reflect arrogance while often dismissing a patient's self-diagnonsis in a condescending manner. He's just lacking some social skills and a bed-side manner, not uncommon in the medical industry these days. It might be tempting to say a smart doctor and a good diagnosis is all that matters, but we all wanted to be treated with a little respect and personal touch - it actually helps in the healing process. And, since it's my body, and I have a couple of college degrees myself -my own ideas about my health may not be that off the wall."

If you require a warm-and-fuzzy kind of experience, he's not your guy. However, he is hyper-competent, so I happily put up with the gruffness for effectiveness. His staff is solid and, as far as I can tell, has almost no turnover."
63,Dr. Daniel S. Goodman,Atlanta,Georgia, Internists / Geriatricians , Male,11,4.61,2010-11-25T18:49:58Z,4.8,5,4,5,5,"I have been going to Dr. Goodman for about 15 years. He is the best internist in Atlanta! My friend had some rare infection that no physician could diagnose, but Dr. G found the cause and treated it successfully. He is professional, personable and the staff is very efficient. You get lab results and prescription refills within 24 hours, and flu shots are free! When I have a medical question, he or his staff supply the answer ASAP, usually while I'm still on the phone. I pray he never retires!"

65,Dr. Daniel S. Goodman,Atlanta,Georgia, Internists / Geriatricians , Male,11,4.61,2009-07-16T10:52:00Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Goodman is a well respected physician in whom I have complete trust. He has been my primary doctor for over 20 years. He focuses on wellness and does not dispense medicine unless it is absolutely necessary. There is not a doubt he has the health of his patients as top priority. His office continues to employ several patient services not often used today. An example is the next day feedback on routine blood tests and the Doctor speaks to the patient personally. A person, versus a machine, answers the phone during work hours. Calls are returned promptly. I cannot say enough positive comments about Dr. Goodman and his office."
66,Dr. Daniel S. Goodman,Atlanta,Georgia, Internists / Geriatricians , Male,11,4.61,2008-03-28T07:42:04Z,5,5,5,5,5,I have been a patient of Dr Goodman's for years. He is very thorough and caring. His sense of humour is very dry so some might think him aloof but he really does care for his patients.

Goodman,Atlanta,Georgia, Internists / Geriatricians , Male,11,4.61,2007-12-14T13:52:57Z,3.5,5,4,2,3,"If you are searching for Dr. Goodman at 4553 Shallowford Rd (there are several listed), this guy was unfriendly, said rude things to me, the examination was not very complete, I felt ripped off, and not listened too. The complex he is in looks old. The equipment also looks a bit old. This guy claimed some things that really didn't seem that accurate. There were several Goodmans listed in GA, this is my experience with this one, can anyone clarify if this is the same guy everyone has so highly rated?"

The only downside is the very long waits, but I think this is because she spends so much time in the room with you, so she tends to get behind. Dr. Morgan is extremely caring and very thorough.

I have known him since he started i guess 18 years ago. He looks real young, i thought candid camera was going to come out when i first met him, he looked so young... we hit it off and never looked back. great sense of humor, LISTENS......SMART as a whip, did great in school, head of his class.

Can't leave without paying co-pay, but their error prone accounting system said one was not paid. So they insist upon it being paid, even though I proved many times that their accounting system yielded errors that I caught and they adjusted. Stay away from Piedmont Physicians Group and Dr. Peters did involve himself in this business dispute therefore be aware."

Easy to schedule--one visit he had already reviewed my MRI's on line before I'd even told him about them. It's hard to feel bad because he cracks me up every visit. Great warmth and compassionate too boot. It's great to find a Dr. as bright as his is and also have great report with people. I love the e-mail option which saves times and opens up doctor-patient report. Always answered fast. Razor wit, be on your toes. Don't be put off because he looks too young to have credentials. He does, I checked. They're impressive."

The first time I had a problem, he said he wasn't concerned. I said I was and he became very angry that I wanted to find out what my symptoms meant. The practice is so large, apparently he wasn't interested in anything that may require him to think....I went to another M.D who diagnosed me within 10mins. of talking to him and telling him my symptoms. He even had a plan to follow if the diagnosis was not correct.He stated my symptoms were a concern and something to check out unlike Shulman. Never again.."

He completely failed to diagnose my cancer even after repeated appointments throughout the year. Most disturbing, was his failure to follow up with me once I was diagnosed. His explanation for my symptoms was ""depression"" which was a far cry from the true diagnosis of acute leukemia.

I have seen him for over 4 years now and recommended him to others many times. He really takes time and listens to you and ask questions. He doesn't try to treat evertying and refers you to a specialist if he sees a need for that. He is super friendly, has a great sense of humor and very very carring person. I wish more doctors were like him."

Yes, he's not the warmest individual and he's rather matter of fact... but I find it refreshing. I feel like I'm getting very straight forward answers that aren't influenced by anything beyond my best interest. He's also not easily ""convinced"" of anything nor is he ready to sign me up for any ole pill. He's a hardworking, well-rounded doctor whom I trust. (And as the majority of our experience and interactions been uninsured on my part - he has offered me discounts where he can.)"

Even though there is a sign in the treatment room that states ""let me know if you aren't being heard or feel rushed"", I always felt that the clock was ticking. Not always confident with his assessment of every situation. I am ""white coat"" hypertensive anyway and seeing him didn't help matters. Was not the best fit for me and should have changed doctor's much earlier. The practice also stopped taking United Healthcare insurance."

As is written here in other posts, he is condescending, rude and completely cold, ice cold. He should be a judge, not a doctor. Seek other physicians in this practice."

He always greats me by name and with a smile. He is professional in his dealings with me and congratulates me for progress I have made. When I haven't taken advice he has given, he looks for other options or alternatives that might motivate me more. I give David Spivey ""two thumbs up"". He has listened to me when I needed to talk. He has given me enough information for me to feel as if I actively participate in my health care choices. His treatments have contributed to my lower blood pressure and cholesterol. He has switched medications quickly when I identified side-effects. He has referred me to competent specialists who treated conditions about which DS is not an expert."

Adequate clinician for most routine health issues, but in over his head with more complicated issues. (I have corrected him on a number of occasions based on my own research). Nice office. Helpful staff. Good online access to lab results and other info."

Over the holidays I was experiencing an excrutiatingly painful back spasm, and called the office to see if they could squeeze me in. The receptionist said my doc was on vacation, but called me back within 20 minutes to schedule an appointment w/Dr.B 2 hours later. He performed a thorough exam -- more thorough than I would have anticipated given how busy the office seemed (and the fact that I was not his patient). He took considerable time to discuss the drugs he was prescribing, and was careful to check my med/Rx history (which the office maintains online -- no paper files!). He futher took time to discuss numerous longer-term therapies, including physical therapy, acupuncture, massage and chiropractic treatments (and his opinion as to whether/how each might help the situation), and provided recommendations on where to go for those services. Incredibly thorough and personable. The guy and the practice is top-notch."

I've had other doctors who would not take much time answering my questions, and when they did they were rude or condescending. Dr. Marcus listens to your questions, and if he doesn't know the answer (which he usually does), he finds out! He has also referred me to other very good doctors. Like another reviewer, I have a friend who is a doctor, and I asked him who he goes to! I love this doctor. I asked him, ""What am I going to do when you retire?"" He said, ""I've got two kids to send through college, I'll be here forever!"" Ha! He's helpful, smart and perfect bedside manner. GO SEE HIM NOW."
133,Dr. Robert M. Marcus,Atlanta,Georgia, Internists / Geriatricians , Male,4,5,2012-02-20T01:13:13Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Marcus is amazing. He takes his time with you. He doesn't rush. He listens. He makes you a priority. Dr. Marcus is very thorough and leaves no stone unturned. Dr. Marcus will follow up with you to make sure you're feeling better after a few days if he doesn't hear back from you. I haven't found many MD's such as Dr. Marcus. I've sent several friends to him and they've all LOVED him. There is no one else like him, and don't think there will ever be another one close to him!!"
134,Dr. Robert M. Marcus,Atlanta,Georgia, Internists / Geriatricians , Male,4,5,2009-11-13T10:29:41Z,5,5,5,5,5,"I went to Dr.Marcus because friends of mine who ARE doctors think he's one of the best. I couldn't agree more! He's professional. He listens well and provides only appropriate referrals and tests. It feels like he takes time to hear me, but doesn't waste time. Great staff too."
135,Dr. Robert M. Marcus,Atlanta,Georgia, Internists / Geriatricians , Male,4,5,2009-03-14T11:33:57Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Marcus is the best doctor I have seen. My whole family, including 4 sisters and parents have seen him for 10+ years. I had to move away for about a year and was having medical issues. No one could figure it out. The first time I saw Dr. Marcus, he knew right away that I had a large blood clot in my lung. He caught it just in time. He is such a caring and thorough doctor!"

I always feel that I am in caring hands and I think she goes the extra mile to ensure that her patients are satisfied. And, to endure that what she prescribes in meds or next steps is medically sound. My appreciation and satisfaction level with Dr. Tinanoff is extremely high.

She helps me understand my medical reports good and bad. Additionally she comforts me and guides me through the bad diagnosis.

Felt rushed starting with the front desk, visit with Dr. Small and the rest of the staff. Dr. Small had the wrong ""chart"" even though it was on the computer. Return phone calls are non-extistant. Have been trying to get my medical records transferred and was told there is a 30.00 charge for copying and sending- ridiculous!! and that I must send a check. "" The Credit Card processor is not working today...."" Sealed the deal on my decision to switch practices. I've had better customer experiences at government offices!"

He is willing to check into each of your concerns. I have recently made a decision to leave this doctor due to his staff. They are not good at returning phone calls, I was waiting for a referral and was told that I would be given a call with one, never got one. I called back 3 separate days to both of his medical assistances and have received no return call. Now I have been awaiting blood work results that I was told would have given to me a week ago. I have called, left messages and still to this day, no response. I find this highly unprofessional. Great service starts with the frontline. Dr. Small is a good doctor but I won't be returning due to the negligence of his staff."

He appears to be caring and knowledgeable with concern for my overall health. Although he is in a large practice, I feel Dr. Small takes time to explain his thoughts on your care and he is not quick to use medications, if not needed. Dr. Small's nurse/MA was personable, efficient, and competent. I highly recommend Dr. Small."

I have been having allergy problems and since the over the counter medicine wasn’t helping I thought I’d go see a doctor. A week ago I had also had an allergic reaction to soy milk and was still feeling sick. I was in the room waiting for Dr. Small to come in and he just walked in without even knocking. I know this may sound petty but I’ve never been somewhere where the Dr or nurse just walked in without even knocking. I started to tell him my symptoms and he kept interrupting me and cutting me off. I told him my chest was feeling tight and I was feeling short of breath and wheezing – he brushed this off and just gave me a nasal spray and inhaler. Obviously, he did not take the time to see that I have a heart rhythm disorder. He didn’t even ask if I had any other allergies. I should have just waited for Dr. Varner – she’s the best. Dr. Small is rude and he mumbles."

I was looking for a doctor that would take time with me, and explain in detail any/all results. I am so tired of meeting with a doctor, and he's in and out within 30 sec. This was not the case here.

I've been a patient for ten years (almost since he got out of residency) and have nothing but great things to say. 1st & foremost, the guy knows his stuff - his diagnoses have always been decisive & spot on (including a perforrated appendix where my white count was completely normal but he didn't buy it and may have saved me by ordering the CT anyway). 2nd, he's never condescending and always willing to explain things (he's even photocopied pages from medical texts for me). 3rd, he's just a likable guy you almost wish you could hang out with if it weren't for that Dr/patient thing. bottom line: nobody's perfect but there's not much to be critical of here..."

I have been seeing Lonnie for over 12 years and it feels like he is part of the family, in fact he treats my family and a bunch of my friends that I referred to him and they all say thank you! My father in law has heart issues and Lonnie walked him through all the issues at Saint Joe to make sure he got the best treatment not simply a referral as most doctors do. He insists that any specialist you see send him a copy of all the information to add to his file so his records are complete and totally up to date."

He has OUTSTANDING bedside manner, is knowledgeable, thorough, keeps up with current information, ALWAYS takes time to listen, and is both compassionate and empathetic. He keeps excellent records and refers to them on every visit. He's can be funny too! (can you say Patch Adams). His in practice with others in his group, but the others don't even compare to Lonnie. This is the best PCP I've ever had the pleasure to know. He has been blessed with a gift.

I never had this treatment with our former office and all I can say is if you want rude and you want to be nickel and dimed, try CFM.

He has worked collaboratively with other specialists as needed, and keeps me informed about whatever is going on.

Very knowledgeable, thorough, and honest. He isn't afraid or reluctant to speak with you directly, I have called and spoke to him direct and he has called me for follow up. I recommend everyone to him. BTW, If you don't have insurance you can afford to see him, because he doesn't charge outrageous prices for self pay! That is stellar!

Follows up with you personally and you can ALWAYS get an appt. SAME DAY, but you may have to wait a bit, so ASK if time is a factor for you and you ""could"" wait until tomorrow. Also if you are there for just bloodwork, REMIND his staff so you don't wind up waiting ""in line"". He does have staff turnover, so YOU need to remind them why you're there. Remember, he will spend as much time as you need from him when it is your turn -- so be a patient patient. He always returns calls if you have any further questions. Treats everyone in our family from ages 16 to 53, and always asks about each of us when he sees one of us. Started with him over 9 years ago, based on recommendation of an ER nurses at hospital. They said he pays attention to details and he does! I have some conditions that require treatment with other specialities and he coordinated VERY WELL -- which hasn't been true for many of my other doctors. That's why we stay!"

I have been with him since then and feel comfortable.

He has been instrumental in diagnosing health issues that we did not know we had. Thanks to him, my husband is alive today. As for me, he diagnosed two life threatening health conditions that I have and now I am getting help for these conditions. He is very informed, professional and leaves no stone unturned. I am not one that takes a person's opinion at first. I have to be shown and the individual must prove to me that they are correct. Dr. Gudur did that and even more. I highly recommend him to ANYONE looking for a super primary care physician."

They recently moved to an office on Pirkle Ferry Road. The new office is clean and cool. I reccommend Dr. Gudur to anyone. He is an M.D. and an F.A.C.G.S.

This is very unprofessional. I waited for over 3 hours just for some bloodwork. The office was dirty. The doctor did not use gloves. His office is open Saturdays and that is the only reason I stayed...but never again. I rather die.

I have found him to be extremely knowledgeable, competent and professional. When necessary he has referred me to top notch specialist. I have recommended him several friends.
As to some reviews stating his was rude, I do not know who they saw , as I absolutely CANNOT imagine him being rude. "

From what I understand it was because I cancelled an appt and had not been able to reschedule it with work travel and then the holidays - when I called to schedule this morning the scheduler told me I was fired as a patient and there was nothing I could do about it. She said it was because I tried to fill prescriptions without my routine appts. The ONLY request for refills came from my pharmacy which has me on auto refill. No call from the dr office, no note until I get the letter this afternoon. I am astounded, I liked Dr Faruque and have given him great reviews in the past. I've been told that this is part of the affordable care - if you don't got to every appt the Dr does not get the full reimbursement when you do go so they drop you from their patient list. Really sad that this is what it comes to. 30 days to find a new doctor and then you are out on your own - so much for patent CARE!

Could be because he is too cheap to hire degreed qualified staff and uses non-degreed medical assistant to do all his work. You will wait over an hour to be seen and then all he will do is send you for blood work and write a prescription. Very incompetent. I would not send my dog to him

He is always courteous and seems to have the answers to a wide variety of medical questions. His referrals to other specialists have been top notch as well. The staff not only at the front desk as well as his nurse are very helpful and quick to get back to you. Waiting time is very minimal and return calls are very quick. This Dr gets 6 stars if there was such a rating."

This ER doctor uses Faruque as his personal internist. Well, we have never been happier with a doctor! He is so completely thorough and professional. We have recommended Dr. Faruque to our families, and now 4 other family members are going to Faruque. We all have very different issues, and we all find Dr. Faruque extremely intelligent, knowledgeable and resourceful. He has a wonderful bedside manner.

She did nothing to assuade my fears except to give me a free sample of Lunestra. Her staff does not/cannot schedule appointments in a timely manner. Referrals must be begged for. The feeling I get from the entire operation (Doctor, Nurse, receptionist) is that they just really don't care about their patients."

He takes time to listen to you and all your ailments. He acts like you're the most fascinating patient he's ever encountered, even when all you have is a simple sinus infection. He is wonderful about knowing when to treat a problem himself and when to refer you to a specialist. He seems quite knowledgeable about the latest in medical treatments, but still treats his patients ""conservatively"" so as to minimize side effects. I cannot say enough about Dr. Gonzalez; he is my favorite doctor of all time, and I've had some good ones!"

Although I found her to be thorough In her approach, I have to agree with others on this site that her bedside manner is somewhat officious. I only saw her two or three times because on my first visit her staff had me undress to the waist (I am female) then left me sitting outside of the exam room clothed only in a paper gown, next to a male patient. During the time that I was sitting there, patients and staff were coming and going and I felt very exposed. I was never able to really get over that or feel comfortable there again as it seemed to show a lack of concern for patient privacy, so I found a different internist."

She serves my entire family -- she is knowledgeable and makes sure you are doing the correct things to ensure that you stay healthy. She does make you come in quarterly if you have chronic problems like I have. This is good practice. She wants to know what is happening to you now before just renewing your prescriptions. She is particularly good for persons with diabetes and knows the specialist doctors in Atlanta very well. She does have a busy practice but prioritizes sick patients to ensure that they are seen that day. Overall I rate her top notch.

My mother and sister see her as well, and my father, brother and grandparents see her husband. I respect and appreciate the fact that she is hesitant to overprescribe medication unless it is really necessary. Thought there often is a long wait I have never left unsatisfied. Dr. Rabbi treats my entire family with the utmost level of care."

At first, I was impressed with her thoroughness, but not so any more. She is quite full of herself and thinks her opinion is definitive. This keeps her from being able to really listen and respond to me as an individual. She runs too many needless tests - always normal results, and has misdiagnosed me several times! Once I had a rash on my buttock and she exclaimed loudly that I had genital herpes! After tests revealed this diagnosis was not correct and that it was allergy related, she never apologized for traumatizing me. She always marks up the insurance forms with extra diagnosis I don't have - so she can collect more money? I also see a specialist for arthritis and Crohns (in remission,) but Dr. Rabbi always has a problem with the treatment or medication my other doctors prescribe, creating conflict. Dr. Rabbi usually calls me by the wrong name and has several times expressed disapproval for my hyphenated last name. Needless visits, tests, rude!"

She takes her time, listens very carefully, and genuinely cares about how you're feeling. She does not push meds and then shove you out the door. It's the total opposite.

I have been a patient for over 20 years and I have NEVER once been disappointed. She is extremely caring and takes her time. Many years ago before I went with a complaint about my legs moving all the time. She brought out her books and showed me about Restless Leg Syndrome. This was way before you even heard about it! She does not push meds which I appreciate, since so many doctors seem to do this now adays. Also, every specialist she has ever referred me to has been fantastic. I can not recommend her enough!!!!!!!!!!!"

I have been a patient of Dr. Paulk since he purchased the practice from Dr. Forsyth (8+ years). For the past two years I have not talked to nor have I seen Dr. Paulk. All of my visits and discussions have been with Lindsey. Lindsey is not an MD and is very cold, overwhelmed and seems detached from my overall health and care. I was hospitalized a year ago with a stomach disorder. I went for a follow up visit to see Dr. Paulk and got Lindsey. When I ask to see Dr. Paulk and he is never available. The last issue I had I was dealing with Sarah (an intern) that was acting as Lindsey's assistant. I have been relegated to the PA's intern assistant. I feel a little cheated since I have entrusted my health care with Dr..Paulk all these years. I think Dr. Paulk is a great MD, honest and super easy to talk to. I guess he has changed direction in how his office is run. Very disappointed and will miss his care."

Paulk,Atlanta,Georgia, Internists / Geriatricians , Male,8,3.97,2007-08-27T20:24:50Z,4.5,5,3,5,5,My first visit to Dr. Paulk was because my regular doctor was on vacation and I got ill. He spent about 45 min (!) with me--had a great manner and accurate diagnosis. He's very likable and smart. He's keen to have his office techno-savvy. I switched to him even beore my regular doctor retired. Another plus is an easily accessable office with free parking--his office is near Hammond Park in Sandy Springs. I would recommend him highly.

She was briefly my doctor many years ago, and she performed my first pelvic exam and pap smear. I was young and terrified, and I found the procedure very painful. She insisted that there must be some psychological reason I was in so much pain (my virginity had been verbally established, by the way), and she asked whether I had been the victim of sexual assault. I hadn't, but that's quite a question to ask casually, while adjusting a speculum. When I answered her question, she said, ""well, that's the only reason this would hurt, so you must be lying . . . and if you're going to lie to me, I can't be your doctor."" A few minutes later, I was in such pain that I requested the exam be stopped. She refused. "

I just moved to Georgia not too long ago and was wanting to establish care with a new PCP here. I called and scheduled a doctor's appt with her (2 month wait) and 1 month before my appt, her clinic calls me to reschedule my appt. They told me I was her last appt for the day and that she has a prior function she is attending. Then they tried to pass me off to one of the other doctors in the clinic. So the receptionist has me rescheduled for the day before my original appt. Well, today was my doctor's appt and I show up and they do not have me in the computer. They inform me the appt is tomorrow. I inform them that was my original appt date and that I was rescheduled. I had to change my time off request with work as well, so it was a large ordeal. Then they tell me that I was never rescheduled, but that I can wait be a work in appt. I inform them that I have meetings today and that I don't have long that I could wait. They let me know it will be a quick wait. Then Dr. Bernard's medical assistant comes out to talk to me and informs me that it will be a few hours before I am seen. Then asks when I could reschedule and that they will work around my schedule. This whole ordeal wasted my time, wasted my gas, and wasted money that I could have earned from going to work like normal. I know it will not hurt them to lose me as a patient, because I will definitely never be back, but I am in the medical field and when I am asked by other patients or friends who I recommend, I will definitely tell them not this office. I am sure in other circumstances, they have been great, but they messed up BEYOND BIG time with me as a patient. I am very displeased! I had to call a new PCP and now I have to wait another month just to be seen!"

He correctly diagnosed my problem as acid reflux, but he never asked me about my diet. He just me some expensive pills to take for the rest of my life. Anyway, I eventually stopped taking the pills. I changed my diet and lowered my carbs, and now I rarely have problems with reflux. But he was of no help in diagnosing the real problem. A few years later, I had some lab work done. Even though my glucose level was in the pre-diabetic range, Dr. Dannehl called it ""normal."" He just told me to get a little more exercise, which was poor advice, since I was already getting a lot of exercise. After doing more research (including paying for my own glucose meter!), I discovered that my body cannot tolerate a lot of carbs, so I made some major adjustments. He gave me absolutely NO advice about lowering my carbs or changing my diet. If I'd listened to him, I would've probably ended up with diabetes in a few years."

I tried getting copies of my xrays for 6 months and his horrible staff kept saying they would send it and never would until I threatened to report him to the Medical Board and they finally threw it in an envelope and hand wrote my name and address on it - no cover letter or anything.

In the fall I went in for a simple opinion on a vein and the nurse practitioner kept asking me if I needed anything else which I thought was odd, she suggested a flu shot so I got one.

I came early to fill out paperwork and the wait time was over 30 minutes in the waiting area and then in the room even though there were no other patients in the office. (Which I found strange for a PCP's office) When Dr. Parry came into the room, he didn't even take a history( I was a new patient) and rushed through the whole exam, not allowing me to talk and informing me that if I wanted to address any specific concerns, I'd have to make further appointments. When the phlebotomist came to draw my blood for labs--he missed several important labs we had discussed earlier. I suffer from high cholesterol, but have normal triglycerides, yet he prescribed a medication solely for elevated triglycerides. He prescribed me a high dose of Vit D, but did not draw labs for a Vit D level. It took weeks to get the results back from the labs on the patient portal after calling the front desk numerous times. I received a bill from the lab with charges of almost $2,000 for extremely specialized and an unecessary quantity of labs he had ordered for my annual without informing me or without my consent. I thought I was only getting a PAP test. Their billing department never answered or returned my mesages either. Very disatisfied with the dishonesty and lack of quality of care I have received. I will not be be returning or referring anyone there."

The staff was very rude and unhelpful. The girl assigned to do my blood work looked like she just woke up and stepped out of jail and ignored me when I told her I was feeling faint. I told her no less than three times that I did not feel right and she left me alone in the room for half an hour without ANYONE checking on me after bloodwork. I am not a stranger to lab work and most places make sure that if you say you are feeling faint you have something to get your blood sugar right again. This placed failed at even the most basic level of care. I will never go back and am making sure everyone I know knows to avoid this place.

His staff are always professional and courteous.
I have never had a problem getting an appointment fast and at a convenient time.
I believe Dr Perry saved my life. He diagnosed a gallbladder issue that I thought was indigestion and I had emergency surgery that night. The surgeon said my gallbladder was close to rupture and could have killed me.
When his practice moved from their old building to the current one I changed family doctor to one closer to home but the care was far below the standard I have received from Dr Perry so I went back and the 35 minute drive is well worth the extra time

His care was very sporadic, he often seemed exhausted and distracted and missed things that were fairly obvious. Getting appointments for a regular office visit proved to be very difficult unless there was adequate financial incentive, i.e. physical with lots of tests. His office staff while friendly was slow and poorly informed. Billing questions were often incompletely answered and the reasoning for tests unclearly explained. Referrals to other physicians were also questionable. Not an office or MD that I would recommend."

I never had to wait more than 15 minutes, and he always spent as much time with me as needed for a thorough appointment. He even fit me in on a few hours notice when I had a softball injury that hurt but which I didn't think required the ER (turned out to be a fractured wrist, but seeing him probably saved many hours of my life from the ER waiting room). His referrals to several specialists I have had to visit have all been excellent. His bedside manner is fantastic, and I can honestly say my wife and I consider him to be a friend although we have never spent any time with him outside his office.

I has a past patient of the hospital so all they had to do was check my records and type up a letter and charge me a reasonable price but that's now what happened. Dr Paymen seemed cold to me. I prefer lively people and she is more matter of fact and serious, which is fine, but it's nice to at least know there's a real person behind the eyes staring at you. She asked me pertinent questions, and asked me did I need any prescriptions even though I was paying cash and that was extra. it was like she didn't really listen to me. I would not call her pleasant but she was not rude at all, just aloof and distant. She seemed rushed but the office was busy so that's understandable. I was charged 136.00 for one sentence!

She has never come off warm or even engaging. During our visits, she often seemed rushed and is often not very plesant. The last straw was when I decided to compile a list of all my symptoms to give to her. When I handed her the list, she handed it back without looking more than a few seconds, and asked which were the 3 worst problems. This was out of a list of a dozen symptoms. I then took this list and goolged it, and wheat intolorance was one of the results that showed up so I decided to stop eating wheat to see if that helped. After 1 month of being wheat free, I'm feeling 100% better after years of being an Emory Patient. No more dizziness, headaches, my insulin was cut in half. My chest pain is gone. I've even lost 20 pounds. When I brought up my idea of wheat intolerance I was basically told to go get another Primary Care Physican by Emory. Not acceptable"

He is a very nice, easygoing guy but is totally on his game as a physician, and all of his staff are also nice and very professional. He organizes several annual events for Altzheimer's research and treatment, the disease that took his father. He has taken a turn as head of Crawford Long Hospital in Atlanta.

The nurses go out of their way to help you get the care you need. The Office manager and clerical staff, on the other hand, send me into a tailspin almost every time I'm there. They have an attitude that they are bothered each time you check in or as a question or for clarification.

While I am in generally good health I had found that Dr. Polekoff, while maybe trying to be cautious and more thorough, ran significant additional tests for anything even close to borderline levels, including fasting glucose levels of 95-100.Instead of treating first with diet and exercise he immediately prescribed Metformin and blood pressure medication(while I have never had high blood pressure readings in my life.) I made the mistake of filling these prescriptions without ever taking them. Unknown to me this is now permanently on my RX record which immediately disqualifies me for anything but high risk high cost health insurance on an individual plan.

We are both older and I can tell you that as long as Dr. Crowell is practicing in Atlanta, I will stay her patient. I've sent many, many people to her and they've all remained patients. There are times when the wait is longer than it should be, but you see a REAL DOCTOR as opposed to a nurse practitioner or a med student. She listens, she talks, she cares and she is good. Worth every minute of the wait time."

Really need to impruve on punctuality. Because if I'm late I have to reschedule and possibly be charged a no show fee."

Lastly, Dr. Crowell is not board certified, so I switched doctors. She and Kimberly are very nice however."

I must admit that I am part of the problem as I ran Dr Holbrook late as I had more issues than I thought and some were serious. I thought they were insignificant. When you have something significant I think he will take with you as well. The office staff were helpful and I felt his nurse was excellent. I had difficulty with my meds and she took time to explain them to me and help get some meds at a cheaper price that I was not aware of. I was very pleased."

I think some of the issues with doctors running late is that we patients try to cover a years worth of ailments at a sore throat visit or we are not willing to take some personal responsibility for ourselves. I was very pleased and have been a patient for many years.

He has diagnosed correctly some ailments that previouse doctors could not. He is very caring. He is often behind schedule; but I will tolerate lateness any day for a good doctor. Thes administrative staff is not so good, but again, that does diminish Dr. Holbrook's competence. I never had a problem when requesting a referral, and felt he offered referrals at appropriate times."

The staff has a horrible attitude and acts put out over anything. This doctor and all the others at this practice(i've seen most of them) are nothing but conceited, and arrogant. Patients are not put first at this practice! Egos and finance are always put first there. When is it that doctors quite being doctors and suddenly became better than anyone and anything else around them. They act as if it is a privilege for you to be in their mere presence. So much so they only give you 5 minutes or less. I would not recommend anyone to go to this practice unless your the type that wants to stay frustrated and never get the treatment that you need."

The staff was friendly, with great smiles that immediately put you at ease. I wish could say the same for Dr. Wotton. He walked in reading my chart, continued to read it for 3-5 minutes. He never once looked at me nor greeted me during this time. I thought he must be busy. No he is simply very RUDE!!!!! We talked briefly, said I must be diabetic due my family genetic (I'm African American). FYI, my family doesn't have a history of diabetic anything... Not sure why he is rated as high online. I want the truth coupled with knowledge, and a little caring would have been nice. I have a true dislike for him personally, but his knowledge appears to be on point. In order to be a patient of his you must never question, have an oppinion regarding your health outcome or love taking super high doses of meds with strong side effects and like the ever present, ""I'm Right"" so just do it , now I have more patients to see feeling you get each time."

He is smart, kind, and truly cares about his patients. He is flexible, and even went out of his way to complete a medical form for me. I will always be grateful for his recommendation that my thyroid be removed, after two years of inconclusive biopsies, especially since the thyroid ended up containing cancerous nodules. Because of Dr. Wotton's recommendation at the perfect time, I will need no further treatment. I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Wotton.

I am, however, not overly sensitive and can handle unique humor and bluntness. He was able to properly diagnose my misdiagnosis from a previous doctor (who was truly horrible btw) and gave great information on day to day practices. Coming to him was a relief! Wotton knows his stuff and continues to be of great help. His assistant Stacey is also amazing, very straightforward, and will do what she can to help as well. Overall, I know that when it's time to see him that he will give it to me straight and make me laugh at least once. Cool doctor."

He may be good at treating diagnosed problems, but in my opinion he's not very good at diagnosing new ones. I can't rate his knowledge because he's barely ever spoken to me. Also, he made a disparaging comment about his staff which I thought was rude. And he literally talks to you like he thinks you're an imbecile. I've been to see him twice and ended up crying both times. I will never go back."

She is very personable and takes the time to listen to me. She does not make me feel rushed and she allows me to explain my symptoms in my way and she listens! I love this trait about her. HOWEVER, I only tolerate her staff for her. I hope she reads this and makes an attempt to speak weekly with her staff. I dislike the nurse that preceded her follows her. If a patient didn't know Dr. Banks they wouldn't like her based on her staff and i hate that. The nurses have a tone that is rude and uncaring. I know more about my nurses medical issues that my own. Her nurses make you feel like, get over it other people have worse your whining. Rose takes a bit to long to call patients back as well."

She is very pro active when caring for her patients.

I usually found her very remote but that was fine because until now I have been healthy and just wanted a doctor who is qualified and competent (which she is). I made a special appointment because I felt a lump in my breast. I saw an associate of Dr Chitwood because she was out of town. Then I went to the Piedmont breast center where I had biopsies. . Dr Chitwood called to give me the results. She was breathtakingly matter of fact and
delivered this shocking news (for me) as if I was keeping her from something more important. I could not catch my breath and she was asking very impatiently if I had any questions. And forget about ""continuity of care"" at Piedmont. I was basically on my own after that. I could not get in at all with the surgeon they recommended and when I called Chitwood back to ask her ""what nowl"" and to find out about how to get my scans and records she was incredibly rude and insensitive. She told me in an impatient way that she wAs not an administrator and that I would have t ask her staff these kinds of questions. When I told her I could not get in to see the surgeon she had no alternative suggestions other than to just see one of his associates although the radiologist (the wonderful Dr, Jeffrey Allen) had already told me he had discussed my case with this surgeon. If I survive the ordeal I am about to go through it will not be at Piedmont and I will find a new primary care physician with an emphasis on CARE."

I find her very knowledgeable and friendly too. I have rarely ever waited more than 15 minutes. On a few occasions other than routine physicals, they have gotten me in quickly.

Last 2 sick visits, DR told me I had something other than what I had; she refused to prescribe appropriate medicine; I ended up having to go to walk-in clinics to get treated w/ corect meds.

I just got off the phone with Jodi Chitwood who was the after hours ""On-call"" doctor of Piedmont Physicians Group on the night I called. I have never spoken with any doctor who was less helpful and at the same time, more rude. I have been a patient within the Piedmont Physicians Group for over 20 years and this is my first negative experience with anyone in that group. It is no wonder that one commenter noted that her staff was rude and appeared not to want to work there. Rudeness or politeness in a doctor's office starts at the top.

Although he seem like he is not listening at time he is really listening more than you think. Then he comes back with a solution. He will even take the time to call and check on you. Who does that these day? He never make you feels like he's in a hurry. I am sure he has plenty of patients to see. I refuse to go anywhere else. If I go to a specialtist, he is my 2nd opinion. I have to get his approval before I get anything else done. He is the best. He is one who told me I have fibromyalgia after seeing tons of doctors. I love this man."

I once waited over a half an hour in the examination room (this was after putting in my time in the waiting area) for Dr. Brown-Saddler. It was as if no one told her that I was in the room waiting. I have since changed doctors because, although she is a good doctor, my time is just as valuable as hers and it should be respected in the same way. I always show up on time for my appointments, and I expect the same courtesy from my doctor."

The staff is friendy and professional and their equipment is very high tech. I usually have to wait about 15-30 minutes after my appointment time in the waiting room, but I think this might be typical for most doctors offices. Still, this hasn't really stopped me from coming back here. They are extremely helpful and will even refill my routine prescriptions without having to go into the office (which saves me on a co-payment!). I highly recommend her office."
452,Dr. Cynthia McCaleb,Atlanta,Georgia, Internists / Geriatricians , Female,18,3,2012-12-17T23:44:26Z,1.3,1,1,1,2,"I booked Dr. McCaleb's first physical of the day. She was almost an hour late but spent 2 hours with me for the physical. A week after my appointment, I called to check on my results but staff told me that I could only get them if I booked another appointment. I was not informed of this at my first visit, and I didn't have any more time off from work. I just started a new job, so asked if my results could be sent either by fax, email, mail, or over the phone. They refused and said that is not their policy. I said that this policy was never explained to me, and asked for any other way to obtain my results. After three more phone calls over the next month, both the office staff and the doctor herself refused to release my results unless I came in. One office person said: ""If we tell you over the phone, then we won't be able to charge you."" I still have not received my results. Stay away from Dr. McCaleb's office!"
453,Dr. Cynthia McCaleb,Atlanta,Georgia, Internists / Geriatricians , Female,18,3,2012-11-01T14:05:29Z,2.8,2,1,5,3,"Dr MCCaleb is wonderful but as everyone else has noted you will have to wait and wait to actually see her. You will wait at least an hour to see her after your scheduled appointment time. That being said she really does spend a lot of time with her patients making sure to answer all questions. The staff is at best cold and at worst rude and incompetent. I wish some aspects were better, I guess in this healthcare environment you can't get it all ..."
454,Dr. Cynthia McCaleb,Atlanta,Georgia, Internists / Geriatricians , Female,18,3,2012-09-07T12:06:20Z,1.8,2,2,2,1,"The waiting time in this office is around 20 minutes for the nurse to check on your vitals and then 30 minutes inside the room for the doctor to see you. I came to this office with persistent pain in different parts of my body and the doctor was unable to diagnose. She was literally googling on the internet for sympthoms of diferent types of diseases and asking if I had these or that. I could do that by myself at home, save $25 copay and without having to wait 50 min to see a doctor. If you want to be pampered she is great at that but if you want an answer for your illness, she might not be able to give you a solution unless its just a common cold or sore throat. About the staff. I hope this helps. Thanks."

I am prepared to wait for this level of care."

First, she misdiagnosis that I had cataract in my right eye 12/08. She has had a major surgery 12/08 and after that surgery she has not been the same. She has had just one nurse running the office. She is going through a mid-life crisis. Her nurse is overworked and she caters to Dr. McCaleb. Treating Dr. McCaleb like she is a child. I took the Merck prescription form to her office. Three weeks latter, Dr. McCaleb had not signed the form so I could get my prescription free. The nurse never called me back about the cholesterol prescription. She finally got a receptionist in the office and I told her she would not be working for McCaleb long. Dr. McCaleb is slow, late and I feel she needs a much needed rest. Very unprofessional office. She has had a big turnover in staff. It is like pulling teeth to get prescriptions fill. To bad, but this is an accident waiting to happen. I love you and I will pray for you Dr. McCaleb.

He takes his time with you as a patient and is very patient oriented. He will continue to search for your diagnosis and refer you to specialist when needed. If I had not been referred to Dr. Fowler I don't know where I would be today. After 2 surgeries a heart cath and 5 doctors at the age of 30 no one had a clue what was going on. Dr. Fowler on my first visit had an idea of the diagnosis and f/u with test to confirm his suspicions. The surgeries and heart caths were not necessary and the surgery did more harm than good. I can't say enough good things about this Doctor as a MD, and as a person. Even with high case loads he knows you and remembers your diagnosis and is always on your side. He listens to you as a person and a patient and spends the time you need with him. He is one of the rare MD's left that actually cares about his patients and is available whenever they need him. He goes above and beyond for each person & makes your care personal."

All of these qualities are extremely rare as all of you reading this well know! Best of all, my overall condition has improved under her care. I have several chronic conditions that I was told I would have to live with by others. Dr. Pepper has helped me find ways to improve despite the prognosis.

Dr. Pepper's nurse and I had a clear understanding not to do a Cholesterol screening from the blood since it was an afternoon appt. and the results would not be accurate since I had eaten at 10 am that day. The test was done and billed to MY Medicare account anyway. I received a copy of the bloodwork with a very odd letter from Dr. Pepper, prescribing a supplement that my drugstore never received from her, with her suggesting I workout and I am DISABLED and have to walk with a cane!!Yesterday Dr. Pepper sends me a letter registered mail informing me I am no longer a patient. I asked for the Medicare charges on the blood work to be reversed because they were useless test results. Upon calling I find out from Dr. Pepper's nurse she has discredited me to my other doctor in the group and per the nurse I am to be dropped by this doctor too."

He is responsible for saving my life literally 2 times because of his diagnosis. He is very well read and keeps up to date. He will not prescribe drugs he doesn't believe will help you (unlike some Drs who will give you any new drug). He has always been on time with all the tools at Emory to make tests helpful. This is a great doctor and I trust him completely!!!

She is thorough, attentive and professional. The only downside I have is with the office staff. The front desk staff has always been curt and unfriendly. The nurses have been a mixed bag. Sometimes they are personable and attentive while other times they make you feel like you are a bother and are simply going through the motions. The wait to see the doctor is typically long so you must be patient. Once you get to Dr. Kelly you will be glad you waited around."

During the application for individual insurance I discovered there were indications of ""treatment"" for generative joint disease in my file that were in error. These were entered during visits when I saw Dr. Kelly's partner. The office manager was not helpful and Dr. Kelly never contacted me to discuss. During my last visit I showed her the exam file from the insurance company; she could not explain it but she took no action to correct it. A few months previously her partner sent me to the hospital for ""heart"" test when there problems with their EKG machine. The doctor declined when the assistant asked if she should retry it. She said no and sent me to Piedmont. The test was not covered by insurance and cost me over $1000.00. Of course there was nothing wrong. Again the office manager was not helpful and Dr. Kelly's offer was to give the insurance company credit for my next office EKG."

Dr. Deborah Kelly is without a doubt the best doctor I have EVER come across. She was such a pleasure to deal with and sweet. She took time with me and was very humble despite the fact was she voted the State of Georgia's top physician in internal medicine in 2008. I don't see her much, but her other doctors are equally amazing. This is to be expected from a practice that has such an incredible following as Dr. Kelly does."

All appointments were made 30-45 days ahead of time but I still couldn't get in to see her. Always saw her assistant. I was referred to another office where the secretary was also a patient of Dr. Kelly and stated the same thing that she has never seen her in the year and a half that she has been a patient of hers. I would not recommend this doctor to anyone unless you like seeing other people each visit. The one time I did see Dr. Kelly she was friendly but I am looking for a closer relationship with my dr.

This doctor is fairly new but not inexperienced and in general we've gotten along fine. However, I have high cholesterol and the two different medications she prescribed had unacceptable side effects for me. Instead of working through this with me she told me to see a psychiatrist because she had never heard of the side effects I was experiencing, and then to see a cardiologist for my cholesterol. She added that she'd be happy to continue treating my high blood pressure. I'm guessing she was having a bad day but why would I need her to treat my BP if I were to go to a cardiologist? Doctors need to understand that more and more people are aware of the dangers and side effects of drugs and are not willing to put up with them. I hope her day gets better."

I may have to wait for a day or two before I get my results(unless there is a serious issue,if so, tracy calls me when she gets the results)As far as prescriptions are concerned,...she sends them over electronically when you leave the office. I like Dr. Brown. I understand that she is running a small practice on her own,I understand that she is ONE caring for Many.If this does'nt work for you,I say find a new doctor.

I was a patient last year and lost my insurance, but was able to get free medical care due to my hypertension. I was prescribed HCTZ (a diuretic) and it controlled my hypertension well. I regained my insurance this year and decided to choose Dr. Brown again, but couldn't get an immediate appointment. I was out of medication and asked her to call in a prescription for the HCTZ so I wouldn't be without meds until my appointment. She said that she had no way of knowing what medicine I had been prescribed recently and decided to put me on a med SHE chose. My blood pressure got steadily higher the longer I took it. I asked again if she would just call in the HCTZ & was told that I would have to be evaluated in-office first before she would continue prescribing ""all these different medications"". I had only asked for HCTZ. Go figure."

The staff is very nice even when I have been ""not so nice"" when I was sick, they understood that and did not respond nasty in any form or fashion. Dr. Garrity is also NOT a pill pusher she actually tries to help you get to the root of your ailments. **PRICELESS** In my case I had other issues that I was seeing my OBGYN about and she has no problem conferencing my other doctor to inform him of what the course was going to be with all of my issues. I can honestly say that there is no huge wait time in the office. If you show up on time you will be seen at your time. I have experienced a delay on 2 occasions. Once the office realized that there was going to be a delay due to a patient needing immediate care they offered to re-schedule. This was understandable as I have also had to come in for an emergency visit. I love her and the staff and would recomend her to anyone!!!"

He is by far the best dr we have seen. He is clearly smart, but never talks over our heads. He is sympathetic without making us feel pity, and most importantly is the incredibly easy to get in touch with. He has made a difficult situation so much easier, I would send anyone to him and feel confident that they were in excellent hands."

This is a doctor who actually looks at your lab work & xrays after they come back from the lab & radiology. In 2006, he called me personally to tell me he did not feel comfortable with the looks of my recent ""normal"" chest xray and recommended several doctors I could follow up with. End result - lung cancer caught in early stages - had surgery - did not need chemo or radiation and am still alive in 2013. Thank God for Dr. Mellits. His offices & staff are absolutely professional & I especially like one of his nurses ""Sue-Sue"" as she is always wonderful to deal with."

Fitzgerald,Atlanta,Georgia, Internists / Geriatricians , Female,3,4,2009-08-18T14:42:17Z,2,3,3,1,1,"Dr. Fitzgerald overlooked a chronic illness despite my family history, symptoms and self made lab request; she still told me I was fine with a puzzled look as to why I wouldn't believe her. I wasn't and am not still fine, other doctors since have confirmed that my self diagnosis was correct. She's not unkind. But she is detached and under informed. I do not recommend this doctor."

He has been my doctor for 10 years and I'm wouldn't trade him for any other doctor. He does smile, he does talk you, and he IS NOT a robot. He specialty is internal medicine and he is not a shrink. If you want you ego stroked go to a shrink, if you want a superb doctor go to Dr. Carter."

ANTHONY Carter,Atlanta,Georgia, Internists / Geriatricians , Male,11,3.03,2011-09-29T21:24:07Z,1.8,2,3,1,1,"At first the staff had an attitude but then their attitude changed to a more polite one. The waiting time was okay, not anything to show off about. Mr. Carter was hardly helpful and seemed as if he was in a rush. When I asked questions, his responses were basically, ""I do not know."" I was worried that he did not seem to know much or at least try to give me some insight into what I wanted to know. The visit lasted less than five minutes and he was paid about 150-200. I thought since I paid my money, the least he could have done was not try to hurry me as he did. It was as if he could not wait to get me out of his office."

Awful bedside manner. In addition, I asked for a different birth control with the one request that it be something I could get as a generic. He gave me a prescription for meds that do not have a generic. When I called to try and get it fixed, he refused and referred me to an OBGYN. Horrible service. Frustrating to deal with. I DO NOT RECOMMEND."

ANTHONY Carter,Atlanta,Georgia, Internists / Geriatricians , Male,11,3.03,2009-12-02T13:48:27Z,4.8,5,4,5,5,"Dr. Carter does come across as somewhat chilly, but I don't think he's an unfriendly person. He does warm up once he's talking; I just asked him questions about himself, and he's really quite nice. Dr. Carter diagnosed two significant issues for me that other doctors had not, and did it within the space of 10 minutes (at separate times). I moved, but miss him. He was no-muss, no-fuss, no drama, but extremely competent."

ANTHONY Carter,Atlanta,Georgia, Internists / Geriatricians , Male,11,3.03,2009-06-18T14:37:50Z,2,4,2,1,1,After long wait Dr. Carter is in the room only as long as it takes to verify meds and ask if I need refills. Does not respond well to questions. Never smiles. He seems like a robot. His office staff is helpful but nurses not so much. Is supposed to be a specialist of my medical problem but does not seem to know as much about it as I do. I need help and he is not able to give it.
521,Dr. H. ANTHONY Carter,Atlanta,Georgia, Internists / Geriatricians , Male,11,3.03,2008-06-20T19:56:39Z,1.5,3,1,1,1,"The front staff were nice and cheerful. However, his assistant was not. Dr. Carter does not relate to me well Nooo personality....Does not know much about medical issues the website stated were his interests and speciality. Will NOT be going back."

Not a lot of personality - didn't answer any of my questions on multiple visits. Didn't think what he prescribed was the best for me. Stayed in the room about 5 minutes - felt rushed and not attended to. Switched primary care.

Listens, follows through, is reachable, gives explanations, cares about his patients like family. He was my husband's dr. and I changed doctors after I met him; wanted him looking after my health. I've recommended him to people who live in my area."

She stated not to question her, or she would make things difficult or either just keep hanging up on me, not letting me through. I just called to make an appointment with a Dr. I had never seen before! Never said anything to his nurse, just may I make an appointment. Office staff seems to decide who gets to see the dr. He must not have any knowledge of how he staff greats potential new patients. Strangest experience I have ever had trying to make an appointment. Very scarey that he has a medical assistant deciding what goes on in his office without anyone supervising her. Would be too afraid to try this office again because of his staff."

She has been my mom's doctor for years and I had a concern because my mom was not making any sense when she talked to me. Since stroke runs in the family, I called her doctor only to be told that she was old and not to be concerned. I insisted on a brain scan and was refused. When mom got lost driving around Atlanta ( the City she was born in and lived in for 80 years) I was told that the roads change. I again insisted on a brain scan and was told they would do it but wouldn't find anything. Well they did find a cancerous tumor that had metastized from her lung. When I asked about previous chest X-rays I was told she had never had one in the 14 years she had been going to Nan Monahan. I fired this doctor immediately and in my opinion shouldn't be allowed to practice. The tumor has been removed by an amazing team at Piedmont neuro oncology. I would never recommend this practice to anyone."

Major health concerns are minor to Dr. Monahan. Amount of time spent with patients minimal compared to competitive doctors. Never runs on-time or respects patient's time. Horrible phone system always have to leave a message. I will not return."

Just needed to get a routine prescription refilled. My pharmicist made numerous attempts to contact the office as did I. Neither of us received a phone call to explain why they were not refilling the medicine. Consequently, I became very sick when I was unable to continue with my daily meds. Will be changing doctors ASAP. Do they not know the side effects of not taking med? Thought that was why it said to take daily."

During this time she kept treating me for UTIs. Instead of sending me to a Urologist, she treated me over and over -- did she ever read the chart? It turned out I had a kidney stone which blocked the entrance to the kidney, bred infection and had to have my kidney removed because of her blatant neglect. I didn't sue her despite Medical case manager's encouragement, and I should have. I could lose my life because of her neglect."

Told I couldn't come in that day or the next 2 days because Dr. Sams was overbooked. I then asked to come in the 4th day (Friday) and was told she doesn't work on Fridays. I then asked for the following Tuesday and was told she had an early staff meeting and the office would be closing early for the holiday. (Thanksgiving still being 2 days away.) I guess Dr. Sams is not the doctor to have if you are sick, but isn't that the reason you have a doctor in the first place?"

One month later, I needed to see her for a sick appt. Her nurse said I would have to wait 2 months to see the doctor for a new patient appt. The nurse said I should go to an Urgent Care facility or my old doctor to be treated now. So even though Dr. Sams is my doctor of record, I am not allowed to see her until her schedule has an opening for a meet and greet appt. at her convenience. What has happened to the medical profession?"

Dr. Ghayouri is an amazing, very knowledgeable, and respectful doctor. I have been so pleased with my visits that have recommended a number of friends and family members to Dr. Ghayouri. Dr. Ghayouri notified me that she is no longer practicing at her Snellville office through the mail when she was going to continue her practice in Atlanta.

She closed her office and would not answer her phones. When I did get through almost a month later someone else had taken over her practice. I can not get refills now and the doctor that took over her practice says that he does not have her files. If you need good medical attention avoid Dr. Ghayouri. She should stick to weight loss and get out of the medical profession.

She went and talked to the doctor and came back and told me that I was too sick for her to treat. I asked the nurse why the doctor didn't tell me this and what I should do. She said ""Dr. Ghayouri is a little bit unusual."" I asked the nurse what I am supposed to do when I get sick? She said go to the emergency room."

Staff was very rude and unhelpfull, they kept me on hold forever. I inquired about insurance coverage because she was listed with my insurance (Aetna). I was told they did not accept Aetna HMO. I asked her why she was listed as Aetna HMO and she didn't know. I called Aetna and they confirmed she was still current in their system for HMO. When I called her office back, the staff then told me they were not accepting any new patients with Aetna HMO. Aetna said they should have removed their info from the site as it is misleading to patients looking for a new doctor under my plan. She is listed all over the web on different sites accepting Aetna Insurance. Glad I called before assuming I would be covered...can you imagine what kind of bill I would be stuck with for an complete physical? Caveat Emptor!"

I question whether Dr. Bendi even reviewed them. My triglycerides and cholesterol levels were significantly decreased with only a slight elevation remaining and was told the usual diet and exercise recomendation. Should have been told to keep doing what I am doing as everything was greatly improved. Also told I was pre diabetic with a mildly increased glucose 105. Consideration was not taken that my wbc were high and I was under a lot of stress. No critical thinking going on. Very displeased. Will probably find another gp that does not rely on a MA for what should be a RN or MD role."

He refused to see me when I called for an appt. telling me nothing was wrong and I was imagining it. I finally went to the ER where the diagnosis was made. He then accused me of doing it to myself. I later found there were four other people that same week in the Outpatient Infusion Dept who were diagnosed with the same infection, which came from the nurses not properly washing their hands and not using proper sterile technique. I actually had another physician tell me the very least I needed to do was file a complaint with the medical board of GA! Avoid him at all costs."

His daughter works the front and is very unorganized and unhealthful. I have question her about prescriptions and paperwork that needs to be filled out. She knows nothing. She is always busy. The office is in disarray because of her. Papers and files are everywhere. If their is a mistake on a prescription. It take 24 hours for her to call the pharmacy back.

Cancels appointment and reschedules it for his own convenience. Staff is very unhelpful and don’t think your forcefully cancelled appointment is a priority anymore. Hired amateurs to work on their front desk who don’t know how to accommodate any patients. They inform you in the last possible minute that they will need to cancel and reschedule your confirmed appointment. New patients be ware!

Listens very well, and is very respectful; doesn't make assumptions, even if I'm visiting for an ailment I've had before (e.g. sinus infection). He stays current on new research and new meds. Just excellent. I love that he doesn't take appointments. I just go when I'm sick; it's perfect. Everytime my health plan gets changed by my company, I pray he'll still be in my network.

I've used his services for a number of sinus infections and bronchitis/pneumonia issues: bloodwork (CBC) and x-rays were handled in the office. Dr. Kauffman knew which meds worked best for most people against the strains of bug he'd cultured from those with symptoms like mine -- didn't just write ""the usual"". I'm a big fan of the people and have nothing but good things to say about the medicine. One thing to watch: this office handles insurance claims with very few providers. As a result, patients tend to be actually sick, for many pay their own way. It's worth it."

He was an alarmist as well, telling me only worst case scenarios, such as RA or lupus. When I became upset at these possible diagnosis, he wouldn't look me in the eye, just told me to ""sit tight"" and wait on test results due back in a couple of days. I suppose he was in a hurry to rejoin his staff in the hall (outside patients rooms) and get back to making fun of a previous patient.

Dr. Ou has studied many, many different medical treatments and philosophies, moreso than any other doctor I have seen. However, for all his knowledge, he is not effective. I was under his care for months and I got sicker and sicker to the point that it became difficult for me to work. He understood that I was getting worse, but he did not change his approach AT ALL. Isn't that the definition of insanity? Doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result? Dr. Ou relies almost entirely on autonomic response testing (a form of muscle testing) and only barely considers other data such as lab results. Once he looks at your labs, he will test substances with ART and say that even though your labs show that you need thyroid medicine, etc., that your body says it doesn't want it. Even once I was feeling really terrible, he did not order lab work to check my hormones, digestion, or anything else. He was so focused on his existing philosophy (using ART) that he couldn't see the forest for the trees: at some point, you have to help people treat their symptoms so they can function in life, even if you want to continue looking for the ""root cause"" of their illness. After I left Dr. Ou, I went back to my previous doctor who relies on labwork, and I started feeling better within a few months. It wasn't rocket science. "

He is pleasant and focused on the patient as a whole person to treat the cause of illness, not just the laundry list of symptoms.

He does not treat the body as a whole. At the end of the day, I don't think I would have ever gotten better if I continued to see him. My adrenals were fried, my thyroid was functioning very poorly, I was full of heavy metals and had multiple infections and viriuses. He does not order any labs, and totally relies on autonomic response testing. You have to treat the body and all the systems if one wants to beat this disease, My adrenals, thyroid, hormones and heavy metals were never addressed, and I actually felt myself getting worse."

He was very unfriendly and condescending to my concerns. He said I probably have Lyme Disease or have mold in my house which was causing my symptoms because he basically couldn't figure out what was wrong with me. I wanted to try a holistic approach because I wanted to try and treat my illness with a so called healthier approach. I found him to be very annoyed when I asked him questions. He was trying to diagnose me with a very vague illness and he got defensive just because I was having trouble understanding what the heck he was talking about. I am an intelligent and very patient person but I even felt disregarded and disrespected. He actually said to me one visit when I asked him how much time I had left, ""well I'm charging by the minute so you might as well go ahead."" Thankfully I have found some very compassionate and understanding doctors who have helped me tremendously. I highly discourage you to see Dr. Ou."

One nurse took my blood pressure wrong and had it elevated and when I told her that I was surprised because it usually ran low, she checked it, and in fact it was low which she lowered my BP meds. Also a nurse called me and referred me to an orthopedic surgeon because my x-rays from Northside Hospital showed a fracture. When I picked up the x-rays from hospital and report from Dr.'s office, it showed no fracture. No so trusting of the staff.

In fact, her office was using faulty equipment (which the office manager later admitted to me), thereby getting false positives on many of their patients. In addition, Dr. Varner overstated my weight by 13 lbs. (11% of my total weight) on the Physician's Form from my insurance company. Note that Dr. Varner cannot handle any medical or administrative concerns that she views as criticism. If you express any, however nicely, she will probably discharge you from her medical practice."

He is completely compassionate, helpful and trustworthy. Any time I have been concerned he always asks questions to get to the heart of the matter. He is very thorough. He has kept up with my life (started as his patient in College, now married with children about to hit middle age). He makes it a point to really check on me at each visit. He 100% cares about his patients. My husband now goes to him too. He is clearly a very intelligent doctor—when he is listening to you he listens very intently and thinks about what you are telling him before he responds. So maybe for the patients that feel like he is rude there is a misconception about his thought process —a few seconds of quiet may make him seem aloof but pay close attention and you will notice he is taking in all the information and making an informed response that is in your best interest. I completely recommend him."

I am a diabetic & also have hypothyroidism, both of which need to be carefully monitored & frequently checked. During each visit, the 1st thing he would ask me was ""and what are we going to do about your diabetes?"" Never checked my feet which is one thing a pcp must do with a diabetic patient! I kept trying to get him to pay attention to my thyroid issues since I had no energy, my hair was falling out & my mind fogged up frequently,but he said that the dosage was correct for my bloodwork results. Since I am now under under other care, I found out that my thyroid dose was too high & that it precipitated a hyperthyroid state. Current endocrinologist diagnosed this by performing 2 simple tests in her office--bending over to touch toes & checking knee & elbow reflexes, which were almost totally absent (Maxa never checked either). The last time I was there, the PA informed me that I was 2 weeks too early for my Medicare physical, which his office had called & scheduled & did I want to see Maxa that day? It ended up being one of those ""wellness"" visits to discuss issues, though they took blood & charged my Medicare $600 for the privilege & Maxa's 10 min unpleasant comments. A true incompetentwho has no business treating either diabetics or thyroid patients. He can't even interpret lab results!!

Knowing myself the delicate nature and strict monitoring of the blood thinning medication, I asked Dr Maxa flat out if there were any known interactions with the crestor and the Warfarin, he said no. Within a few days I woke up bleeding from my gums profusely and had to go to the emergency room; it looked as if I had been chewing glass, blood all over my pillow and leaking from my gums. It turns out that one of the biggest cautions with crestor is to not take along with Warfarin due to its increasing effect on the drugs thinning properties. My blood became too dangerously thin. I tried my best to deal with this via the management of the Doctors offices but they gave me the run-around and would not take a meeting or discuss the matter any further. The $600+ I mentioned above was the out of pocket costs I had to pay for the emergency care I received."

Smug, not open to discussion, made lots of errors in charting and interpreting tests. Relies on inadequately trained med assistants to take history and does not cross check herself. Fails to focus on main areas of concern, ordered unnecessary testing which she then could not interpret correctly. Attempted to insist I see her specialist friends rather than specialists with whom I already had relationships. "

Caring, compassionate, thorough, looks at the whole person, not just a specific medical issue. Returns many of her own calls and is lightening quick with email responses. I wouldn't trade her for the world!"
614,Dr. Robin R. Pyburn,Atlanta,Georgia, Internists / Geriatricians , Female,5,3,2014-07-18T16:58:31Z,2,5,1,1,1,"BAD. She didn't listen. She re-input ALL the info her nurse collected, wasting 30+min. She missed several things, including part of the exam I specifically requested. She forgot to order the breathing test to her staff, so they kept cleaning up her mistakes while apologizing profusely. She kept me waiting 2 hours in the exam room to accommodate the late patient in the next room (I can hear you in the hallway, ma'am). She asked me if I wanted a chest X-Ray??? You tell me, doc. She told me I had wax in my ear, yet rather than simply remove it with a tool she said she'd refer me to an ENT. I expressed my desire to leave, she became hostile, lectured me that this wasn't a good fit (apparently because I'm under 60), and turned on her heels and left the room. I never received the medication I needed to get well. She is a ""CYA"" doctor, not truly concerned with getting you better. She's an obvious ageist. Time to retire. Proceed with caution!"

Pyburn,Atlanta,Georgia, Internists / Geriatricians , Female,5,3,2012-05-20T17:17:58Z,4.8,4,5,5,5,"I'm not sure what happened with the other reviewer, but I have to say I have NEVER had a doctor as thorough and professional as Dr. Pyburn. It takes a while to get in to see her, but that's because she actually takes her time with you (how refreshing!) and when she's in the room with you you feel like you're her only patient that day! She's amazing, and I'm so happy I found her."
616,Dr. Robin R. Pyburn,Atlanta,Georgia, Internists / Geriatricians , Female,5,3,2011-10-29T05:58:19Z,2,1,2,4,1,"Overall very unsatisfactory. Failed to record accurate history of main problem and did nothing to address serious condition...a dangerous situation. Instead, ordered series of tests for problems I didn't have, then misinterpreted them. Had poorly trained medical asst. call me to say tests abnormal so I need invasive orocedures. Checked in w specialist who said tests nornal!! Then her office staff calls to say tests actually OK. Not a mixup. She ordered labs she didn't understand. She diagnosed second problem incorrectly, saw specialist who was very competent, made correct diagnosis. That happens.....specialists have more training. But what's not OK is Dr. Pyburn contradicting specialist, again insisting tests need to be done that specist said were not indicated without explaining herself. When I said would go by what specialist said, she became hostile. My chart had diagnoses listed which I didn't have bec MD relies on unqualified asst to take history. Front office staff rude."

Dr. Mehul Tejani, MD shares a practice with several other doctor's in the GRADY building in ATLANTA. Dr. Mehul Tejani, MD was very thorough when discussing my past medical history, and I never once felt like I was being rushed so that he could get to another patient. Everyone on staff like Dr. Vashnavi N. Kundel, MD also my Primary Care Physician, appeared to be very personable and organized very organized. The only negative I have is that I had to schedule a Ambulatory referral to Neurology three months in advance because she booked it for me.

He takes his time and speaks with you in a caring way. He will give you as much time as you need without rushing! I went in with some emotional issues with my physical and he looked at the situation holistically-- mind and body. He explained his treatment plan and i felt very at ease. I felt so much better after we spoke. You can tell him anything and he is nonjudgmental. He is the best. That is why he stays booked up. :-)

When our mother was in hospital as his patient, EVERY doc and nurse in E.R. and on floor commented that hey was their favorite. Doesn't have the Doc ego - several commented they've seen him help wheel patients in chairs and gurneys and continues to be a professional who is humble. He is thorough, accurate, and probably most importantly, human. A rare breed, ratings don't go nearly high enough to adequately express how good he is. Staff is equally warm, caring and passionate.

He did an echocardiogram at St. Mary's Hospital in Athens, which revealed a small 1-2 mm hole in the septum of her heart. He came back to the maternity ward on a Sunday (his off-day) to explain the situation and prognosis, drawing pictures for us to illustrate the problem and explain that he wasn't really very concerned because it is a problem that usually heals on its own. He was very reassuring and personable. We were really impressed. Even though his main office is a little out of the way for us, we will likely go back to him when she needs her follow-up exam at six weeks. Note: we didn't deal with his staff at all, but there's not a N/A choice on the Staff question above."

I called and they put you on wait for over 30 min. Also they have the MOST ANNOYING mensages playing while you wait. I just moved to GA and I had Dr. April as a referral. I gave up waiting at the first try. Later I tried again, on the message they play while you wait for a lonnnngo time, said I was the call number 1 and it took so longo to answer, I even wander if thers was anyone actually answer phone calls at all. Then when they finally answer me, she asked which day I wanted. I asked for the first day available, she said on Tuesday , that day I coukd, so I asked for Wednesday. She said, dr. April is hete only on Tuesdays. (So why did she asked me at first ""which day I wanted"", she should start saying that then) So, I asked for any day in September. She answered me: I will let you figure out your agenda first, then I will talk to you again. I hang up. I don't want have to deal with a place of this level."

I waited 2 hrs (one hour in the waiting room and one hour in those backwards robes) to see Dr Shah. No apology or explantion as to why I had to wait 2 hours for a general check up. Dr Shah then insisted I change my medication (that I had been on for 6 years without a problem). This medication change lead to major side effects and I went to a different Dr who said there was nothing wrong with my original medication. Dr Shah is by far the worst Doctor I have seen. Her bedside manners and inability to communicate leaves something to be desired.

I got an appointment for a physical that was more than a month out. On the day of the appointment I showed up on time and had my paperwork completed prior to the set time. I then waited over an hour without being seen.
After an hour I voiced my disapproval with the front desk at being untimely and was given attitude about it. I asked why they couldn't call me and ask me to show up whenever the doctor would be ready if they were behind schedule and I was given a blank stare. I left at that point without getting the physical.
I would NOT recommend this doctor unless you like waiting inordinate amounts of time for no reason."

He was booked, but I was 'squeezed' in with an appointment that week. He came into the exam room and I briefly explained my sypmtoms. He asked when I could be available for a Brochoscopy. He said he could do it tomorrow and I said I could as well. He briefly told me what this would entail, and left the room. He was with me a total of 5 or 6 minutes at the most. He never examined me in any way. I was billed close to $550 dollars for the office visit, exam, etc. I was not happy. I called his office 3 times to follow up on test results from the procedure. I never got a person, only voicemail. No one ever returned my calls. I ended up in the hospital a few weeks later. After I was released, I found that one of the insurance claims was for him for a hospital visit. I never saw him in the hospital. He is overpriced and under qualified in my opinion."

There is no excuse for any sick patients to wait 4 hours before seeing the doctor. You can be seen faster at the emergency. Staff turn over is high. I would not recommend the practice to my worst enemy. I walked out feeling as if I was at a clinic with no insurance. The Buckhead facility is ran totally different from the snapfinger location. The wait time is about 30 minutes verses 4 hours. I personally feel the patient personal time is not valued by Dr. Walker .

Well It started at the door. My appointment was at 09:15 and I got to the triage area around 1005. Once I was donr there I had an ekg done and then I was placed in a office to wait to see the Dr. I waited until 1055 before I asked a lady in one of the offices to check on the hold up, and was told someone would be in to check on me in a minute. Well by 1120 Noone had been i n to check on me so I went out again and spoke to a nurse who really didnt seem too concerned with my issue. Well I stepped out to use the restroom and came right back not even 3 minutes and the doctor was in with a patient who arrived after I did, and stayed in there with her for another 30 minutes. Needless to say, It was not very clean and well maintained. I left this office at 0115 pm with a referral and a headache. Her staff needs to learn etiquette, and the Dr needs to learn time management."

They are so grossly incompetent it stuns me. A patient could die waiting on them to handle even the simplest of requests.

Never disagree, or ask a question because he'll probably just stare at you like you don't need to know. He's rude and just wants you out of his
office. Rudest provider I have ever had the bad luck to get trapped in a little room with. I've seen many real physicians and I would have to say that he is the least caring, most intimidating one that I have had the misfortune to get stuck with. If you see his name on your chart, do yourself a favor and just leave. He doesn't care as long as you pay your bill. Go anywhere else as fast as you can."

Very cocky, condesending, and I wouldn't have a physical exam by him again. I have never in my life had a prostate exam hurt which I believe was purposeful. The office staf certainly fit the bill of being rude - especially the office manager. When I decided to leave this practice and get my medical records she would not answer a direct question. They treat every patient as being beneath them in this practice. Most had no idea I am a nurse and former hospital CEO. I must say that the head of the group took my letter of complaint seriously but I would never go back to this practice which is housed within Crawford, now part of Emory - just as bad as Dr. Jones"

He found this doctor who accepts our insurance that was close to where he lives. After a 60 minute wait he was given numerous blood tests, etc. that I feel were not needed and they wanted him to come back which I advised him not to do. This was not his first sinus infection and he felt that he knew what was going on. He left with a low dose antibiotic prescription which didn't work. He is now coming home to our regular doctor. He was charged $850 for a sinus infection diagnosis. I feel that my son was taken advantage of by someone he went to that he felt he could trust. Shame on any doctor or other adult who takes advantage of our young people or anyone else. And we try our best to teach them to do right and believe, respect and trust their elders.

I was there for a physical which turned into a 4 to 5 day process. I had to be called back into the office to have a test done that was forgotten on my initial day there. second with the completion of physical I needed a form filled out at which she charged me 75.00 before she would give it to me. Not only did they bill my insurance to the Max; she also wanted more money. This was a horrible experience I hope no one else has to experience.

However, Dr. Kathy Minter is horrible and hurt my health a great deal, permanently.When she prescribed Mobic pills for arthritis, she refused to warn about side-effects. The Mobic caused permanent heartburn, so that I can't sleep well at night. Then for the heartburn (she caused), she said to take Prevacid pills ""forever,"" even though the bottle says to take them for just 2 weeks. When I asked her about this, she said not to worry about those directions, and that Prevacid also has no side effects. However, now I have permanent liver damage! When I started to directly ask her ""Does this medicine cause side effects?"", she said ""No"" and even got mad. So Dr. Minter hurt the quality and length of my life. Also, Doctor Minter kept trying to treat a stomach bacteria herself (h pylori, that the heartburn made worse), which was a waste of my time and money. Finally, I went to a gastroenterologist, a stomach specialist, who did cure the bacteria."

She has been my PCM for the last 4.5 years and when I moved from the area I continued to travel the distance to see her for my medical problems.

I myself think she is money hungry. She is not thorough and does not do prevention medicine. She does not make an effort or is concerned with your pain problems or make suggestions. She does not take the time to get to know her patients. To see her you wait about 2 hours even with an appointment and then when you finally do see her, she rushes you out because it close to closing time especially when your appointment is in the afternoon."

I was referred to Dr. Critelli for blood in my bowel movements. She had me do a colonoscopy which she was 3 hours late for. After insisting on a colonoscopy she did not even do a thorough job. She stated matter of factly that hemherroids were the problem and I was referred to a colo-rectal surgeon. The surgeon took one look and said the problems was not hemherroids at all but a fissure with abnormal scar tissue around it. She said if Dr. Critelli had been even remotely thorough during the colonoscopy she would have caught this. Therefore, I had a colonoscopy for nothing."

My initial visit with Dr. Kaufmann was very pleasant and as a result I was given a few ""new"" perscriptions as well as a referral for an MRI to try to figure out what was ailing me. However, since that initial visit I have been back to the office twice and both times eventhough I insisted and was assured that I would be meeting with the Doctor himself, I was instead visited by a female intern or perhaps she is also a Doctor, but she is definitely not the person who I signed up to see in this office. In subsequent phone calls I have asked very politely to be called by Dr, Kaufmann to discuss with him the best, next course of tests that can be done since after 9 months now my issues are not improving, if not getting worse. I normally don't like saying anything bad about anyone, but after so much effort on my part to just be able to speak with the Doctor whose name is on the door of this office, and now after three very clear occurances where MRI or medical results were confirmed sent to their office yet they told me that they never received them, I can only with a clear conscence suggest to anyone who is looking for a new doctor to stay away from this practice, office, and Doctor."

I cannot say enough of the excellent level of care, understanding, concern and expertise that he has provided for myself, my family and numerous friends (whom I've referred and are now long-time patients as well). I came to RateMD.com to look up an ENT for my mom & was dismayed with the reviews I read here about Dr. K, so I wanted to let everyone out there know: that for those SIX bad reviews on here, there are literally thousands of us that LOVE Dr. Kaufmann & his staff (at Atlanta & Woodstock offices). Sure, I've had to wait (who hasn't for a Dr.), but 95&#037; of the time that's not the case. You get what you wait for-and what you get is the BEST Internist in Atlanta. He is a busy man...of that there is no doubt, but time spent with you doesn't equal QUALITY. He referred you to a specialist in 2 min? GO! He saved my mother's(cancer) & my best friend's lives (brain tumor) by referrals to the best Docs in ATL. I'll never go anywhere else!"

I do not recommend this doctor for anyone. I had to wait for almost 20 minutes in a small room where a nurse took my pressure and asked some questions before this doctor came in. Then spent like 2 minutes and he told me that I needed to go to a specialist. The really bad thing Is that the appointment was like 3 weeks ago and I am still waiting for the specialist referral. I have called several times to the clinic to ask about it and either the referral coordinator is busy or they tell me that they are going to work on it. Zero points to this doctor and this clinic.

He acted like someone who was either mentally ill or under the influence of something. I can't think of any reason for his behavior. He went completely contrary to accepted medical knowledge. His behavior was bizarre. I would not recommend this place to anyone. His attitude permeates the office. A member of his staff kept me waiting too long, so I left. Later, I received an angry, rude message on my answering machine. Very menacing. I hope they don't think they scare anyone. The theme of this office is rudeness. The front desk staff yells at patients. I wish I would have left when I first saw how the staff behaved, and spared myself a horrible experience with this doctor."

I do not know what this woman's problem is but these past 2 visits she has been very cold, curt, rushes the visits, does not listen very well, and is just downright rude. Mind you I was driving from Alabama to see this woman. I cannot stress enough to other Wegener's/Vasculitis patients to PLEASE do your research on these doctors before going to them. Dr.Lipson turned out to be exactly like the nasty rheumatologist I was seeing before her.
You can tell the content of a person's character by how they act and treat people especially sick people. Don't bother filing a complaint with patient relations (or nurse manager Jessica Martin) because they just side with the doctor thinking the doctor knows best and will terminate you as a patient. If you do beware of Allison Brown who will talk about you and your complaint to others in the department. My issue with ""Doctor"" Lipson is the fact I asked her at the 3rd visit with her a month after having Rituxan infusions if I could be on cell cept as a maintenance. I asked because I know my body and I know when I flare. When I first did Rituxan in Jan.2015 afterward I was put on Imuran. 4 months later I flared.
Inflammation attacked my eye again. Last year the awful rheumy I was seeing refused to put me on a maintenance medication along with Rituxan and 4 months later the Wegener's attacked my joints and I could not walk and had joint swelling. I did not want a repeat of that happening. Lipson's treatment plan of Imuran and prednisone didn't work either. I asked Lipson to be on cell cept, she said no, and later said it was too early. Sure enough 4 months later I flare. Actually in May I started having awful respiratory symptoms of shortness of breath. Come June I started having sinus drainage and stuffiness, face pain, ear pain, weakness, feeling bone tired, joint pain, etc. The ER doctor twice diagnosed me with Sinusitis which Wegener's can cause. I went to my pcp and she saw how bad off I was and wanted me to get in with Lipson ASAP.
I see Lipson and I am still sick and walking with a limp. Lipson could not have cared less and was rude, dismissive, seemed annoyed, would not listen, kept interrupting me when I talked, and let out annoyed sighs. She finally shook her head, rolled her eyes, and said I could try cell cept which she ended up not putting me on. As she was getting up to leave I asked her if she would prescribe anything for my pain and she said no and that rheumatology does not prescribe narcotics. Which is a lie because another patient with Wegener's that goes there get's them from her rheumy. She did not prescribe any anti-inflammatory meds or made no suggestions as to what to do about my pain. She just walked out of the room and scheduled me to come back 2 months later. Knowing how painful and nasty Wegener's is. I ended up having a full blown flare in both of my eyes 2 weeks later.
After that I found a rheumatologist closer to me. I tried 3 times to speak with Jessica Martin the manager over the department and she was no help and actually kept blowing me off. In fact I received an email from Abbey W in patient relations letting me know Jessica and Lipson were terminating me as a patient while I was in a flare and on no treatment. The doctor I currently see actually listened and said Rituxan alone is not enough for me and put me on 25mg of methotrexate and wants me to continue Rituxan infusions.
DO NOT waste your time with Aliza Lipson and beware of trolls on here that will highly rate her out of the blue. Look at the reviews on healthgrades about her and they say the same thing I have wrote about her rude behavior and lack of care. It's a shame because the first 2 visits with her were awesome. She had excellent bedside manners then but by the 3rd it went downhill and didn't get better. When a doctor refuses to listen to you and come up with a treatment plan that will help you then run as fast as you can from them."

Dr. Nesmith ignored my mother's complaints and told her just to add orange juice while taking her iron pills. She told me my mother's bloodwork was normal. I ended up taking my mother to the E.

Finally I ended up taking my mother to the E.R. and she was diagnosed with colon cancer. She had a tumor that was 3.7 centimeters in size. How was that not found? She is married to a G. I. dr. Never referred her. 2 months later my mother died a suffering death. She did not deserve that. If you want to be misdiagnosed go to Dr. Elizabeth Nesmith. She will take your life in her hands. "

The doctor's demeanor from the start was arrogant and dismissive. My husband said he knew from the second she entered the exam room that things were not going to go well. And they didn't. It was a dreadful! The doctor had a diagnosis in her head almost immediately, though she had not looked at my records or test results! Any symptoms that didn't match her diagnosis, she simply ignored. She was rude to the point of you wondered why she was even there? She was so abrupt that we felt almost thrown out the door--but with orders for a long list of expensive lab tests that had already been done (in some cases, repeatedly), which she would have known, had she looked at the copies her staff had made of my records! We decided against going through with the lab tests, informed her staff and then left, feeling much worse than we did when we first arrived. The whole awful experience actually gave me nightmares that night! Not what you want from a doctor!!!"

My experience with Dr. Mepani was stressful. She stays in rush mode . Under pressure she's combative and rude. Although my stomach pain was worsening, she told her assistant I should keep doing what I'm doing. Dr. Mepani didn't know what I was taking.
Before my colonoscopy/endoscopy procedures, I was laying on the table receiving anesthesia. She shoved some papers in my hand to sign. Her explanation was my intestines could rip. Her tone was abrasive. I was so uncomfortable that I wanted to cancel the procedures. After signing the documents, she snatched them from my hand before I could add the time. After waking up from the procedures, I had sharp chest and throat pains. I could barely talk. She was too rough with the tool during the endoscopy. I was in the ER the next day. (Two days before my business trip) A CT Scan and X-Rays were taken. Although she was informed of my ER visit, she didn't call or offer help. No diagnosis was ever given for my stomach pain. I invested time and a lot of money and received no helpful results. I would recommend Dr. Rachel Mepani to No One."

Sat with back to me inputing duplicate m h. Even though I presented Rx and mr for c cap dated 1/11/14, insisted I go have testing done over at another facility and incurred copays again. Duplicity unwarranted, time lapse they expect for that referral would get authorized IS NOT AN INCONVENIENCE BUT DETRIMENTAL TO MY HEALTH!!! ITS. CALLED AN EXACERBATION OF A KNOWN MEDICAL CONDITION. AND IN MY CASE ELDER ABUSE CONSIDERINGMY OTHER Dx. Dropping them like a hot potato while filing complaint with state insurance commissioner,kaiser and Medicare Quality Review.

He has recently converted to a ""concierge"" practice, so be prepared to spend $1500/year to see him, but if you have the money, he is worth it. The entire practice is professional.

His nurse started my experience out with being rude and uncaring to me. He came in and was uncaring about my pain and he said all I needed to do was exercise and that nothing was wrong with me. They mocked me and harassed me. Worse experience I have ever had. Save your time and go to a better doctor.

If she comes into either your or your loved one's hospital room, immediately request a different physician take over the care. She should not be practicing medicine.

If she happens to be your hospitalist; ask for a new doctor immediately. She assumed that I did not know my rights and told me that I could not ask for another doctor. If she does not know, she will not ask her constituents. She knows everything, even if it causes you harm. Beware! She left me in tears because I was in so much pain and she refused to listen. She knows EVERYTHING which in essence means you know nothing beneficial to the patient. You will suffer at her hands."
