We were patients of the Paynes and met her during an emergency visit for an asthma attack. My son ended up at the ER and she continually called to check on him, came by while we were in the waiting room and called the next day. VERY DEDICATED! We live in Katy and drive all the way to the medical center just to see her. In fact, everytime we go to Walgreens my son asks when he gets to see ""dr baker"". We are expecting another child in March and won't ever consider using anyone else....definitely worth the drive!"
6,Dr. Rachel H. Baker,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,18,4.75,2011-03-27T09:27:59Z,4.8,5,4,5,5,"We too had gone to Dr. Payne for years and felt our children received the best care. Dr. Baker has filled some pretty big shoes with her own style, youthful enthusiasm and love for taking care of children. Our children are now high school and college aged and you should be happy to know that Dr. Baker is as engaged with them and their physical and mental wellbeing as she is for the babies and new mothers she treats. My daughter wishes Dr. Baker could be her doctor through adulthood! She is great."

Really don't even think twice, she's the best !! Returns calls 24*7, advises what's the best option, calms us down as we are always worried about our little one :) You could end up waiting a little but that's very normal with a pediatrician !"
14,Dr. Sheri L. Mitchell,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,11,4.84,2013-08-31T14:43:33Z,5,5,5,5,5,"She is the absolute best DR.

My first visit with her for my 1st child, which was 15 yrs ago, was fantastic. I was instantly drawn to her personality. She remembers the patient's name as well as any nicknames that you may have for them. More doctors need to call and ask her how to provide 5-star service."
16,Dr. Sheri L. Mitchell,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,11,4.84,2012-03-07T10:59:12Z,4.8,5,4,5,5,We have been visiting Dr. Mitchell for only a year but even in our first visit she was an instant favorite with my boys and me. She is casual but knowledgeable the kind of doctor that can tell you like it is with out hurting feelings.
17,Dr. Sheri L. Mitchell,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,11,4.84,2010-12-16T09:27:37Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Sheri Mithcell has been a hugh blessing to my family. She has been my children pediatrician for almost 12 years now. I have one child that has grown out of asthma, and another one that still deals with it. She always has the right solution for care, and also to put my worrying mind at peace. I love the connection that she has with her patients which she calls her children. I love that she takes an interest in their mental well-being as well as physical. I travel far to see her because I know that my children are in wonderful hands when they are being cared by her. I have recommended her to all of my family and friends. As long as she's a doctor of pediatrics, we will be her patients until my children become too old."
18,Dr. Sheri L. Mitchell,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,11,4.84,2009-01-17T04:32:55Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Mitchell has been my kids dr for over 15 years I have twins boys and of course I was a total wreck when I had them. She was very reassuring to both me and my husband. We could reach her at anything, get a call back pronto, and I would feel better after that one phone call. Whenever they visit her she question them about grades, sports, etc. So she's not only concern with thier physical well being she also like to know how they are during overall. I would recommend her without any reservation to any parent. She is very knowlegeable and has excellent bedside manners. ps she continues to make my twins laugh today because she can not tell them apart after 15 years."
19,Dr. Sheri L. Mitchell,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,11,4.84,2008-12-01T02:07:41Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Mitchell is top-notched in her field. She goes well above the call of duty in dealing with families with special needs toddlers/infants. She is compassionate, empathetic and is truly dedicated to her profession -pediatrics. My grand-daughter was born with a large hole in every chamber of her heart. Dr. Mitchel worked with the family before, during and after my grand-daughter's surgery to ensure her breathing and nutritional needs were not compromised. The other doctors speak highly of her, especially at Texas Children's Hospital. I highly recommend her"
20,Dr. Jan K Davis,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,9,4.86,2014-01-16T17:29:36Z,5,5,5,5,5,"I saw the good reviews and decided to choose Jan as our Pediatrician after our baby was born 7 days ago. It was a great experience the whole way. The gentleman at the desk was very nice and professional, the nurse was sweet and the Dr. was very generous with her time and easy to talk with. We were assigned another pediatrician by the hospital where their staff never greeted us, didn't say a word to us as they walked us to our room and the Doctor was not nearly as thorough. It was only our first visit but I really liked what we saw."
21,Dr. Jan K Davis,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,9,4.86,2012-09-05T01:52:00Z,4.8,5,4,5,5,Dr. Davis is so kind and knows her stuff. Why can't every doctor be like this? She returns phone calls and we never feel rushed. Appointments are easy to make and I wouldn't go anywhere else. If bedside manners matter to you then she is your doctor. Thanks Dr. Davis!
22,Dr. Jan K Davis,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,9,4.86,2012-05-18T08:30:49Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Jan Davis is a wonderful pediatrician! Her knowledge and gentle demeanor are amazing. My husband and I are first time parents and must have asked her a million questions at all times of the day and night and she was always patient, kind and helpful - even at 3:00am! I've never encountered another physician with a better bedside manner. If you want the best for your child I highly recommend Dr. Jan Davis."
23,Dr. Jan K Davis,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,9,4.86,2012-03-08T04:33:02Z,4.8,5,4,5,5,Dr. Davis is friendly and great with getting back to you and answering questions. Her nurse Jani is also great! I'm glad we choose them for our child's care. They are knowledgeable and caring and professional and just plain what you wish every doctor and nurse would be like.
24,Dr. Jan K Davis,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,9,4.86,2011-05-07T22:12:55Z,5,5,5,5,5,"What I really like about Dr. Davis is even when I talk to her about whatever, she never took her eyes away from my child. She constantly observes him to see how he acted and progressed during the whole time we were in her office. Very knowledgeable and caring doctor, and the same goes to her nurse, Jani."
25,Dr. Jan K Davis,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,9,4.86,2011-03-14T14:44:30Z,4.8,4,5,5,5,"Dr. Davis is awesome and so is her husband, Rick, when he works the front desk. We love her since we brought our first child to her and we now have 4. She is patient, kind, professional, and a great listener. And most importantly her approach to medicine is clear and logical. We love her and we have driven over 30 min since we moved and paid in cash to keep seeing her."
26,Dr. Jan K Davis,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,9,4.86,2010-10-18T14:11:28Z,4.5,4,4,5,5,"Dr. Davis is a great pediatrician. She sincerely cares about kids and you never feel like a number to her; she is never rushing out the door - when she's with you, she's focused on you until she's sure you don't have more questions. She is also willing to work with us to modify our son's vaccination schedule, although she also made it clear that she strongly recommended that we get all of them done. And when you call on weekends you talk to her or her nurse - folks who know your child, not a service at a hospital somewhere. I am very happy we chose her as our Dr."
27,Dr. Jan K Davis,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,9,4.86,2008-10-07T10:38:30Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Very helpful staff. Down to earth. I am always able to make an appointment when I want, on the day I want. The nurse is super friendly, as is Dr. Davis herself. And, you can't beat that Dr. Davis answers her own calls after hours. In an emergency, I want to be able to get to the doctor quickly, and I know I can with Dr. Davis."
28,Dr. Jan K Davis,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,9,4.86,2008-07-29T20:37:38Z,5,5,5,5,5,"I can always get an appointment with Dr. Davis on the same day I call. Her practice is small, with only one nurse and herself. Dr. Davis and her nurse, Jani have really made an effort to get to know my children as people. They have a no-nonsense approach to medical care. They are straightforward with the kids, explaining why they are doing certain procedures, but they do it with care. Any time of day or night, someone answers the phone. Dr. Davis, herself takes calls in the middle of the night...not an answering service. I cannot say enough good things about the practice. Nothing about the office is fancy or swanky. In fact, they do all their record keeping by hand, with limited computer use. This is the kind of doctor's office you went to when you were a kid."
29,Dr. Nava Miller,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,13,4.52,2016-11-13T05:51:21.816Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr Miller is the best! She really takesthe time to listen. I love coming to her practice, we highly recommend her. "
30,Dr. Nava Miller,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,13,4.52,2016-03-23T20:45:51.382Z,4.8,5,4,5,5,"My both daughters have been patients of Dr. Nava Miller. She always gives the right advice. Every time we consulted with someone else and then went to Dr. Miller to reconfirm, she'd give us the more simple and effective solution. She also does not hesitate to refer you to a specialist if it is needed. Trusted and experienced doctor!"
31,Dr. Nava Miller,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,13,4.52,2016-03-01T22:58:21.870Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Nava has been seeing my family for over 10 years now.

She is thorough and always gives my son 100 % attention. She is good about follow-up and asks me if there is anything else i have questions about. She's sympathetic and encouraging as this is my first child. She's a God send. Also, she's booked most times so i take my son's appointments very seriously. "

I have 2 little boys one born with a disease she has never ran across in an infant before. However she has gone out of her way to become knowledgable and helpful. She is not just a doctor but a friend!!!
37,Dr. Nava Miller,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,13,4.52,2010-03-02T21:19:05Z,3.3,1,4,4,4,"We had our baby at The Women's Hospital but did not live nearby so were given Dr. Miller as our pediatrician. She was very punctual every morning as our daughter had jaundice and had to stay in the hospital a little longer than normal. We had to visit her office the day after she was released just to make sure she was over it, and that's where we had problems. She was going so fast in the office; jumping from one thing to another. She actually left in the middle of examining our daughter to take a phone call in the hallway. I thought that was very unprofessional. Then on the way out, one of her staff members continued to have a private conversation while I was just standing there with my newborn asking several times if we were done yet. There are many good pediatricians in Houston. I was not that impressed with Dr. Miller. I'm sure you can find better (we did but he's on the opposite side of town)."
38,Dr. Nava Miller,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,13,4.52,2008-07-11T21:04:13Z,4.5,4,4,5,5,she makes a point to know each child's name and talk to them because they are the ones that are her patients. Very informative and open to talk and answer questions. Both of my children LOVE her!

40,Dr. Sonia Chauhan,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,22,4.4,2017-09-19T02:27:07.346Z,3,2,3,3,4,"Be expected to talk to her interns before you speak to her. It does get frustrating having to repeat your concerns with the attending nurse, then her interns, then finally with Dr. Chauhan. You witness her mini lesson and see if her interns messed up on their ""diagnosis."" I understand everyone needs to learn but sometimes busy moms just need to talk to the doctor immediately. I noticed a huge change in the staffs attitude lately, it doesn't hurt to smile. However, Ashley at the front desk, always has a great attitude! "

We used to live a few miles from her practice. We decided to stay with her even when the commute to her office could be an hour. The care worth it."

No or little waiting time and kind/friendly staffs. I can see and feel that Dr. Hoefner truly concerns about my girl and provides the best options and knowledge she can offer.

Although we moved far from her clinic, since I have my job close to Dr. Hoefner's office, my girl will have Dr. ""Bambi"" as long as we are in Houston."

She is so caring and is always willing to go the extra step for you and your child. I am so happy we found her. Her staff is fantastic as well, so nice and accomodating. This practice is worlds away from the pediatric ""mills"" run by TCH where wait times were ridiculous and doctors were rushed and impersonal and staff was not friendly or helpful, to say the least. Thank you, Dr. Hoefner!"

Her caring attitude and assertiveness has helped us navigate complex medical teams at Texas Childrens Hospital on several occasions, where the politics and slow schedule often cause and prolong a child's pain. She has been available on weekends and visited on her days off. She has correctly diagnosed several uncommon episodes that took Specialists months to figure out. I feel confident stating that my daughter would not be the healthy, well adjusted teenager that she is today without Dr. Savrick's care."

Highly recommended"

67,Dr. Susan L. Sponenberg,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,6,4.92,2008-04-15T09:47:48Z,5,5,5,5,5,"I was looking for another doctor on this webpage and decided to look up Dr. Sponenberg who was my daughters doctor for 15 yrs. We both love her. She always answered our questions and never made us feel like she needed to hurry and get to another patient. My daughter and I still talk about her and she wishes that Dr. Sponenberg, could still be her doctor. She is just someone that you will never forget. She always made my daughter feel special."
68,Dr. Susan L. Sponenberg,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,6,4.92,2008-02-19T12:09:16Z,5,5,5,5,5,I loved dr sponenberg growing up I wish I could have her as my sons doctor but I will be in another state. After moving on to another doctor it just didnt feel right lol I guess you can say I wasnt ready to grow up and leave from her office just yet she was like a friend and a doctor all in one!!
69,Dr. Alyssa Kuban,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,6,4.92,2013-11-12T12:58:44Z,4.5,5,3,5,5,"This was our first visit. We waited over 45 minutes in main waiting room. When I went to front desk and asked about wait time, a few minutes later we were called back. Everyone was very apologetic. Staff was very nice. Dr. Kuban took the time to review my daughter's entire medical file prior to seeing us. I was very impressed with her. Will definitely use her again and highly recommend her."
70,Dr. Alyssa Kuban,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,6,4.92,2013-05-04T03:00:33Z,5,5,5,5,5,"My son came in sick. And he really doesn't like having any kind of test done! For he flu test they have to stick the big Q-tip up his nose. Well for some reason he got all worked up and threw up after it was done. Dr. Kuban came in the room and saw what had happened. She was on her hands and knees helping me clean up after my son! Not having a nurse come in to clean up his throw-up! But she was doing it!! You don't see that anymore! She was very sweet with him, and made sure he was feeling ok. And Checked to make sure my daughter who was with us was ok too! She answers all our questions and talks to my children! Which is a HUGE plus to me! They are little but they are people too and they are the ones that can tell you what is wrong if you listen...and she does! She is a keeper! And I hope she is around for my grand-daughter in September! I would like her to see her also! She is just all around wonderful!"
71,Dr. Alyssa Kuban,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,6,4.92,2012-11-21T00:27:02Z,5,5,5,5,5,"We have just moved to the area and I am very picky about my children's doctors. I had went on my insurance website and saw Dr. Kuban's name. Then I researched her, and saw alot of great things about her. After taking my son to see her. I have found she is wonderful! The best pediatrician I have ever been to! She takes time with my son, and doesn't try to rush out the door to get to the next person. She spoke to him to see how he was and what was bothering him! Usually they ask us parents and not the kids! Well, she didn't and my son was very comfortable with her! Which makes mom happy! When mama's happy...everyone is happy! Her staff are friendly, and the office is clean!! They separate the sick and healthy kids which is a great idea as my son was sick. And I wouldn't want him to get another child sick by coughing or sneezing! I think Dr. Kuban is warm and kind and goes above and beyond for her patients! And that makes a GREAT Doctor!!!"
72,Dr. Alyssa Kuban,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,6,4.92,2012-07-09T16:42:40Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Kuban is one of the best pediatricians that I have ever gone to. She is wonderful with all four of my children (ages 12, 9, 2, 1) and has a very warm bedside manner. My 2 yr old is not afraid to see her or go to the doctors at all because of the time that she spends. She is very knowledgable but does not talk over your head. Dr. Kuban spent time to answer all of the questions that I had and wanted to make sure that I felt comfortable and understood. SHe is also a very friendly person to be around. I would highly recommend Dr. Kuban and have recommended her to my friends."
73,Dr. Alyssa Kuban,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,6,4.92,2012-07-09T12:46:12Z,5,5,5,5,5,Great doctor! My kids absolutely love her! I am so thankful that we found Dr. Kuban!

Really don't even think twice, she's the best !! Returns calls 24*7, advises what's the best option, calms us down as we are always worried about our little one :) You could end up waiting a little but that's very normal with a pediatrician !"
94,Dr. Sheri L. Mitchell,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,11,4.84,2013-08-31T14:43:33Z,5,5,5,5,5,"She is the absolute best DR.

Again, absolute best!!!"
95,Dr. Sheri L. Mitchell,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,11,4.84,2013-03-14T19:52:52Z,4.5,4,4,5,5,"All I can say is I love, love, love Dr. Mitchell. She is such a great doctor and so personable. My first visit with her for my 1st child, which was 15 yrs ago, was fantastic. I was instantly drawn to her personality. She remembers the patient's name as well as any nicknames that you may have for them. More doctors need to call and ask her how to provide 5-star service."

Mitchell,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,11,4.84,2012-03-07T10:59:12Z,4.8,5,4,5,5,We have been visiting Dr. Mitchell for only a year but even in our first visit she was an instant favorite with my boys and me. She is casual but knowledgeable the kind of doctor that can tell you like it is with out hurting feelings.
97,Dr. Sheri L. Mitchell,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,11,4.84,2010-12-16T09:27:37Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Sheri Mithcell has been a hugh blessing to my family. She has been my children pediatrician for almost 12 years now. I have one child that has grown out of asthma, and another one that still deals with it. She always has the right solution for care, and also to put my worrying mind at peace. I love the connection that she has with her patients which she calls her children. I love that she takes an interest in their mental well-being as well as physical. I travel far to see her because I know that my children are in wonderful hands when they are being cared by her. I have recommended her to all of my family and friends. As long as she's a doctor of pediatrics, we will be her patients until my children become too old."
98,Dr. Sheri L. Mitchell,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,11,4.84,2009-01-17T04:32:55Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Mitchell has been my kids dr for over 15 years I have twins boys and of course I was a total wreck when I had them. She was very reassuring to both me and my husband. We could reach her at anything, get a call back pronto, and I would feel better after that one phone call. Whenever they visit her she question them about grades, sports, etc. So she's not only concern with thier physical well being she also like to know how they are during overall. I would recommend her without any reservation to any parent. She is very knowlegeable and has excellent bedside manners. ps she continues to make my twins laugh today because she can not tell them apart after 15 years."
99,Dr. Sheri L. Mitchell,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,11,4.84,2008-12-01T02:07:41Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Mitchell is top-notched in her field. She goes well above the call of duty in dealing with families with special needs toddlers/infants. She is compassionate, empathetic and is truly dedicated to her profession -pediatrics. My grand-daughter was born with a large hole in every chamber of her heart. Dr. Mitchel worked with the family before, during and after my grand-daughter's surgery to ensure her breathing and nutritional needs were not compromised. The other doctors speak highly of her, especially at Texas Children's Hospital. I highly recommend her"
100,Dr. Jan K Davis,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,9,4.86,2014-01-16T17:29:36Z,5,5,5,5,5,"I saw the good reviews and decided to choose Jan as our Pediatrician after our baby was born 7 days ago. It was a great experience the whole way. The gentleman at the desk was very nice and professional, the nurse was sweet and the Dr. was very generous with her time and easy to talk with. We were assigned another pediatrician by the hospital where their staff never greeted us, didn't say a word to us as they walked us to our room and the Doctor was not nearly as thorough. It was only our first visit but I really liked what we saw."
101,Dr. Jan K Davis,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,9,4.86,2012-09-05T01:52:00Z,4.8,5,4,5,5,Dr. Davis is so kind and knows her stuff. Why can't every doctor be like this? She returns phone calls and we never feel rushed. Appointments are easy to make and I wouldn't go anywhere else. If bedside manners matter to you then she is your doctor. Thanks Dr. Davis!
102,Dr. Jan K Davis,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,9,4.86,2012-05-18T08:30:49Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Jan Davis is a wonderful pediatrician! Her knowledge and gentle demeanor are amazing. My husband and I are first time parents and must have asked her a million questions at all times of the day and night and she was always patient, kind and helpful - even at 3:00am! I've never encountered another physician with a better bedside manner. If you want the best for your child I highly recommend Dr. Jan Davis."
103,Dr. Jan K Davis,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,9,4.86,2012-03-08T04:33:02Z,4.8,5,4,5,5,Dr. Davis is friendly and great with getting back to you and answering questions. Her nurse Jani is also great! I'm glad we choose them for our child's care. They are knowledgeable and caring and professional and just plain what you wish every doctor and nurse would be like.
104,Dr. Jan K Davis,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,9,4.86,2011-05-07T22:12:55Z,5,5,5,5,5,"What I really like about Dr. Davis is even when I talk to her about whatever, she never took her eyes away from my child. She constantly observes him to see how he acted and progressed during the whole time we were in her office. Very knowledgeable and caring doctor, and the same goes to her nurse, Jani."
105,Dr. Jan K Davis,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,9,4.86,2011-03-14T14:44:30Z,4.8,4,5,5,5,"Dr. Davis is awesome and so is her husband, Rick, when he works the front desk. We love her since we brought our first child to her and we now have 4. She is patient, kind, professional, and a great listener. And most importantly her approach to medicine is clear and logical. We love her and we have driven over 30 min since we moved and paid in cash to keep seeing her."
106,Dr. Jan K Davis,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,9,4.86,2010-10-18T14:11:28Z,4.5,4,4,5,5,"Dr. Davis is a great pediatrician. She sincerely cares about kids and you never feel like a number to her; she is never rushing out the door - when she's with you, she's focused on you until she's sure you don't have more questions. She is also willing to work with us to modify our son's vaccination schedule, although she also made it clear that she strongly recommended that we get all of them done. And when you call on weekends you talk to her or her nurse - folks who know your child, not a service at a hospital somewhere. I am very happy we chose her as our Dr."
107,Dr. Jan K Davis,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,9,4.86,2008-10-07T10:38:30Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Very helpful staff. Down to earth. I am always able to make an appointment when I want, on the day I want. The nurse is super friendly, as is Dr. Davis herself. And, you can't beat that Dr. Davis answers her own calls after hours. In an emergency, I want to be able to get to the doctor quickly, and I know I can with Dr. Davis."
108,Dr. Jan K Davis,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,9,4.86,2008-07-29T20:37:38Z,5,5,5,5,5,"I can always get an appointment with Dr. Davis on the same day I call. Her practice is small, with only one nurse and herself. Dr. Davis and her nurse, Jani have really made an effort to get to know my children as people. They have a no-nonsense approach to medical care. They are straightforward with the kids, explaining why they are doing certain procedures, but they do it with care. Any time of day or night, someone answers the phone. Dr. Davis, herself takes calls in the middle of the night...not an answering service. I cannot say enough good things about the practice. Nothing about the office is fancy or swanky. In fact, they do all their record keeping by hand, with limited computer use. This is the kind of doctor's office you went to when you were a kid."
160,Dr. Alexander Injac,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Male,22,3.86,2013-06-07T17:04:33Z,2,4,2,1,1,"After the birth of our son, we took our son to the pediatrician who we selected to be Dr. Marilyn Wilking, she was on vacation and unfortunately we landed on the hands of the most incompetent available pediatrician in that practice, Alexander Injac. Injac destroyed our family and caused physical and emotional harm to my son. I would recommend that you do not take your children to Injac as he does not know how to treat children. Even her nurse quit working for him and switched doctors. Injac is a coward, hides away behind others and is not a man to show his sick mind. Injac’s medical license should be removed and not allowed to treat children."
161,Dr. Alexander Injac,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Male,22,3.86,2012-05-18T20:26:01Z,4,3,3,5,5,"Today I was waiting with my son to see another doctor in the practice because our regular doctor (Dr. Injac) was fully booked. The other doctor was running way late, and Dr. Injac ran into us in the waiting room as he was leaving. He saw us, remembered my son by name, and told the receptionist he would see us right away. We went back with him and he treated my son. He didn't have to do this, and I truly appreciated it. We have been seeing Dr. Injac for two years and I have found him to be kind, reassuring, and very knowledgeable. He tries very hard to develop a warm rapport with my young son. It's true the practice is huge and sometimes waiting times are frustrating, but it's worth it to see Dr. Injac. We love him!"
162,Dr. Alexander Injac,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Male,22,3.86,2012-01-12T10:17:57Z,4.3,4,3,5,5,"Dr. Injac has cared for our family for 9 years now and we love and trust him. He develops a genuine rapport with the kids and they're always happy to see him. He listens to my questions and concerns and takes his time with us during each appointment. Once, his nurse interrupted our appointment to tell him his alarm company and the police called to say his house was being robbed. He said ""Tell them I'll call them back."". He put our family and our appointment first. He's given us his personal cell phone number to call if we ever need anything. I can't imagine a better pediatrician, although I'm also comfortable with several of the other doctors in the practice and happy to see them for an urgent visit if he is unavailable. The practice has enough doctors and hours that we've always been able to get an appointment when we need one."
163,Dr. Alexander Injac,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Male,22,3.86,2011-10-27T10:08:14Z,4.5,4,4,5,5,"I love Dr. Injac. He has been my son's doctor since his birth and is nothing short of amazing. He has always taken time with us, answered ALL my questions and has never rushed us. Even though we live 5 hours away from Houston I still make trips to Houston just for my son's checkups and vaccinations! He has always gone above and beyond, i.e. when my grandmother went on one of my son's appointments he even spoke in to Spanish to her to make her feel welcome... Nothing but great things to say about him!"
164,Dr. Alexander Injac,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Male,22,3.86,2011-10-12T14:35:37Z,1.8,1,2,1,3,"I interviewed several doctors before choosing Alex Injac. I was impressed during the 1st year and after that, I continued to be disappointed by him and the whole practice. I find him dismissive, hurried, insensitive, and flat out wrong about his diagnosis (on 3 separate occasions). There are other doctors out there that truly deserve your business and who will not disappoint!"
165,Dr. Alexander Injac,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Male,22,3.86,2011-03-16T14:36:11Z,4.8,5,4,5,5,Our family loves Dr. Injac. I found him to be extremely knowledgeable about any concern we had and always willing to listen. Would recommend him to anyone.
166,Dr. Alexander Injac,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Male,22,3.86,2011-02-16T08:41:29Z,4.8,4,5,5,5,Dr. Injac goes above and beyond. He met us on a Sunday night up at the office when my daughter was having a bad allergy attack and saved us a trip to the ER. He is amazing and caring and very informed. I am stunned to read any negative reviews about this doctor.
167,Dr. Alexander Injac,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Male,22,3.86,2010-07-21T09:41:10Z,4.8,4,5,5,5,"We have been seeing Dr. Injac for 9 years now and I'm shocked anyone would have anything bad to say about this physician. Like all human beings, we've seen him have a bad day, but that has never gotten in the way of the care we received. Choosing a pediatrician is a long term committment if you are concerned about the health of your children. Unless there is something more than ""they were in a bad mood"", you shouldn't change pediatricians on a whim. A doctor needs to know the history of your child. This doctor is someone you can place your trust in and know that he will have their best interest at heart."
168,Dr. Alexander Injac,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Male,22,3.86,2010-06-17T22:45:40Z,5,5,5,5,5,"My children and I really enjoy Dr. Injac. He has always been enjoyable and professional. He is very through and attentive when tending to my children and never rushes our time. He is one in a million. He makes me feel like my concerns are legitimate and never makes me feel pressured to agree to tests or shots. I had a home birth for both my children and tend to lean toward the conservative side of immunizations and medicine and he never makes me feel pressured into giving my children more than I feel is needed. He is a wonderful man and I am very thankful we found him. We have never had to wait longer than is normal for an appointment, and He has always seem knowledgeable in the illnesses my children have had.- Allison"
169,Dr. Alexander Injac,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Male,22,3.86,2010-06-11T13:18:44Z,4.5,4,4,5,5,"I am actually shocked at some of these negative reviews. Dr. Injac is an amazing doctor. I've never had a bad experience and I've taken my daughter to him exclusively for over 4 years. He has an amazing knowledge base. Every little thing that comes up, he quotes the latest research, studies, and gives his opinion as well. He is very open to my input as a mom. He is not arrogant and never takes my questions or decisions as an insult to his advice. He knows that ultimately the parent is the one in charge of the care. He is very nurturing to my children. They adore him. He spends a lot of time gaining their trust before examining them. I have never felt rushed. We had an emergency once and he went above and beyond to treat my child so we could avoid the emergency room. He is one of a kind!! The only negative I see is the large and sometimes chaotic office, but it benefits us when we need afterhours care or saturdays. I love TCPA!"
170,Dr. Monica A. Mcgrann,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,4,5,2013-05-14T14:05:49Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. McGrann is by far the best, most concerned doctor I have ever seen.

175,Dr. Steven Alley,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Male,5,4.75,2010-01-06T22:44:27Z,4.5,4,4,5,5,"Dr Alley is very personable and my kids adore him. When he is in the room, it is like he has nothing else to do except care for my child. (even though the waiting room will tell you otherwise). I am in the medical profession and his judgement is always right on."
176,Dr. Steven Alley,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Male,5,4.75,2009-06-13T20:05:06Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Alley is a fantastic pediatrician. He is able to address the needs of our son and family really well. I appreciate his ability to be unfazed, to always answer questions knowledgeably and completely. My son is always smiling in his office. Additionally, his staff is fantastic and helpful. The other physicians in the group are very good as well, and it's really easy to be seen by someone in the practice on very short notice."
177,Dr. Steven Alley,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Male,5,4.75,2008-11-12T21:08:10Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Alley is the best pediatrician we have ever been to. We have three kids and we've been to a number of pediatricians, but have always been unhappy. Dr. Alley spends time with and listens very carefully. He has a great personality and never (ever) makes you feel rushed. In fact I've never felt so ""unrushed"" with any doctor in my entire life. And on the occasions when Dr. Alley has not been there, we've had great experiences with other doctors in the practice as well. They are simply the best."
178,Dr. Steven Alley,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Male,5,4.75,2007-07-03T22:12:42Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Alley has been my daughter's pediatrician for almost 6 years. His staff has always been over the top helpful, professional and efficient. Dr. Alley is calm, kind, gentle doctor who handles kids and their parents with respect. They are really good about fitting us in if our child has a high fever or needs to be seen right away. There has been only one time in the last 6 years where we had to wait more than 30 minutes. It also helps that I like all the the other pediatricians he practices with, so if he cannot see us, I'm just as happy seeing Dr. Filak or Dr. Regan. They all have a great rapport with children and parents, and take time to make sure you understand what they are saying."

I am a doctor shopper for my 2 boys & so far I have either ran into badly behaved ,cranky staff or doctors that really don't give you a chance to ask questions or just unsatisfactory service. I was very careful to check internet reviews before I picked her. All her reviews were very positive. My kids loved Dr Taylor-cox. She answers all my question. She was very patient. ALL of the staff was so friendly and good with the kids. If you pick this Doctor or any doctor, please write reviews, it is very important for people like me who have had bad experiences but still strive to look for the best..."

194,Dr. Kathryn B. Glass,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,7,4.39,2012-07-20T17:21:09Z,4.8,5,4,5,5,"I just recently took my son for his well child exam to Dr. Glass. We hadn't used her before but the other doctors in the same practice had good ratings. When we got there we waited for about 5 minutes in the waiting room before being called which was awesome). When we got to the exam room the nurse, Michael, was very pleasant and quick. There was an emergency with another patient so both Michael and Dr. Glass came to apologize for the delay. We waited for about 20 min before the doctor came back. She well compensated for the wait. She spent about 45 minutes with us. She answered all of our questions (as my 10 year had MANY), was very knowledgable, and explained many things to not only us but our son as well. She was amazing with him. We're very happy to have found her."

For the most part her staff is great with the exception of the front desk person. The only way to describe her is uncaring and rude. She has time to chat with co-workers but not enough time to answer a question from a parent. I realize that time can be limited but if you have time to discuss personal matters you should have time to open the glass door and acknowledge people. Several people complained about her while I was there. I am very patient and understanding about wait time but it is getting out of control. I waited several hours to see the doctor and no information wa verified (ie insurance) until I was about to see the doctor. This I am sure also causes some delays in the process of seeing the patients. If you have someone rude at the front it makes your office appear to be unfriendly because of the fact that this person is the first one you deal with. Overall the doctor is great!"

Seriously, the nurses in this office are incompetent, which is frightening since they are the ones giving the immunizations. I had the SAME experience as the earlier comment--a nurse brought in a syringe labeled ""FLU"" by mistake, and when I brought it to her attention she tried to cover her mistake and said that it was an immunization shot that was mislabeled. I picked up my baby and LEFT THE OFFICE with that liar standing there watching!! Can you imagine the harm that is probably taking place at that office on a regular basis? Stay away from there!!"

My young teenage cousin came down with a rare virus that could and almost did claim his life. Dr KOZAK took care and diagnosed him quickly and he was put at Texas childrens downtown Nd was there for over a week. Thanks to his early diagnosis they were able to diagnosis a heart condition and he now lives a very normal life!
I have three girls of my own and all have seen him since birth. We've never had him reject our requests. My newest baby had salmonella at 3 months old and he ordered a stool sample right away and calls me himself anytime we have test results come back abnormal or positive. Takes very good care of my babies makes me feel validated as a mother caring for my babies. Never dismissive and always listens! Often gives me an option on course of treatment;) can't say enough good things! Best dr in the woodlands for pediatrics! "

He is thorough, and he has never rushed us through an appointment...even when we are his last of the day. He has diagnosed my children accurately, and he discusses all possible treatment options to best fit our needs. I was skeptical at first, since he is so young. But, I have been taking my children to him for over a year and a half now and I am 100% sold. He listens, addresses all of my concerns (no matter how big or small...or seemingly silly), and he really seems to care. He is knowledgeable, his attitude is excellent, and he makes my children squeal with delight...truly! This, of course, makes me very happy. He is wonderful!

The results came back positive for E- COLI which is very dangerous and deadly disease. This Doctor did not listen to me, and my babay could have been gone by now if i had not force him to check her stools. This Doctor was arrogant and his treatment plan did not make sense, my child just got worst and worst under his care. He even gave me a prescription for a medicine that can only be given to adults, and that should only be given after lab work is performed."

His office staff has remained the same all these years - a great sign! He has added a few new nurses and they are very knowledgeable. The wait is never more than 10 minutes, and since he doesn't double book, he will actually sit and talk with you. He usually asks me several times if I have any more questions, and is very easy to talk to. Office staff is very helpful. He is very popular in the area, so he books up fast. For well child exams I typically have to book about a month out. For sick children, they get me in within an hour or so."

He was there when they were born. When I've moved and tried to find another doctor close to where we live, we always make the drive to him because no other doctor comes close to his experience, care, trained office staff and no matter what it is he can help or see you. Sometimes there is a long wait, but that's ok because he's taking care of everyone who needs him. He is by far the most exceptional Pediatrician all around. I would recomend him to anyone."

My daughters pediatrician is helpful, punctual and very knowledgeable. The longest I've had to wait was 12 minutes. I have never had a problem with his staff. They have always been professional. I highly recommend him!!: Pediatric Medical Group: Allison III James E MD 4101 Greenbriar St # 100, Houston, TX 77098-5299 (713) 526-6443 ?

He was my doctor as a chid and now that I'm grown with my wn children They will see him also. I can't believe the bad comments you all are saying. Dr. Shaffer hasnt seen me in years but still knows my name so you cant say he doesn't care for his clients. I made an appointment for my children to visit in two weeks so we will see whats the fuss about but I still say thats one great doctor!

His father was the pediatrician for myself and my two siblings for 32 years. He is frank and to the point. I love him because he is not a new age by the book doctor. He sticks to a lot of the old remedies (and a prescription if necessary) that my grandmother advised of. My son is really healthy and we have never went wrong with Dr. Schaffer. As far as the staff, there is only one older nurse that is really rude. But I just ignore her or badger her until I get the information I want out of her. Overall a great doctor. His reputation does allow for back up in the waiting room as well. But again, it is worth it."
260,Dr. Don M. Schaffer,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Male,11,3.75,2010-01-04T14:25:06Z,2,1,1,3,3,"Sadly, although we like Dr. Shaffer, I have decided to find another doctor. The office personnel is rude and unresponsive. Almost every time we used his services we were waiting over 2 hours. Last time, my son was sick with high fever. We waited over 2 hours even though he was shivering. I requested a blanket, but they told me they did not have any, so my son was left waiting for this long time without any help. Additionally I was overcharged for a visit that is covered by my insurance, but the billing personnel don´t want to be bothered fixing it and reimburse me for the overcharge. I have no complaint about Dr. Shaffer but in order to have a good practice all the personnel needs to offer the best care and service, which is not the case"

Every time I take him to an appointment, Dr. Schaffer takes his sweet time to see my son. He's not friendly, and I feel that he's always trying to rush us out. My son had an appointment last week because he's sick, and I listed off all of the symptoms my son's been having (which is a LOT), and all Dr. Schaffer told me was to try a different formula! So I ended up reading online about my baby's symptoms, and I was able to diagnose what he had, but he couldn't! SO then I went to my local walgreens that has a 24-hour well-care clinic, spoke to the doctor there, and HE was more helpful than Dr. Schaffer. He diagnosed my son with the same thing that I diagnosed. Only problem I have left is that Dr. Schaffer has to write the Rx for what my son needs, and I can't get ahold of him! My hubby called and talked to the nurse, told her the situation, and she said she'd have him call back. Guess what? No call."

He was my daughter's pediatrician before we moved, and I hated to leave him. His bedside manner is excellent.

The front office was crazy and they kept trying to send me to different doctors and waiting rooms. The problem is getting a hold of her for questions. I've been waiting over two weeks for a call back and have left 4-5 messages with nurses calling me back to let me know she has my message. I'm not getting the feeling that she cares about my situation or my family.

CPSO#: 105615.
We were referred by a Neurologist to Dr. Jackie, for emergency reasons the appointment had to be rescheduled. The staff by the name of Chelsey rescheduled it and was suppose to call back to confirm the new date but didnt, instead she called on the day of the appointment and was very rude threathening us that we will be billed $170. She was extremely arrogant and when I asked to speak with Dr. Jackie regarding her unprofessional attitude, she refused and then disconnected the call while I was still on the line.
I woukd like Dr. Jackie to know how this staff (Chelsey) was extremely insulting and rude to patients and because of her alot of patients will not be coming back or asking for refrerals somewhere else.
Clearly this disrespectful staff Chelsey doesnt care because she only works there but I hope Dr. Jackie cares and take action in this matter right away.
Im speechless because this staff Chelsy is out of place and I cant believe shes working at a doctors office insulting patients. I hope she is fired because we will not be coming back until Dr. Jackie takes action. Employing arrogant employees like Chelsey who insukts patients is unnacceptable.
I'll make sure to send this feedback to the board."

I can count on one hand the number of times each of our kids have taken an antibiotic, as he prefers to use preventive methods rather than over prescribe meds. He is down to earth, practical, always willing to look for cost-savings in treatment. He's a gem and made raising our kids a lot less stressful.... We love you Dr. Hanby!!!"

My daughter had jaundice for 2 months from breast milk (which I self diagnosed and cured with formula later) and threatened to send daughter to hospital. I asked ab putting her on formula to rid the jaundice and she said no. They pricked my kid 8 times in 6 weeks to check levels. This was preventable and could have been corrected early on and wasn't.
Never returned my phone calls until my husband got involved."

I was not a fan of the office staff or wait times at TCPH, but I LOVE the staff at Sprout, the new clinic she has opened. I have never had to wait more than 5 minutes, and everyone from the receptionist to the doctors are kind and helpful. Dr. Dehlavi has always been wonderful with my boys and takes the time to answer the many, many questions I have, whether it is at an appointment or over the phone. When she hasn't had the answers to problems, she has either referred me to specialists or, where appropriate, done research and gotten back to me. She is also supportive of my desire to try a natural approach when possible, which is incredibly important to me. We are so very, very happy that Dr. Dehlavi has her own practice now and that she takes such good care of our kids. (And as a bonus, my oldest loves her, and I'm sure the baby will, too, as he gets older)"
299,Dr. Afshan Dehlavi,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,14,3.39,2014-03-03T18:40:10Z,4.8,5,4,5,5,"I love Dr.Dehlavi! She explains everything thoroughly to me. She cares for my girls. We have seen her for the last 6 years and have been very happy with her. She just opened her own practice with Dr. White, who I also like. The long wait times were because of Texas children's over scheduling her. We saw 5 other pediatricians that were ok before we found Dr.Dehlavi. I have recommended her to friends and they have switched and loved her. I don't understand her misdiagnosis of illnesses. I have never had a problem with this. I trust her completely with my kids."
300,Dr. Afshan Dehlavi,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,14,3.39,2013-04-05T09:03:02Z,1.5,3,1,1,1,"Staff was ok, not too friendly, i took my daughter there once on a late appointment cause she was sick, and they did some tests, but since it was late they took me out of the room and made me wait for the results in the hallway, with a sick baby, I told her that her big sister had strep throat so I though that I thought that is what my baby had, her response was ""babies this young don't get strep"" i said i still wanted her tested, she was reluctant but she tested for strep.... After waiting for 20 mins in the hallway for the results, the results showed she had strep throat!!! She is horrible and does not like to listen to parents, and if you are a parent like me who is ready to question anybody, she gets extremely defensive, probably cause she does not have good answers"

Seems nice at first but her true colors will eventually rise. Complains about my kids and the time we've taken. Forces higher meds when they're not needed. I can go on and on but I'll refrain. Good luck.

My son was born with a bad case of GERD which she promptly diagnosed adn treated and when I ran into problems breastfeeding, she never once tried to tell me to give up and formula feed, but helped me through it, advised me to attend a BF class and she even watched my crying child for a while so I could attend the class. My tween daughter loved her so much she begged me to switch her over to Dr. Delhavi, whose gentle and friendly manner makes her feel at ease. You know how tween girls are, but she loves Dr. Dehlavi and feels very comfortable talking to her. I will continue to take my children to Dr. Delhavi for as long as possible, she may be young but she has a great bedside manner, a great listener to us as parents and very knowledgeable or willing to do the research if she doesn't have all the answers."
304,Dr. Afshan Dehlavi,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,14,3.39,2010-12-16T23:04:54Z,2.5,3,2,3,2,"She is a lovely lady, but we always, always had to wait for almost an hour to be seen. I don't feel like she diagnosed my daughter's illness correctly, we went ahead and got another opinion that didn't include treatment with antibiotics (not a big fan). I never looked at the fact that we was young, but at the end it seems that she just does not have enough experience."

The office has a lab so your kid will never get antibiotic unless they absolutely need them. They have an x-ray on site so no toting a child with something broken to the nearest hospital. Dr. Harry is great with the kids very funny. He is really nice to new parents too. He never made me feel like I was a bother even when I called 6 times in one day. This is the best care you can get for your kid.

When calling the office, occassionaly I have been on hold so long that I had to hang and call back twice but Dr Bootin has been the only pediatrician I've stuck with because I feel like she loves kids and wants to help and is not just there doing a job to collect a paycheck.

I have asked to see another Dr. in the office but of course not possible... We are transferring. My daughter is sick 1-2 a week! Dr. Yu says thats normal... last year we took her to a allergy and asthma Dr and they diganosed her with something so common-a bacterial infection that she apparently had for over a year and Dr. Yu never noticed it. Now she's going through same thing we took her into another Dr. for 2nd opinion and of course they say somethings diffently wrong and she needs to go see a specialist. Dr. Yu still doesn't agree... She said children get sick every week most her patients do and thats normal. Did not make me feel better if anything now I feel like she mistreating all her patients, don't go here."

It is a shame that this should happen and I should have to take so many days off work for something she should have diagnosed after 2 or 3 visits."

He rounded at 5 am to avoid any questions from groggy recovering parents. He was abrupt, rushed, and unfriendly. Worse, he discharged my 5 lb baby. Two days later we were at the Texas Childrens ER, checking our son into the NICU with a biliruben level of 20. He stayed 3 days. Has Dr. wolens been less concerned with geting his rounds done quickly so he could move on to more lucrative office patients, we might have avoided this terrible experience. I wrote the doctor a letrer regarding our terrible experience. Not surprisingly, i received no response."

Like the reviewer before me, Dr Watson refused to see my baby for her 9month check up for being 15 mins late. I tried calling them prior to the start of my appointment to tell them that I had ran into an accident that was slowing down my commute, but was continually greeted by an automated system that said their entire staff was handling other calls & that I should remain on hold till my call could be answered.
I arrived to my appointment before that happened. When I walked into the EMPTY waiting room, I explained to the front desk girl what had occurred and she very rudely said she would have to reschedule me.
It did not matter that I had waited on the doctor for HOURS at my previous appointments. It did not matter that I tried to reach them before my appointment time to tell them what had happened (they later told me all their calls are being routed to a calling center and reaching the office directly will be next to impossible). It did not matter that I had overlooked questionable medical care in the past.
IE: On my child's first visit, the medical assistant was unable to completely saturate all five circles during the Neonatal heel prick test so my child had to be pricked TWICE on one visit. When I returned a month and a half later, I was told that she would have to be pricked again because the assistant OVER saturated the circles upon the second heel prick during the last visit. In all, my child was pricked a total of 4 times (twice on each heel, one for each appointment) for a simple test that should have only been ONE.
I was given the number to their manager Roderick who promised that seeing me would not be an issue. I remained in the waiting room for an additional 10 minutes before another medical assistant came up and said the DOCTOR SAID she would not see me. If they would have answered their phone when I called 15 mins before the start of my appointment then I could have saved about an hour of time and headache.
PLEASE SAVE YOURSELF THE HEADACHE AND DO NOT GO HERE."

He has cared for all three of my daughters including a very sick one. He genuinely cares, he is extremely punctual and well mannered and always very professional. He has good medical advice and has the gut instincts that are uniquely reserved for truly gifted doctors. He doesn't prescribe medications unnecessarily but diagnoses the issue using in-house lab testing. He usually meets with us right at our appointment time. I like his sense of humor. I don't feel so comfortable with the other doctors in his practice however and some of the nurses are a bit abrasive.

358,Dr. Debra L. Luben,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,4,4.06,2013-09-01T21:07:14Z,2.8,5,4,1,1,Dr Luben cares for 3 of my children. Over the last year I have became dissatisfied with her. She's impatient and rude. She is in and out of the room within 15 minutes. When I leave I don't have a peace of mind. I am on the process of changing PCP for my kids; I still will be within the Kelsey Network. The front desk staff and Dr Luben nurse are so professional and nice.
359,Dr. Debra L. Luben,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,4,4.06,2011-12-08T14:43:25Z,5,5,5,5,5,"She is the best doctor I have ever had for my kids. To begin with, she is very careful in making an accurate diagnosis, and she is just wonderful. She answers all questions very nicely and gives you all the information you need. She promptly gets back to give the test results. She is the BEST PEDIATRICIAN. My kids love going to her clinic."
360,Dr. Debra L. Luben,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,4,4.06,2011-07-18T14:48:01Z,3.5,4,3,3,4,"Dr. Luben has been my children's pediatrician since birth. She is very thorough, I am very happy with her. In fact, when I found out that she was not part of the network of the personal insurance I intended to purchase, I chose another insurance that had her in their network... that's how much I wanted to make sure she would remain my children's pediatrician."
361,Dr. Debra L. Luben,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,4,4.06,2009-04-20T15:37:47Z,5,5,5,5,5,"I have used a number of pediatricians for my three children over the years, but, by far, she is the most capable and professional physician I have met in this specialty. If your child has any complex health issues, she is the answer to your prayers!"

364,Dr. David M. Cotlar,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Male,3,4.33,2009-08-10T19:31:38Z,5,5,5,5,5,Wonderful Godly Man. Great Doctor. Kind Staff.
365,Dr. Liliane M. Hay,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,4,4,2016-04-22T10:35:06.136Z,5,5,5,5,5,"It is truly an amazing thing when you find a doctor you can trust your kids to. She is not only knowledgeable as a Doctor by the most honestly nice Dr. We've met. I like her approach to medicine as we only want medication for our kids when it is strictly necessary. As per some reviews, we have never had problem with billing, my husband is a medical biling manager and can attest for her modest billing practices.
We came to her office recommended by friends and it we absolutely love her and recommend to everybody else. Thank you Dr. Hay!"
366,Dr. Liliane M. Hay,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,4,4,2015-06-01T18:18:14.595Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Memorial City Pediatrics is a great pediatric office. The Doctors are great, the staff is helpful . We get an excellent pediatric service for our kids there."
367,Dr. Liliane M. Hay,Houston,Texas,NA, Female,4,4,2015-04-25T20:25:48.157Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr Hay has been the pediatrician of my 2 children for the past 7 years. She is sweet, kind and very knowledgeable. What I like about this particular office is that on several occasions my children were sick and I was able to get in to see the doctor the same day. Couple of times at night, one of my children had high fever and another time woke up vomiting and I was not sure what to do , I called the answering service and they were able to connect me with Dr Hay and I received assistance on what to do. I called few times during the day for non urgent questions and , no exception , I received a call from the office the same day. I can say that I truly receive an excellent pediatric service for my children with Dr Hay at Memorial City Pediatrics. Occasionally we have seen another doctor covering for Dr Hay, I believe it is Dr Sagullo, very sweet as well. And in 7 years , never had any issues on charges , insurance or billing with Memorial City Pediatrics. Very satisfied."
368,Dr. Liliane M. Hay,Houston,Texas,NA, Female,4,4,2014-11-20T13:35:03.820Z,1,1,1,1,1,Dr. Hay and her office staff are unprofessional and make fraudulent charges on insurance claims. She makes you wait 45 min- hour before she sees you even though you have an appointment. She doesn't take the time to talk to you or your children she just hands you a Wikipedia printout of things to do with your child and about his/her growth and development. I am upset I ever trusted her with my children.
369,Dr. Peter Y. Jung,Houston,Texas,NA, Male,3,4.88,2008-06-06T16:57:14Z,4.8,4,5,5,5,"I love Dr. Jung. When i was searching for a pedi for my baby to be, I originally meet with Dr. Pielop who is in the same office & decided on him. Dr. Jung saw my baby once she was born in the hospital sin ce he was the one on call. We also saw him the day after we were discharged from the hospital & I was blown away by him. He was great with the baby & answered all of our questions. When ever I have a question, I just call the office & leave a message & he returns it personally. Dr. Pielop was great too, but I just feel in love with how great a doctor Dr. Jung was that I switched my baby's pcp to him. The office is great & all the drs there are great as well."
370,Dr. Peter Y. Jung,Houston,Texas,NA, Male,3,4.88,2008-04-14T13:57:33Z,5,5,5,5,5,"I have benn going to Dr. Jung since last 2 years. He is the best doctor for my kid. He always answers all the questions thorougly and is never in a hurry. He is so kind that my kid always loves to vist his ""Doctor uncle"". They are so punctual, i have never waited more than 10 minutes."
371,Dr. Peter Y. Jung,Houston,Texas,NA, Male,3,4.88,2007-05-20T19:52:14Z,5,,5,5,5,I Love this Dr. I first got in touch with him because his father examined my son in the hospital when he was born. I decided to continue with them just because and I couldn't be happier. He is EXCELLENT with the kids and is supportive of the parents. He is happy to answer any questions and is always there to help. Love this Dr. A+++
372,Dr. Tara S. Ramsay,Pasadena,Texas,NA, Female,2,4.88,2015-07-20T20:14:53.151Z,5,5,5,5,5,Love this Dr. Will go out if her way. Call you personally. Will listen and set up for a specialist if necessary.
373,Dr. Tara S. Ramsay,Pasadena,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,2,4.88,2009-02-18T19:46:29Z,4.8,5,4,5,5,"I have three daughters and I take all three to Dr. Ramsay. I really recommend her because she always has an answer and if there is any question she will order further testing. My daughter had some puberty issues and she ordered ex: wrist x-ray, hormone levels and referred to an endocrine physician. I didn't even know that you can tell alot from the wrist bone structure. She is always thorough and will answer any and all your questions, she will never rush through just to go to the next patient."
374,Dr. Kin Lock,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Male,2,4.88,2010-11-17T16:06:09Z,4.8,5,4,5,5,well experience and very knowledgable. highly recommend.
375,Dr. Kin Lock,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Male,2,4.88,2009-08-08T23:08:46Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Lock is the best! My three children have been seeing him for years. We moved away from the area a few years ago but still make the drive to see him. My daughter was diagnosed with a rare blood disorder shortly after birth. He admitted he had not had another patient with this disorder,nor did he have extensive knowledge of it. He did his research and referred us appropriately. He always did follow ups. He is always extra careful with her considering her condition. We were in between insurance companies when she became very ill with a bad respiratory infection as an infant. We had to pay out of pocket and he discounted everything. We were very grateful. His nurses Trish and Irene are the best as well. The front desk people need a bit of customer service training. A friendly ""hello"" rather than an obviously obligatory one would be nice. Also, a smile every now and then won't hurt them...I promise. I go there for Dr. Lock and his staff. They are what truly counts."

Reddell,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,2,4.88,2011-06-24T15:44:36Z,4.8,4,5,5,5,"dr. reddell loves her patients and remembered us after the first visit. she spends the time to answer all my questions and when my daughter spilled an entire juice cup on the floor, she got on the floor with me to clean it up. she is a very gentle doctor towards her patients and i highly recommend her to anyone! i do not recommend the other doctors in her practice but she is the best!"
377,Dr. Patti J. Reddell,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,2,4.88,2008-09-27T21:37:52Z,5,5,5,5,5,Wonderful doctor...very detailed and looks at past history before each visit. I would recommend her to any first time/experienced mother.

She is very friendly and one of the best pediatricians I have ever seen. I trust her implicitly with my children's healthcare. I don't like Kelsey Seybold but she is worth going there. She deserves to be at a better practice.
379,Dr. Jakeen W. Johnson,Kingwood,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,2,4.88,2013-02-15T02:49:00Z,4.8,4,5,5,5,"We took our newborn to her and we have no complaints so far. Our baby is now two months old and we've been in 3 times. She has been very willing to take the time to answer any and all questions. She had no problems with adjusting the vaccination schedule for us either. So far, so good."

Im 22 years old and im still trying to find a family doctor that could even measure up to her standards. She's very personable and eager to listen. Her motherly persona gives you the ease needed to talk with her about everything going on from school,hm, to just general issues that you face daily that affects your health and well being.My brothers and I have gone to Dr. Cutler since we were little and when I say she enjoys family she truly does. Her nursing staff is always exceptional especially Ms. Michelle and Ms. Stella The team mirrors the exact characteristics of their Dr. Truly hope their still around when Im ready to start a family!"

384,Dr. Janie T. Doan,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,7,3.5,2014-08-01T11:45:32Z,1.3,1,2,1,1,They were supposed to make a referral for my son to see an allergist to refill his epinephrine. It has taken over a month to get them to send the right information to the allergist. They don't seem to care about the info that is needed by the allergist dr and referrals are only done one day a week. The staff is clueless and seems to only have high school educations and cannot be of help at all!!!
385,Dr. Janie T. Doan,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,7,3.5,2014-01-16T16:31:09Z,2,1,1,3,3,The doctor is great but her staff ruins everything. Wait time is ridiculous and everything u call for an appt it's always booked and only want to give you an appt they tell u. Even if your child has a fever they do not see you. They always tell you to take them to er or a urgent care. But when you do get to walk in to the office you see all these new patients filling out forms so no wonder they are always booked and I can't take my child in when sick. Jessica the front desk girl is rude and unattentive she gives u an attitude and mean look. She never looks happy at what she does whether in person or on the phone. Doesn't seem enjoying her job or helping their patients. Every time u have an appt u have to fill out your address information and they expect for u to do it even though nothing has changed.
386,Dr. Janie T. Doan,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,7,3.5,2013-09-23T13:55:50Z,5,5,5,5,5,Dr. is very informative and I am glad to see the same staff every time I go. Dr. Joan is one great doctor.

Dr. Doan & her staff have been nice & informative for every visit. Having a first child we always have lots of questions & the nurses are always helpful.
388,Dr. Janie T. Doan,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,7,3.5,2013-06-11T11:08:23Z,2,3,3,1,1,"totally dishonest, she charges an office visit for an immunization, although the immunization is 100 percent covered"

She took the time to not only listen to me but speak with my daughter and here her out. Dr. Holick is very thorough on explaining her plan for the patient and making sure we as parents understand so we can be on the same page with patient care. I would definitely recommend her!"
390,Dr. Michelle D. Holick,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,2,4.75,2014-01-27T01:35:48Z,4.8,5,5,5,4,"Dr. Holick is great. She is very comfortable to talk with and seems to truly listen. She doesn't seem to have a specific nurse that works with her, but seems to do all of the work herself. She returns phone calls and is easy to get appointments with. I would definitely recommend her!"
391,Dr. Douglas M. Suell,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Male,7,3.43,2014-07-25T12:48:07Z,2.3,3,1,2,3,Adding to my last comment made on 7/25/14: I have been going to him for 10 years now but it's time for a change for those reasons below.
392,Dr. Douglas M. Suell,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Male,7,3.43,2014-07-25T12:43:39Z,2.3,3,1,2,3,He used to be the greatest doctor but now he won't spend more than 5 minutes in the room. He is always rushed and seems bothered when asked questions. The wait time is long too--so he should at least stay in the room longer!! I am looking for a new pediatrician. The only good thing is that they have same day sick appointments but other than that it is a bad experience.
393,Dr. Douglas M. Suell,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Male,7,3.43,2011-04-01T16:05:04Z,2.3,1,1,4,3,very poor management. dont observe appointment time. good thing is that dont use much medicine
394,Dr. Douglas M. Suell,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Male,7,3.43,2010-09-02T13:50:17Z,2.8,1,1,4,5,He is a great doctor but the office staff is awful. They are lazy and unhelpful. I won't go back.
395,Dr. Douglas M. Suell,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Male,7,3.43,2010-02-09T19:35:58Z,4.8,5,4,5,5,"Both of our kids use Dr. Suell. Hes always very nice, helpful and reassuring. He's not your typical white coat, hes very laid back and makes you feel comfortable. Not to mention hes good with the kids."
396,Dr. Douglas M. Suell,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Male,7,3.43,2009-02-24T20:30:30Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Wonderful, professional and caring doctor. My son and I both love him, and he is not bad on the eyes either! ;) Highly recommend taking your children to his office. Although the office is 30 min. from home and my job, I don't mind the drive because I know my baby is in good hands."
397,Dr. Douglas M. Suell,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Male,7,3.43,2008-11-30T16:26:25Z,4.8,5,5,4,5,Great with kids. Doesn't wear the white lab coat and is very relaxed with kids.
398,Dr. Arturo Bautista,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Male,7,3.36,2011-08-05T11:09:37Z,4.5,5,5,4,4,"I have used Dr. Bautista for conveniance to hospital and he was recommended by OB. While I adore his staff, I became concerned about his attitude about 9 years ago. I am not sure if he is just grumpy or just really mean. He is just not as patient with the children, parents or his staff as he once was. At this point, I only use his office if I need shots or just cant get in at the new doc office. I do belive he knows medicine but he is just not very friendly."
399,Dr. Arturo Bautista,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Male,7,3.36,2011-05-03T15:58:04Z,3.5,5,5,2,2,"Dr Authro was refer to me by a friend. But after going a few time i notice that he was rude. I can say that his staff have always been friendly and consist.I do like the conv. of make same day appointment. How ever every time Ive taken my child to him, he did not listen to my concerns about my child. I hate to say that this is due to his age, a langauge barrier or if this is his normal. I even dislike to believe it's a racial thing as well. I would be cautous of taking my child there because I believe some things would be over looked and could cost you dearly. Fortunaly I was able to get my child away from his practice and go somewhere that they are concern and thoughtful. (please excuse my spelling)"
400,Dr. Arturo Bautista,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Male,7,3.36,2010-07-29T11:46:37Z,5,5,5,5,5,"When my son was born in 1998, his pediatrician (Dr. Kennedy) who was excellent, was retiring and recommended Dr. Bautista. He is still my sons physician. Always courteous & takes time to explain or address any concerns we have. Used to make this funny duck sound when looking in my sons ears!! Too funny. Laurie was a nurse when my son was a baby. She was so sweet and patient. Left to take care of her own child eventually. However, from the desk to the staff, we have always had personable and pleasant people. Dr. Bautista is a humanitarian as well (documented by news ads I have seen over the years). The older my son gets the less we have to go in but when we do, we try to get a peek at him because, yes, his wife is in the office. Find her charming as well. He will be our doctor until he decides to retire."
401,Dr. Arturo Bautista,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Male,7,3.36,2010-06-14T10:20:04Z,1.5,1,1,1,3,"I hated him the minute h opened his mouth. Dr Bautista was very rude, and did not care to find out or listen to my concerns. He hurt my son's feelings, and I wll yell at him if he tries it next time. It is unfortunate that I have to deal with him because his wife is away..."

My son had this very rare disease(HSP)and I took him to different doctors and none of them know what it is, until Dr. B knew without examine him right on the spot. It took my son 8 weeks to get rid of this disease. Now my 11 year old daughter when she was 5 years old she came down with pnuemonia and he admided her asap. she was in the hospital next to his his office for 3 days. He is the best."

406,Dr. Jose Carlos Interiano,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Male,6,3.46,2013-03-04T10:37:10Z,4.5,5,3,5,5,"I love Dr. Interiano and apparently so do many other parents. He is very nice and really knows what he is doing. His nurses are always for helpful and friendly. Unfortunately, his popularity makes it hard to keep on schedule. Expect to wait 1hr past your appointment time."

He does have a lot of MedCaid clients. And he does often rush through your meeting. Overall he's been there for my kids since birth and I trust him."

But lately its been going down hill. His waiting time even with appointment is about 2-3 hours!And to top it off there no toys or any sort of entertainment for the kids. Oh and if you go to the restroom you might lose your turn."

He has such a gentle manner with the children and every year on their birthday check-up, he sings Happy Birthday to them. He is so knowledgeable and makes you feel comfortable. I trust he is always doing the best for my children."
414,Dr. Jacobo Goldberg,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Male,2,4.5,2008-07-01T15:47:04Z,4.5,5,3,5,5,Very nice. The way he treats children and babies is incredible. Very helpful and answers all questions. He was my husbands doctor and now my baby's. He is bilingual.

Not thrilled but is ok with my choice to delay vaxs. She job shares with her sister so might not see her for every visit, i.e. sick visits. Will continue to use her as my Ped."
417,Dr. Bruno P. Chumpitazi,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Male,2,4.5,2014-01-27T01:43:20Z,4,3,3,5,5,"Dr. Chumpitazi is a great doctor. He has a great understanding of motility issues and is the best at diagnosing and treating these types of disorders. He can be difficult to get in touch with, as the staff doesn't often answer the phones and you can get caught in a circular phone tree that just gets confusing. Plan to wait a very long time for this appointment, but it will be worth it. The follow up could improve, but for difficult GI issues, this is the best doctor you can get!"

423,Dr. Negar Vazirinia,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Male,5,3.45,2009-10-04T20:37:42Z,2.3,1,5,2,1,"My child was born 3 weeks early and had a lingering case of jaundice. Dr. Vazirinia suggested taking my child outdoors and allowing sunlight to curb this case, which is great advice for some cases of jaundice. However, when after 3 weeks of my return visits and constant concern the jaundice was not going away, I demanded that a blood test be done, and a second opinion be given. Unfortunately the blood tests showed her Bilirubin count was so high we had to take her to the ER, and have painful IV and more blood taken. This all would have been avoided had this doctor known ANYTHING about jaundice and had me stop breast feeding for 24 hours to allow my child's liver to kick in. (Some breast fed children get a hormone from mother's milk which does not allow the liver to start. But after 24 hours of formula and returning to breast milk, the liver is now functioning perfectly.) I could have avoided a visit to the ER if this doctor had known this very important information."

We have been with her for 16yrs and she has always showed compassion, care and is very thorough. My kids love her and even though she is serious at times, I know my kids are in excellent hands. Her staff is great and they are very helpful. There are times when I have to wait but I know that she is providing thorough care to the patient she sees. "

Her staff is not to friendly but will get their jobs completed. Her nurses are very pleasant and helpful. Dr. Vohra is very througho with examinations and able to diagnose the problem going on. If not she will send you to someone who specializes in the field of need. She is not talkative, not joking around, and barely smiles, but she is able to treat your children well, and get what is nessesary for their health. She has helped to ensure both of my children for over 12 years. I fell very secure in thier health as long as Dr. Vohra is examining them and caring for thier needs. I wish that scheduling was done more accurately and that the wait was not as long as it always is to actually see Dr. Vohra. Also I wish if Dr. Vohra was not going to be available to see her patients and some Dr. was doing her schedule that I would be contacted, ahead of time. Instead of walking into the office and finding a little note hanging on the wall."

He really cares about his patients and send alot of time answering any and all questions. I am looking forward to sending my three little ones to him when they ae older.

Dr Stoerner is really good, through, knowledable and experienced and we like her that is the only reason we are not changing our pediatrician. The front desk people suck at their customer service.They don't convey the message to the dr or the nurse so you never get a call back from the office.They don't answer phone with their name so you don't know who is taking your message? I know of some friends that have stopped going to the Sugarland Pediatrics due to poor service. If things don't seem to get better they are going to loose us too...."

She is very knowledgeable, engaged and thorough in her analysis without being an alarmist. She is a physician to be respected and I would trust her with my most significant health issues. Too often dr's are judged by their ""fun factor""- I am entrusting any pediatrician with the most important thing in my life- my children. Her front office is fine- it may not have the crazy colors and ""wow"" factors that some have but that is not how I judge a doctor. Dr. Stoerner has had significant training- I think she may be a neonatologist- and there is no doubt that your children are receiving the best care. Other physicians in the area know Dr. Stoerner and have great praise for her capabilities. I highly recommend her."

Our appt was nearly 30 minutes late and we only saw one other child in the office that morning. The whole place could benefit from a little more communication. When the appt was finished, we waited 15 more minutes before someone came in and said we were free to go. The staff yapped behind the desk and even discussed other patients while we waited."

They are a little dry but I care more about knowledge and care received from the doctor more than ambiance! Both my kiddos go there and they love Dr. Stoerner! Dr. Stoerner is very thorough and as far as we're concerned one of the BEST!

The doctor and the staff would never even smile at the patients. This is supposed to be a pediatrician's office but has the worst ambience in terms of office space, people skills and interaction. When we moved to Sugar land we took someone's recommendation for Joan Stoerner as our child's pediatrician...We have stuck with her for 3 months hoping the relationship would get better but we still feel worse after every visit. The doctor is very opinionated and extremely unfriendly."

She is so totally opposite of everything that was said. People are very much in title to there opinion but I will honestly have to 100&#037; disagree not only me my husband also with this comment left about Dr. HIRSCH. She is an amazing doctor genuinely sweet down to earth person. She cares and if there is a concern she does takes all necessary steps to get to the bottom of it. If its lab work needed or a specialist needed she makes sure its done. I have a 5yr old and a 2yr old and from day one there 1st doctor visit at 2weeks old was with Dr.Hirsch. I had a issue a few times with both my boys were I needed to see a specialist and Dr.Hirsch sent me to a great doctor(Dr. Bloss). My 5yr old needed speech to help him Dr.Hirsch recommend him to a great program (eci) that helped him out ALOT. Dr.Hirsch is very educated in her field and WE JUST LOVE HER I WOULD highly recommend her."

He's a nice guy, very knowledgeable, but I rarely feel like he wants to take his time and hear my concerns/comments. It's like they want patients in and out quickly. We're money rather than patients/people. He is getting better though. I was about ready to switch doctors."

My child has diabetes type 1 and Dr. McClure insisted my child did not. She showed to much cleavage her finger nail polish was chipped and her hair was a mess. She wore a horrible body spray to cover up the smoke coming off her clothes. It seems dr. Meghan McClure was only interested in her cell phone than my childs well being. I would never take my kid back to her or recommend her to anybody!

He can be a little nonchalant at times, but if you talk to him, get his attention, he will listen and respond accordingly.

I waited 3 hours one day to see him. He did a feces of my son because he had diarrhea for a week and it's been over a month and I'm still waiting for the results. My son started with the diarrhea again and I'm having to find another doctor to take him to... I do not recommend him at all if he was the last doctor on this earth. His staff are all careless of the patients needs especially one of his nurses.

Two of my children (3 y/o twins) see him regularly. I have never heard a critical or condescending remark. The only critical remark than I would make is that he is in too much of a hurry.

Dr. Salmeron is, by far, the most thorough, caring, and compassionate pediatrician I have ever used. I think what I like most about her, is that she speaks to the patient, not to the parent. She always makes my child feel at ease, and he can speak with her with a level of comfort that I find to be amazing. I will NEVER use anyone else!!"
478,Dr. Marie Salmeron,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Male,4,3.81,2009-01-22T23:08:24Z,4.8,5,5,4,5,"Sometimes you do have to wait to see her, but she is an awesome Dr. She has seen my daughter since she was 18 months old and my son since he was born. She knows who my kids are when they come see her, she knows thier history and always has the correct dignosis as to what is wrong with them. I don't know many Dr's offices that you don't have to wait when you go. If you can get over the wait, Dr. Salmeron is truly a great Dr. who really cares about her patients."
479,Dr. Marie Salmeron,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Male,4,3.81,2006-01-04T00:00:00Z,2.7,,2,1,5,"She is overbooked and we have always had to wait at least 40 min to over an hour to be seen. The last time I was there for my baby's wellness exam, after almost an hour wait, she did the physical checkup and then said she had a lot of sick children to get to and ask me to call the triage nurse for to have my questions answered. Well, when I do call the nurse for questions, EVERY SINGLE TIME she asks me to make an appt and come in to speak with the doc.DO NOT RECOMMEND!"

No matter how busy she is, I can always feel comfortable with asking her any questions that I feel are needed.

He plays with him, tries to make him comfortable and he remembers his patients very well.. And ask us if we had any questions and answer them. If we didn't understand something he'd explain it to us, and most importantly he never judged us or told us we were doing something wrong. He's a very nice, smart, and professional doctor. I'd recommend him to anyone, you'd be lucky to have him as you're children's pediatrician. Thank you Dr. Puranik for encouraging me as a mother, and not putting me down as others did."

She is also very knowledgeable, intelligent, and is one of those rare-breeds of pediatricians that does more than offer lip service to the notion that the doctor is a partner with the parent (not a dictator or un-caring boss) when it comes to a child's healthcare. Highly recommended!"
504,Dr. Lakshmi V. Atkuri,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,1,5,2008-07-29T20:13:41Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Excellent pediatrician! She's like family. She cares for both the child, and the parents and makes everyone feel at ease. She goes above and beyond to make sure you and your child are well cared for.

I have been in her office while she had a thousand patients and she was still very thorough with my daughters diagnoses and approached us with warmth and compassion.

510,Dr. Michelle Shuman,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,3,4.5,2010-12-16T15:31:22Z,5,5,5,5,5,Dr. Shuman is not very polite if you have to call her after hours.

511,Dr. Molly E. Hammond,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Male,3,4.67,2009-10-23T08:59:41Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Hammond is the BEST pediatrician I have ever been to. My son was very sick as a baby until he was almost 3 years old with various things. I don't remember how I found Dr. Hammond, but since my son was 2 (he is 12 now) she has been his Dr., I can count atleast 12 doctors I saw before that could NEVER help my son. From the first time she saw him she told me what was wrong, got him treated and he has been well since. She has NEVER been wrong about a diagnosis, never given my son anything without being 100% thorough with his exam and is always absolutely delightful. She will spend as much time in the office with you as you need and never acts like she is in a hurry to get out of there. I LOVE THIS DOCTOR! If you, or anyone you know are needing a pedi., she is the best choice. I promise you will never be sorry you chose her. The nurses and staff are also wonderful. There is a limit to the characters you can write here or I would go on all day!"

Super friendly guy, his office is EXTREMELY good about returning worried parent calls. Our son fell off the bed and onto our stained concrete floor - we got an emergency appointment right away...can't ask for more than that. One criticism: some (not all) of the office staff can be a bit snitty, e.g. my wife was running 10 minutes late and called ahead to let them know; the receptionist was kind of rude about it when she arrived. No matter, we go to see the doctor not the receptionist. You can trust Dr. Pielop with your kids, we do."

His care has been thorough and accurate and his examinations complete, friendly, and professional. He has a wonderful rapport with my kids and seeks their comments about how they feel without being condescending. We've never waited more than about 10-15 minutes in the waiting room, and perhaps 10 or 15 more before he cheerfully pops into the examing room. He has laboratory and x-ray on site and has expertly stitched up my kids' busted chin and cut foot without sending us to the emergency room at the hospital. I recommend Dr. Morris without reservation."

He is very thorough and has a good rapport with my kids and myself. They have a lab and x-ray onsite so you get most results withing minutes. Years ago, my older son woke up with an earache on Christmas Day. I called the answering service and within minutes the doctor called me back and sent an Rx for him to a 24-hour pharmacy. How often do you hear of such concern these days? My only regret is that my boys will 'outgrow' them in a few years!"
547,Dr. Charlotte Zuniga,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Male,4,4.25,2006-12-15T09:52:37Z,3,,1,3,5,"Dr. Zuniga is a great doctor! She is kind and although not typically effusive, she is a superb diagnostician. My daughters love her and we trust her knowledge even when she says ""I don't know"". This usually means she will find the answer. It takes a long time to get in with her, but she is worth the wait."
548,Dr. Charlotte Zuniga,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Male,4,4.25,2005-02-25T12:29:56Z,5,,5,5,5,"Dr. Zuniga is hit or miss. If you come in with specific questions, she will give you specific answers, but she doesn't care to take time to inform or explain things to you otherwise. She's also made a few careless decisions with our children that have caused us to stop going to her. For example, we have a newborn who had high bilirubin levels (jaundice) and she told us to come back in a month and see if it got any better. She didn't even give us a photo blanket to use at home (which every other doctor we spoke to said they would have done without a second thought). There were other incidents too. All in all, she is not terrible, but you can easily find a better pediatrician."
549,Dr. Charlotte Zuniga,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Male,4,4.25,2017-08-09T11:41:51.461Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Knowledgeable and thorough with your baby. Answers alot of questions, gives excellent advice. If it weren't for her, I probably would have missed the boat on breastfeeding my first baby. Efficiently operated office; seldom late or hurried."
550,Dr. Charlotte Zuniga,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Male,4,4.25,2005-02-21T20:49:32Z,4.7,,4,5,5,"She looks young, but she is very smart and knowledgeable. She is very down to earth and no nonsense. She is not arrogant at all. She talks to you ""mom to mom."" She is a mother herself."

She has caught so many things with my children that were followed up by other specialists. She caught a possible viral infection in my son consulted with other physicians in the office and admitted him. She may spend not much time with you for well visits but come prepared with questions and she will answer them. She remembers my children even though we come in once a year. I will not go anywhere else and I drive in from Angleton and now Sugar Land TX.
552,Dr. Jackie E. Wanebo,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Male,2,3.75,2010-05-17T11:20:54Z,5,5,5,5,5,"You don't even want to go to this doctor. I had my preemie baby's first doctor visit with her and it was like a fast food experience. She barely spent 5 minutes with my daughter . We felt rushed and not really attended to. I was still asking questions, but she was already walking towards the door. Horrible! Don't trust her with your child!"
553,Dr. Pamela Mcgraw,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,6,2.75,2013-05-19T08:51:35Z,4.5,4,4,5,5,"Dr. McGraw is a great pediatrician who really listens to me. When my son was an infant, I had the suspicion that he was not getting enough milk from breast feeding. In the hospital I talked to my doctor, every nurse, and two lactation consultants about these concerns, and every single one of them brushed it off and said he looked fine. My first appointment with Dr. McGraw, she took my concerns very seriously and did some lab work that confirmed my suspicions that he was not getting enough milk. She spent over half an hour talking with us about how breast feeding was going, different strategies we could try, how to pump and how to increase my supply, and finally she helped us make the very difficult decision to switch to formula as none of these things were working. I truly believe she saved my son’s life by listening to everything I had to say and taking my concerns seriously, when no one else would. She never judged me or made me feel guilty in any way for not being able to breast feed. I feel very supported by her. "
554,Dr. Pamela Mcgraw,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,6,2.75,2008-03-04T15:34:00Z,3,4,2,3,3,"She was dismissive and this caused us to not get the services we needed in a timely manner. She didn't address the problems we can into the office for. When she talked to me about my child she was a bit condescending, even if it was in a very nice tone of voice. "
555,Dr. Pamela Mcgraw,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,6,2.75,2005-12-15T14:44:24Z,5,,5,5,5,Terrible. I had scoliosis and untreated for so many years till I was 20 by going to a REAL doctor to tell me I had scoliosis. McGraw always said one leg was bigger than the other but that wasn't the case.
556,Dr. Pamela Mcgraw,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,6,2.75,2005-07-20T05:32:18Z,5,,5,5,5,"Dr. McGraw was my son's doctor. We had to change her due to her being always in a hurry. She is always late, when she spends no more than 5 minutes and runs away. She never asked any questions by herself. And as a first time mom you want to make sure that your baby is fine and develops fine. All she does just ruting checks and presribs antibiotics for everything. Very busy office."

She hardly looked at my child, preferring to talk down to me (the mother) the whole time. She was outrageous and I would avoid this entire practice. The nurses and doctors are hurried, no one even takes time to say hello and smiles are rare. You feel like you are a number - a client to help them make more money. Awful and sad!"

He is 9 now and Dr. McGraw takes the time to explain issues, educate us and allows us to ask a million questions without appearing as though we are bothering her. The office is clean and staff is friendly. Janice, her nurse, is the BEST! I highly recommend Dr. McGraw."

My other son is 10 months old, and I wouldn't trust anyone else to care for my newborn and wonderful baby of 10 months. She is very up to date on all medical trends and strains of viruses. She REALLY listens and uses scientific knowledge with patient compassion. She is so warm and caring, yet so detail oriented. I would highly recommend her to any parent who wants their child to have an outstanding pediatrician. They are welcome to call me for a reference. 713-898-0828."

Technical ability is obviously very good. Bedside manner is excellent and follow-up care was sensitive and helpful. Follow-up visits were handled by his residents but he seemed available if we had detailed questions. Dr. Hines is highly recommended."

I usually would check ratings on any doctor but my son's one week check was due and I had no choice. When we first met Dr. Monroy, She was great. She introduced herself to us and asked if we had any concerns about our son before she examined him. She was very informative and shows how much she cares about her patients. She is very easy to talk to and her staff is wonderful."

Compared to other practitioners, Dr. Schwanecke truly takes the time to counsel her patients. She provides family with valuable health education about nutrition, exercise, and safety in addition to addressing their medical concerns. I believe this is a huge aspect of primary care that often gets dismissed because of the increasing demand to see more and more patients every day, but Dr. Schwanecke continues makes it a priority. I was also impressed by how many of Dr. Schwanecke’s patients were children or even grandchildren of previous patients. I believe that is a true testament to the wonderful care she provides. "
573,Dr. Rebecca P. Schwanecke,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,6,2.67,2011-03-02T22:26:56Z,4.8,5,4,5,5,"I have never had anything but the best experiences with this doctor's office. The wait is longer than before, yes, but not because the staff or doctor are incompetent or less thorough! It is because ALL medical offices are now having to switch to electronic medical records, which takes MORE time than before to deal with! More time must be spent on the computer, therefore less time with the patients! (I speak from experience because I work in a medical office.) I challenge you to find a doctor's office where this is not true. The only difference is that other offices either see fewer patients, or don't accept all insurance plans, or have a large staff of people to do the computer work for them. But this doctor's experience in primary care and her accessibility far outweigh any negatives listed here. The fact that she is so experienced allows her to quickly and efficiently diagnose what is wrong in a shorter amount of time. Plus, any time I've had a problem, the staff and the doctor were always more than willing to listen and to help me find a solution, whether it's an insurance issue, a sick child over the weekend, or anything else I might need. It is a smaller office with only one physician, so those looking for a 5 minute wait will be disappointed. But those looking for a caring, experienced healthcare professional will be pleased, as long as you follow the doctor's orders! I also find the new office very convenient, clean, and comfortable overall, a huge improvement over the old location."
574,Dr. Rebecca P. Schwanecke,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,6,2.67,2008-04-10T23:14:48Z,4.8,5,4,5,5,"So glad they finally got rid of Stephanie , she was horrible.. Still the staff is just horrible as well.. Wait is way too long!"

Schwanecke,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Male,6,2.67,2011-03-17T16:09:06Z,4.8,5,4,5,5,"Dr. Schwanecke was my pediatrician from the time I was born until I was 18, so it seemed logical to take my son to her as well. The head receptionist has been here for as long as I can remember, and it seems customer service has become a minimal concern for her as she is often rude and doesn't even acknowledge patients. When I brought my son to Dr. Schwanecke for the first time, she actually asked me how I found out about her and didn't even realize I had been her patient for 18 years. She seems to prescribe medicines and diagnose problems without really examining all the possibilities and I really take what she says with a grain of salt. I only trust this office to administer vaccinations, not telling me what is wrong when my child is sick. I don't think she doesn't have the knowledge, I just think she is not thorough anymore. This is an office I have dealt with for nearly 25 years and I'm disappointed in what it has become."

My son had horrible ear infections and had to constantly keep coming back she would always just give him antiobiotic for 7 years weve been going and the same antibiotic finally I went in when another doctor was filling in for doctor Kamdar and when I explained everything looked confused and said that after 7 ear infections its a must to be referred to a specialist and that after so long of using an antibiotic it stops working! She referred me to a specialist fianlly. She gave me a number where I can report her.i forgot to mention she yelled at the nurse for letting me wait in lobby. She threw a paper on her face the poor girl'understaffed she only had that one girl do whole back and 1 front desk My som os finally seen after 7 years

I waited for 4 hrs in the waiting room before even being seen.. then once in the exam room i noticed that there was no soap in the room to even wash your hands.. what kind of place is this?? when the doctor came in she did not even wash her hands before putting on gloves and touching my child but then again how could she when there were no soap dispensers in the room!!! you are dealing with sick children all day and everyone knows that you have to wash your hands to prevent from spreding germs. This place is a disgrace i do not know how they passed their state regulations. will NOT use this doctor again. Its a shame you cant even find a good doctor now days

Kamdar,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,12,2.23,2010-04-07T12:58:18Z,1.8,2,3,1,1,"We were pretty nervous to take our 2-year-old to see Dr Kamdar based on the reviews I read here. But we just received Medicaid and she was able to see our sick son the soonest. We arrived 30 minutes early to fill out paperwork. The waiting room was packed at 9:30 but sure enough, I finished the paperwork at 9:50 and they called us back at 10:05. We waited until 10:35 when the Nurse Practitioner came in followed by the doctor at 11:05. She was very soft with our son and answered all our questions with patience. We were very satisfied with her. The office is a bit older but NOT dirty, just old and a bit beat up from years of service. Several people who were there before us were still waiting when we left so maybe they were walk ins. Most likely calling ahead made the difference in a longer wait time but nowhere near 3 hours. We are bringing our son back here for a checkup in a week."

When he was 3 months old she put him on a diet because she said he was too heavy! The wait time with an appointment is ALWAYS over an hour. When i make appointments for 9am (when the office opens) i always end up waiting outside until 9:15 until someone comes to unlock the door. She seems to be a little more helpful but that may just be because he's healthy. One time when he was due for shots they didnt have one he needed and i had to bring him back a week later when they got it. She isn't gentle with him and even admitted to being too rough. She is hard to understand,a nd sometimes i worry that she doesnt understand my questions or concerns."

Both times i only waited a few minutes in the waiting room and probably about 20 minutes at the most in the exam room. Dr. Kamdar seemed very knowledgeable and was very caring for our daughter. She always has helpful tips and makes sure all of our questions are answered. she is a sweet lasy and i dont agree with the other ratings. No the office isnt as nice as other offices ,but it is decent. They have a large waiting room with plenty of seating and a tv to keep you and your children entertained. So far no problems."

This place is horrific the doctor barely speak english and can hardly communicate with me. My daughter has been battling a horrible diaper rash of some sort and the meds they prescribed have made her worse. I went back the falling week and told her to prescribe something different (keep in mind I have no insurance so there was a 40.00 dr visit both times)! I went to fill the prescription and it was the same exact thing I spent another 35.00 on something I already had and does not work! I called to complain and let her know she prescribed me the samething and was left on hold for 45 mins then switched to a operator.I also waited 5 hrs to see the doctor since I was a walk-in when returning. This place is ridiculus unless u want to wait 5-6 hrs to see a doc (without appt) 3-4 with an appt. I would not recommend this place unless it was an absolute emergency. Thanks for absolutely nothing!
588,Dr. Hung Lam,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,4,2.88,2010-09-29T08:32:11Z,1.8,2,1,2,2,"This is my first time ever writing a review, but I feel I need to. My son has seen Dr. Lam since he was a newborn and is about to turn 2. Every appointment we went to Dr. Lam said his right ear looked like it was borderline infected to keep an eye out for other symptoms and would prescribe an antibiotic. My son rarely ever showed any other symptoms so I didn't give him the antibiotics. My motherly instinct kicked in and called the nurses to request a referral to an ENT to get a second opinion about his ear. She called me back and told me that Dr. Lam said no. Uhm what? He can't refuse a referral. What did he have to gain or lose by giving me a referral? The nurse was even confused about why he wouldn't give it to me. So I told her to tell him that he can't refuse me. Dr. Lam called me back personally and told me I was wasting my time and they wouldn't give him tubes b/c he hasn't had enough ear infections. I told him he couldn't refuse me and it wasn't my fault that he didn't note it in his charts that he tells me every time we're there that his ear is irritated. Turns out, my son had fluid sitting on his ear for who knows how long and already had hearing damage. He had tubes a month later and doing great. Just b/c the fluid wasn't infected didn't mean that the fluid was causing him harm. Dr. Lam lost a patient for sure.
"
589,Dr. Hung Lam,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,4,2.88,2010-01-29T21:04:40Z,4.5,5,3,5,5,"We saw Doctor Lam at the Texas Children's after hours clinic. I took my daughter to the after hours clinic as it was part of the Texas Children's network that my daughter's primary doctor is part of. The nurse was friendly and efficient; however, I was very turned off by Doctor Lam. When he entered the room, he briskly introduced himself and then went to the sink to wash his fingers. I say ""fingers"" as he did not fully soap his hands. He just put a quick dab on his fingers, rubbed them quickly and rinsed them. Then he used his clean fingers to turn off the dirty faucet. I told him about my daughter's symptoms which were fever of 104, chills, aches, chest pain, trouble breathing, coughing, headache, and stuffy nose. He looked at her throat, looked in her ears, and listened to her breathe once on the front and once on the back. He did not listen to her lungs on the side of her body that she said hurt. He did not check her lymph nodes, nor did he check her nostrils until I asked him to. His exam lasted less than three minutes of which the majority of his time was spent typing his notes on the computer. His solution was to prescribe Tamiflu even though the flu test was negative. I told him about my other son having pneumonia a few weeks earlier and would have expected him to have spent a little more time listening to her lungs. Now I will have to take her to her Primary care doctor to have her examined again as I have no confidence in Doctor Lam and his 3 minute exam. He needs to find a new profession as the care he shows his patients is pitiful. Texas Children's needs to drop him from their network!"
590,Dr. Hung Lam,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,4,2.88,2009-10-08T12:38:32Z,3.8,3,2,5,5,Dr.Lam has very POOR bedside manners! I was very disappointed in him. I WILL NEVER BRING MY BABY BACK TO HIM. The NURSES are more educated than he is. He didn't know what he was talking about when it came to observing my child. Its like he didn't care! DO NOT go to him!
591,Dr. Hung Lam,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,4,2.88,2009-07-15T12:41:56Z,2.5,3,1,3,3,Dr. Lam has been great with my daughter. He listens to everything I say about her and checks everything out that I request.

Usually if he doesn't know the answer to something, he will say ""I don't know, let me get back to you."" I recomend Dr. Spinner and his office to everyone I know with children. He always takes the time to put my kids at ease. When my daughter goes in for anything he always shows her on her doll first. He does have a very busy office, but what little wait there is is always worth it. He is the BEST pediatrician I know"

Continued to drug my son with injections that caused him to be very ill. The best medicine for my son ended up being EXCERCISE! Kamdar is basically an over reacting, medication happy doctor. I would NOT recommend him. He is very knowledgeable to a DANGEROUS level. Takes a basic phyiscal exam and then diagnosis a severe condition...off of ONE VISIT."

My son was sick for a few days with a stomach bug and suffered a knee injury from football. She gladly fit him in her busy schedule and explained everything to him clearly. Afterwards, my son commented on how nice and patient she was. I am grateful that she is my doctor and would always recommend her -I have the highest regard for Dr. Ziegler!"

It seems to me they lack customer service and organization skills. At least Dr. J is great and that is what matters the most to me. I'm very happy that my daughter is in great hands with Dr. Jasani! A+ for this doctor.

She does not act arrogant as some doctors of her status often do. She loves the babies and it shows. She's dedicated her life to research, neonatal, and is the doctor at TCH to have on your side. Now if I could just get her to move to a hospital closer to my home than 5 hours!!! We love her!"

Thanks to him the 3rd time worked and I have my beautiful daughter. He is very knowledgable about the process and is up to speed on new technology etc. around fertility. He is a perfectionist. The only feedback about the office is the financial counselor is a slacker.

I truly felt that he wanted to help put my mind at ease. I liked the fact that he asked for my input when deciding on what to do unlike others that dictate what needs to be done and treat you like you don't exist or like the child is not yours. For someone very young he surprised me with his knowledge and manners. Tough to find an appointment with him though.

Dr. Wilking was given to our family by the hospital as our pediatrician when my son was born in 2003. She and I didn't always agree. She didn't have the warm fuzzy manner of some pediatricians. She could be dismissive, with a deep furrow in her brow from thinking. But, she is a brilliant clinician. She paid attention to what I was saying and had me clarify, though I felt insecure and was probably being vague. When my husband lost his job, and we were between coverage, and wouldn't likely qualify for any aid programs, she just....comped us several sick child visits, though I had only asked for some sort of discount. And, when my daughter was born very prematurely, she rounded her in the NICU almost every morning, checking on her and consulting with the head neonatologist. Looking at the bills later - she was barely paid for this. Her presence was very reassuring. She took excellent care of us. Without a lot of warm fuzzies, but with genuine concern and intelligence. She was an excellent pediatrician. We miss her."
614,Dr. Marilyn Wilking,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,5,3.77,2011-12-15T12:51:22Z,4.5,4,4,5,5,"Horrible communicator, made me feel inadequate and like a bad mother when I had trouble with breastfeeding. Consistently waited 45 mins+ to see doctor and then felt like she didn't take the time to listen to my concerns or explain anything. My child is 8 weeks and I will be finding a new pediatrician asap. Nurses also seemed unwilling to take the time to answer our questions and front desk is rude! Dr. Wilking is probably knowledgeable, but doesn't take the time to gather all the information needed to assess the situation. People I met with later (lactation consultants) listened to the details and helped me get on track rather than talking down to me."
615,Dr. Marilyn Wilking,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Male,5,3.77,2008-05-05T16:07:29Z,4.5,4,4,5,5,Gives patients & families all the time they need...consequently is always running late. But this is better than the inverse.
616,Dr. Marilyn Wilking,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Male,5,3.77,2009-12-09T22:25:37Z,4.5,3,5,5,5,"Dr. Wilking is very nice and takes her time with the patient. Helpful, caring, and knows her stuff! She called my house to check on how I was doing after I had a procedure. Knows how to talk to both the child and parent. I saw her for many years until I turned 18. She is probably my favorite doctor, and I have seen many."

619,Dr. Joyce Yue,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,2,3.38,2014-09-22T17:42:10.194Z,5,5,5,5,5,We have had both our kids coming to this office before Dr. Yue took over office. Her office staff is slow and not resourceful. Typical wait time is well over an hour and when you ask appt desk they tell you they are very busy yet an hour later when they call you in no patients have come out so how we're they busy. I am here today and been here for 75 minutes so far. Only one patient was in the waiting rooms but again they said they were busy then all of a sudden they call in 4 patients. So what happened to their full waiting rooms. The Dr is relatively new and she is still in her learning stages. Seems like now she takes on more medcaid patients and just told me that the offices are under staffed. She is nice person to speak with however the overall quality of card from this facility is not up to previous care given. It seems the owners of this clinic are not in tune with patient care instead of making this a money making operation. I am highly dissatisfied with this clinic.

She is a wonderful person and a great doctor!!!"
624,Dr. Joanie Hare,Land,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,2,3.25,2017-06-10T19:57:31.022Z,5,5,5,5,5,She has no compassion and does not listen. She does not look through your charts to examine your medical history or concerns. She does not listen but concerned eith her own agenda. Does not understand every patient is different and categorizes you with all of her other patients. Do not go to her.
625,Dr. Richard L. Byrd,Land,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,1,4.25,2013-07-01T11:24:13Z,1.8,1,1,2,3,Very Good doctor. Impressed by his service attitude and his vast experience
626,Dr. Rhonda Smith,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,1,4.25,2012-08-16T12:48:38Z,3,3,3,3,3,"Dr. Rhonda Smith is the best Pediatrician I have ever taken my four children to. I started taking my son to her in 1990. I was concerned that his pediatrician was missing a diagnosis. She asked lots of questions and wanted to know what I suspected. I wasn't sure, but just told her he wasn't eating right or breathing well. She listened to his chest, took an xray and within 15 minutes, diagnosed pneumonia. What would have happened had he not seen her? So glad we found her. She is thorough, kind, and knowledgeable. While very hands on, she also lets the parent be in charge of the child's health care. She directs and you decide. She took care of my premature daughter from the hospital until she got through her difficult times. Now, she's a happy and healthy child who hasn't had to see the Dr. in ages. My older children continued seeing her until they reached college age. They were very upset when Dr. Smith told them they needed to see a GP. They just weren't children any longer!"

628,Dr. Ambreen Aslam,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,4,2.69,2012-09-02T10:40:16Z,4.3,2,5,5,5,The whole staff here is rude. I was going here for about two years and always got terrible service. Ive always made it to my appointments early and had to wait over to hours to get the most rude doctor ive come across. Dr.ambreen aslam is a joke she does not care about the children and shes always in and out and then tries to make the parent feel like crud for whatever is wrong with the child. This last time I went to get staples removed and I informed her I was changing doctors because of the rude staff and she got ugly with me. The minute I told her hiw rude she was being and I would report her she tells me lets be human here. I then refused service becuase I wasnt having someone as unprofessional as her touch my child. So then I get a letter saying they are terminating my child as a patient because I was unprofessional. Excuse me for one I made the decision to move alread and two an upset crying parent is inprofessional and treated like crud. These drs dont care about the kids and shouldnt be in business. I wish I that someone would investigate because they are horrid.
629,Dr. Ambreen Aslam,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,4,2.69,2010-01-26T13:53:46Z,4.3,5,2,5,5,"The wait is usually quick in the mornings and I usually get a same day appointment for a sick visit. BUT it is HORRIBLE when there is only one provider at the practice. I was actually there for two whole hours with a very sick child which is very frustrating and made me change practice. Dr.Aslam is very quick with each visit. Seems like she is always in a hurry. I do feel very rush as she only spends about no more than 5 minutes each time we see her (hardly looks at you while speaking). Also, my child was suffering from acid reflux and she only gave us TWO options, to began on rice cereal in the bottle or medications. I decided on the rice cereal only to later find out there was a spit up formula that could help with that promblem, which she never even mentioned to us (and it worked). That tells me she either doesn't listen well, doesn't care much or not knowledgable enough!!!!"

Turns out there is nothing wrong him and it is just genetics. The way she approached it to me was as if I didn't feed my child and that there had to be something terribly wrong. It seemed as though she was scolding me for it. I've also waited more than an hour on a scheduled appointed time. Dr. Aslam is also a female and not a male."

But they do not have good staff to manage time for patients. The comment above correct about the fat Vietnamese woman in an office. She always talks loud to customers. I She is very rude and not polite to anyone. One day, I took my daughter walking to office, she put is on the waiting list and I waited for 4 hours . I asked her 2 times when i could see doctor because my daughter get high fever. She always answered one word( wait). At the end, she called me and said that doctor could not see my baby. That made me angry and I talked to her I wanted to talk with someone not her. They sent me the other and I talked to her they could not to do with customers like that. Don't let we wait for long time and answer no or this is the rule of doctors. After that, they let me to see Chinese doctor, She is very very good too. I hope doctors read this comment to have enough knowledge to solve this issue in his office"

However, his office staffs, especially the fat woman, which I believe to be related to him somehow is the biggest B.... I know. She is very rude to people, and will treat you bad if you don't speak English or if you don't have coverage. Because the office had 2 doctors, and lot of patients, they don't give a damn about anyone. If you don't have coverage, she will treat you like a piece of s...t. My one year old child had high fever once, and I brough her to see the doctor, we were refused service since the office is full and they wanted to leave on time after all the patients are done seeing the doctors. I had made comment to Dr. Tuan, but he seem to be scare of the B.... I think that is his sister-in-law or something. I believe in Karma, and I hope she will receive the same treatment that she gave people some day. God bless everyone."

She was only concerned about his weight gain. He had more important issues to address but she would not listen to my concerns. She was not confident in her decisions regarding him and had to call and consult with every specialist before she made one. My son was diagnosed with a respiratory virus on another occasion and she was going to prescribe a medication that had a safer alternative for him just to avoid getting the prior authorization from the insurance. She is not confident in her decisions and I am not confident with her taking care of my son. I would not use this doctor."

Was able to work my daughter in quickly for her 3-5 day appointment and was amazing at her one month. However, at her two month I had a big turn. My daughter was sick a few days before her two month and she had some weight loss. That was all she cared about. Didn't truly care about how she was after being sick. Came back a week later to get reweighed and I had a few questions... all she could talk about was how ""great"" her weight was but it still needed improvement. Didn't answer any of my other questions which had nothing to do with her weight. I would not recommend her at all."

The staff was helpful and willing to answer questions if I had any. Dr. Ahad was actually very kind despite the last review she was given. She answered all my questions and gave me informative feedback. Also she seemed thorough when it came to ruling out any possible issues. I did not like the fact her responses did not have absolute statements. I am willing to reschedule another appointment but I am still not 100% about her.

When she did see us she wouldnt listen or answer our questions. She was rude and very unhelpful.

Her angry and hideous receptionist YELLS at people who complain about the tardiness. There is no excuse for this kind of treatment of children who often find it difficult to wait and wait and wait (not to mention their parents' time and often hectic schedules). This doctor's office totally disrespects patients' time and is quite hostile. The doctor herself has zero personality and has a flat affect. Yuk!"

No one knows more than her, she makes you feel stupid and ignorant. Never lets you finish one single sentence. We have been going to her for about 6 months, only seen her 3 times within this period becabecause we haven't found another doctor. During this whole time, vshe NEVER interacted with my son, all she does is take notes on the computer. Time is valuable and we need someone who will help us not make us feel helpless! STAY AWAY from this lady who cares nothing about anyone!"

She did not converse with the attendees in the room before making an assessment. 3. Was busy evaluating child number 2 when I was there for child number 1. 4. Didn't not listen. 5. Insulted my child's intelligence and suggested that I should find another speech pathologist because there was ""No way he could have reached these milestones."""

She found something on my child's newborn follow up appointment that the hospital did not! She takes her time with the child, answers your questions and never makes you feel rushed. The staff there is great BUT I will be changing pedi's since the office runs terribly SLOW when there is only one provider. And when I tried calling after hours for advice on my sick child and another answering company answers the calls and tells me they cannot find no doctor for that practice. Very unconvenient for when you need to contact the doctor for urgent advice or questions."

Powells,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Female,3,2.5,2012-08-29T21:34:26Z,2.3,4,3,1,1,"We gave this doc a low rating because of all of the ped docs and ped specialists we've used over the years, her office has been the worst. We were referred to her because she did the newborn checkup for an infant that CPS had taken custody of and who was now in our care. The office was bare, there was not enough seating, and the wait was excessively long. We felt Dr. Powell was a decent doctor, but we found her staff snippy and sometimes rude. After two visits, we decided it would be better to pay cash and go to another doctor rather than use the CPS-provided Medicaid with this one. Later, when we needed the shot records for this child we couldn't get them. Our new doctor requested them twice and received no response. We called around 8 times over 2 months to request them ourselves. We were put on hold for up 17 minutes at a time and then told to leave a message and wait to have the call returned. No calls were ever returned and we still have no records."

After he did he realized that we were right. He also tried to speak ""above my head."" Once he did consult with my child's specialist though he agreed and opened his mind. Keep in mind that my child was born with a chromosomal deletion, 22Q11.2 deletion syndrome, so her mornal stats are different than other children. I have spoken with other PICU doctors in my area that do speak well of him so maybe our experience, with a special needs childwas not his normal care. He did take care of my baby girl in an emergency situation and did no harm, although by calling her specialist earlier he may have saved some time and taxpayer money."

But I hate that I had to wait an hour in the the waiting room, once the nurse called me to the back it was usually another 30-45 minute wait! Then the first time my son got sick it seemed like Dr plumb was disregarding my concerns about my son. he had fever and ear aches that would not go away. Then he got pink eye and all of dr plumbs instructions were very unclear and no notes for me to take home or what to do it it persisted. My son continued to be sick for almost 2.5 months with fever and cough and ear aches. So I finally took him to another pediatrician and she did a lung x-ray and told me he had Pneumonitis and gave him son medicine that clear up his ear ache in 5 days flat!! He had the earache for 3 weeks and Dr plumb told me to wait another week before he would prescribe another anitbiotic. I really feel he is too old to be practicing.Be wise and choose another doctor.It would have saved me 6 visits!"

Each time she prescribes him nothing, recommends a bunch of over-the-counter crap and sends me on my way. If you are into paying a copay to have nothing done, this is the pediatrician for you! She will tell you things like, ""It will get worse before it gets better"" and ""If this doesn't go away on it's own come back in x amount of days."" (so you can burn another copay to have nothing prescribed) Yes, if you like to burn money, then she's great. 3 days of 101-103 fever for my 4 year old, and she was right, he is getting worse. Probably because she flat out REFUSED to prescribe antibiotics. I know my child. I brought him to a doctor because I knew how sick he was about to become. Now, it is 3 days later and yep, with no kind of professional treatment he has gotten worse. She really knows her stuff! Two BIG thumbs down for the glorified witch doctor."
666,Dr. Diana S. Hellman,Houston,Texas,Pediatrician, Male,1,3,2014-07-09T12:16:10Z,4.8,5,4,5,5,This doctor was rude and not helpful at all!

The staff is a bit stiff and uptight, not very friendly. The waiting isn't so bad on most occasions, but I once waiting over an hour just so they could tell me my son had a cold and sent me home. The Dr is very cold, she doesn't really try to interact with you, much less my child. I personally feel that if your job consist of sticking cute little babies with needles, at least try to comfort them. She just says what she thinks and walks out, leaving you with a list of questions, and if you dare ask those questions she makes you feel like you're bothering her. Really would NOT RECOMMEND this doctor to anyone. Don't waste your time."

They will make you pay the full amount regardless if you have insurance or not, then makes all kinds of excuses not to refund the payment even though they received the insurance claims.

As a result, my insurance company refused to pay fully for the out-of-network bill and that was passed to me. I filed an appeal to the provider and was rejected. I argued with the staff and she offered a 50&#037; discount, which is still a lot of money. My insurance company told me it would be much less if it was in-network. At the second time, a staff warned me that if I don't pay the 50&#037; of the original bill and she will ask a third agency to force me to pay the full bill. First, I think as a customer I shall not suffer from the out-of-network costs(nobody told me the doctor is out-of-network at that time). Second it is extremely uncomfortable to hear someone which used the phrase ""I warn you..."" to the customer. I accepted the fact and payed the bill. But I will not recommend the service to anyone."

I finally decided to find another pediatrician. My reasons- while at appt.'s the Dr. will ask me (mom) what antibiotic I think will work????? That's why we are here, for her knowledge! Dr. Eisner's yearly exams are poor. Has never been thourough. Her staff is the most unprofessional group. Several years ago I referred a family to this practice, they went once and told me they would not go back. They were unhappy with Dr. Eisner's entire office experience. They felt everyone was rude and the Dr. was ""stand-offish"" to their children. I would NOT reccomend Dr. Eisner. So mant great pediatricians in the Houston area, no reason to go here."

He was arrogant, dismissive, and worse, did not do a physical exam of our child before making a snap diagnosis that directly contradicted his colleagues' far more serious diagnosis. He changed the treatment course in the middle and we were left confused and feeling very lost. Dr. Malatack's diagnosis ended up being wrong and proven so by the bloodwork he did not order (despite our requests) until we were conveniently being discharged. I just thank God for the first doctor who was able to treat our very sick child for 2 days before we were turned over to this ego-ridden man who has lost touch with his patients and who seemed instead to be ""performing"" for his residents (fan club). I pray we never cross paths again."

The wait even if you have an appt. is usually one to two hours. The staff never knows what is going on and tend to ignore you when you have a question for them. When you call in for an appt. or question, you are usually put on hold for a long period of time.

I had to call the office several times for a doctor's order to be issued & sent to a hospital in a two week period for my mother's routine annual mammogram! Thank God she didn't have to deal with their uncaring snide attitude and it makes me feel bad for other elders that may get this bad treatment. As for Doctor Molina the few times my mother has seen her, she felt her concerns were ignored by the doctor & attending nurse. Hopefully the negativity of this practice will change soon.

This was not a new issue for us as my daughter had been on the meds for years. I called them out on the upcharge because it should have been a $100 visit (we have a $2000 deductible to meet first) and they would not fix it. I filed an insurance fraud claim with my insurance in which they found that WE WERE UPCHARGED for a lengthy appt. instead of a med refill and they were forced to fix the issue. Just today I received a dismissal letter from the office dismissing my daughter as a patient. I guess they don't want someone that knows what they are doing to be a patient of theirs.Dr. Molina wrote my daughter the wrong prescription and I didn't find out until we were at the pharmacy.She charged me $25 to re-write a new script!

I tell her medical assistant that I still had questions and the doc said she was coming back. Her response: ""dr has left."" I ask for clarification as to whether the dr has left for the day. ""No, she is with another patient and won't be back"". I inquire about waiting and the rude assistant gives me the bs line of ""I will make a note in your file so the dr can call you"".

They tried to give one of my children more immunizations when I knew she did not need them (she already had them) they were just not reading her records properly. If you have the option do not use this doctor. The front office staff is the rudest and nastiest people ever, the doctor seems cold, and the office itself feels disgusting (dirty).

The whole office is ran poorly. No one ever had a clue what was going on! We are in the process of switching to Texas Children's.

She made medical decisions based on ""policy"" rather than actual medical knowledge. We will be curious to discover how she billed her services to the 3rd party payor."

706,Dr. John B. Darby,Houston,Texas,, Male,1,1.75,2007-12-28T11:56:59Z,2.3,2,4,1,2,"The infections diseases group at Texas Children Hospital misdiagnosed my daughter with Kawasaki disease when she had pheumonia. As the main physician, even though he says he doesn't see symptoms of Kawasaki disease he caved under the Infections Disease group and didn't stand by his opinion. We were in the Texas children hospital for 10 day under the wrong treatment and by the time they found out they were wrong, my daughter's pheumonia was already so bad that we had to have surgery to drain her lung. We ended up in the hospital for 3 weeks. Very painful experience for me to see my daughter suffer like that."

708,Dr. Heena N. Thakkar,Houston,Texas,, Female,3,1.33,2015-07-16T18:56:30.723Z,2,1,3,1,3,"Terrible, terrible terrible place: STAY AWAY!!!! After 3 appointments, here is our review
- Staff is rude and un professional, you seem to bother them all the time.
- NEVER on time: We usually were attended 1h45 LATE average, the fastest was 45 minutes late!!! Try to do that with a newborn and a 3y.o in a waiting room packed with people (people had to sit in the hallway). The more people she shoves up the schedule, the more money she gets without caring at all for her patients.
- Waiting room doesn't have any entertainment for kids (play area, TV, etc)
- Dr Thakkar does not seem to care about patients: she comes in, doesn't know your kids name, ask what you are in for (check up, etc) and then perform a 30seconds check up and end up saying everything is normal. IF, IF you dare asking a question, she doesn't listen at all and cuts you off while still talking to say that everything is fine, not to worry and she walks out.
- We needed a form signed for our son's daycare: they had the audacity to ask 25$ for a SIGNATURE!!!! If you have an appointment, it's free, if not, they charge you and you have to pay cash... Very very weird.
Definitely STAY AWAY from that place!!!!!"
709,Dr. Heena N. Thakkar,Houston,Texas,, Female,3,1.33,2014-05-28T15:47:47Z,2,4,2,1,1,"This is by far the worst pediatric office I have ever been to! Not only did the staff open the office late but they were 45 mins behind on the FIRST appt! The front staff was rude and lazy. I had to make the phone calls to my insurance company to verify which is their job and when they wanted to speak with the insurance representative they used my cell phone! While I sat there waiting to get my son seen 2 other patients were called by a very rude and angry looking nurse! I should have read the reviews before going, so hopefully if you are a parent reading this before you go this might help you not waste your gas, money and time!"

I called to see if I had missed my childs appointment and to my own fault I had, I asked the receptionist do they not give courtesy calls and she responded not all the time if we are busy we don't. Each time I've ever been in there besides them eating and talking about the other employees not doing there jobs I can't see them not giving courtesy calls. IJS."

Dr. Vargas refused to listen to me, even after I explained I had not slept in a few days and to be patient. She was rude. My pediatrician spoke to her on the phone to explain the situation. He got a bad feeling from her and supported me on my decisions to leave with my daughter and take her myself to another hospital. The next day my daughter was in ICU. This ""Dr"" should not be working at a children's hospital. Her bedside matter is horrible."
712,Dr. Rosalba E. Vargas,Houston,Texas,, Male,2,1.38,2014-07-25T11:06:05Z,1.8,1,2,2,2,We took our daughter to Texas Children's hospital and unfortunately saw Dr. Vargas.

I waited at the window, where I could see the receptionist talking and glancing at the window where I was standing. After about 3mins, she asked me what I needed. I told here what was wrong, she asked me with what insurance group I was in. I told her I had Amerigroup. She then said the doctor was leaving. I asked her to please ask if he could see my son. she came back after a few mins and said he said no and to make a appt for tomm. I was in shock and asked if anyone esle can look at him. she said no, he is the only doctor to see amerigroup patient. i called plan 1-800 number to speak to a nurse which advised me to take him to hospital, they were stunned also."

I called to see if her regular dr is available and it's not, as expected for last minute call. But Dr. Mulder was available. When she saw her, she was in such a hurry and didn't even want to listen. Putting words in my mouth instead of taking the time to simple listen. I'm not idiot. I read about all these online already. I only went to see the dr for the strep test. She is the WORST doctor I have EVER had to visit. Never again. It is no wonder she is the only doctor is available. Guess she doesn't have a good following!

Dr. Horst always took the time to communicate to my husband and myself and explain my son's condition to us. The experience was unexpected and most of the time we were lost. Dr. Horst is a good person and he really cares about the babies. It was a rough road, many people prayed for my baby and I truly believe that we were blessed to have our baby put into Dr. Horst's care. My son is doing great and I will definitely make sure he knows all about Dr. Horst."

After leaving her, several physicians gave advice contrary to hers and advised a much simpler way of diagnosing what she was proposing to diagnose. So, I feel that she cannot be trusted as a physician - she continued to push the expensive test even after we asked her if there were alternate methods. So, I really have no other choice but to conclude that patient care is not her first priority. It seems her priority lies in justifying all the expensive machinery she has to account for on her floor. She is a shame to doctor's everywhere and the scum of physicians. Any corporation will be embarrassed to employ her and any patient will be severely disappointed."

I knew good and well Dr. Azeemuddin was there, because I had just called an hour earlier and had someone else speak with him. Plus, I could hear his very distinct voice in the background! I was trying to get a refill and kept getting the run around from them for almost a month. Even when I tried to get my pharmacy involved, they said that a lot of people complained about this office. They completely ignore their faxes, and it will be near impossible to get a refill. Very unprofessional. It is not even worth the trouble. The only decent person working there is Blanca.

Then the doctor said that her assistant was going to come in and give my daughter a breathing treatment and I waited for 30 mins., finally I came out to ask someone what was taking so long and she went to tell the doctor and the doctor had forgot to tell someone to give my daughter her treatment. I was there for over 5 hours. Then on another occasion my daughter had been sick and I took her in for the doctor to check her, and she questioned my parenting skills and asked what kind of mother was I for not bringing my daughter in sooner.

Not telling them they are fat, literally using the word fat! Our society is messed up enough for children to be wanting to be thin like the magazines. But to tell a teenage girl who does sports, excerises, & is vegan that she is fat is unacceptable on many levels including professionalism! I understand that for health reasons one may need to lose weight, there are certainly nicer and more professional ways to express this to a patient. Please save your children the trauma & find a doctor who will actually care for them."
