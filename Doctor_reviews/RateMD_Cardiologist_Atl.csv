His gentle friendliness and nature immediately put me in a relaxed state of mind in the midst of a condition that was frightening. He listens to me and takes the time to explain diagnoses and procedures. Dr. Guest is interested in me as a person, taking the time to talk about what's going on in my life but not wasting time. I always ask a lot of questions, and Dr. Guest is patient in answering them; I never feel like he's trying to get me out of the office either. For a good, knowledgeable, personable cardiologist, you can't do better than Dr. Guest!"
4,Dr. Thomas Guest,Atlanta,Georgia, Cardiologists , Male,15,4.63,2014-01-03T15:37:23Z,5,5,5,5,5,"The patient's well-being is of utmost importance to Dr Guest. He is very professional and has excellent inter-personal skills in making you feel confident and comfortable. He does not rush the appointment and takes time in knowing who you are.

I had several tests-one in his office! He is the nicest man! He notices little things-like the book I wads reading each time! At my second visit, he asked what I was reading and said I'd been reading an interesting book previously! He's for healthy eating and vitamins which not all doctors are. At my first appointment. I had to wait 49 miinutes before being. His staff is equally nice. I'd highly recommend him!"
6,Dr. Thomas Guest,Atlanta,Georgia, Cardiologists , Male,15,4.63,2013-11-14T17:10:08Z,5,5,5,5,5,Dr. Guest is fabulous. Came into the ER late at night to see my husband who was having a heart attack I truly believe that Dr. Guest my husbands life that night.

8,Dr. Thomas Guest,Atlanta,Georgia, Cardiologists , Male,15,4.63,2013-10-19T07:32:00Z,5,5,5,5,5,"I was referred to Dr. Guest by a neighbor after having had heart issues & procedures done elsewhere and still not feeling right. Don't take his initial serious demeanor or straight forwardness wrongly - as he truly cares about his patients and his profession. He is extremely knowledgeable, thoughtful, caring, listens to your concerns and more than most doctors - takes his time with you. Dr. Guest also believes in looking at the bigger picture and your health overall. I can honestly say that after my first visit with him, there was a sense that he knew exactly what was wrong & what had been missed previously, but was professional enough not to make any conclusions till he was able to further examine me himself - and he was right. He is part of a great team, his nurse, PA and staff in the clinic also exhibit the same traits, are responsive when you call in - and make you feel at home remembering you by name. Highly recommend him and would not go elsewhere - he truly cares about you."
9,Dr. Thomas Guest,Atlanta,Georgia, Cardiologists , Male,15,4.63,2013-10-15T11:48:36Z,5,5,5,5,5,Dr. Guest is fantastic! Always caring and very knowledgeable. PERSONALLY calls with test results! Had a very positive experience during heart catheterization - 2 stents placed. Now during office visits spends time focusing on nutrition and exercise - lost 42 lbs and feel great. Could not recommend ANY doctor more highly. I've also referred my husband and he's doing great too!

Dr. Champney will err on the side of PROTECTING you versus being overly concerned about insurance coverage and payment therefrom. I never started out to be her patient but am eternally grateful that her partner was out of the office the day of my appointment and she covered for him. She's been my cardiologist since, and will continue to be."

34,Dr. Spencer Palmer,Atlanta,Georgia, Cardiologists , Male,12,4.29,2018-08-18T06:22:45.723Z,5,5,5,5,5,Had 100% blocked LDA for 7 hours before getting to CL/Emory in Dec. 2005. As bad as they get. Dr. Palmer stayed OT past his shift for me. Was supposed to just cath me for bypass but ER gave me too much blood thinner. He unblocked the artery with the catheter + saved my life. 
35,Dr. Spencer Palmer,Atlanta,Georgia, Cardiologists , Male,12,4.29,2018-03-02T06:58:40.539Z,5,5,5,5,5,First visit was good. I go back soon for a stress test.

37,Dr. Spencer Palmer,Atlanta,Georgia, Cardiologists , Male,12,4.29,2012-09-28T15:33:36Z,1,1,1,1,1,"The reason for my rating..... I called in two prescriptions on Sunday to my pharmacy (authorization needed). The following Friday,(five days later) I was advised by my pharmacy to call the physician's office that they had made several attempts with no response. My physician's nurse stated I could not get a refill without an appt. I made the appt and still no prescription. The nurse was rude and was more interested in controlling the conversation, stating the rules instead of resolving my issue. I have not had two prescriptions for five days. My blood pressure will shoot up quickly to around 220 over 130 without my meds. At this time, I have an appt in two months as advised by my ""caring"" nurse and no meds called in...This is the reason for my rating."
38,Dr. Spencer Palmer,Atlanta,Georgia, Cardiologists , Male,12,4.29,2012-05-23T14:54:20Z,3.5,4,4,3,3,"I saw Dr P. several times. I did not think he cared about me, as a new patient,he did not or could not answer my questions. I hoped he would talk more on the next 2 visits, he did not. Maybe he did not like me. I am a 61 yr old woman in need of a well rated & caring Cardiologist who can do more than smile."
39,Dr. Spencer Palmer,Atlanta,Georgia, Cardiologists , Male,12,4.29,2011-11-01T11:36:08Z,5,5,5,5,5,"I have been a patient of Dr. Spencer Palmer for over 5 years and have found he is the most professional, competent, dedicated and caring physician I have ever worked with. He always knows the details of my case, which he manages extremely well. During the years of his care, I have learned to trust his expertise, judgment and medical skills without question. His bedside manner could be taught as a medical class. I am proud to be one of his patients."
40,Dr. Spencer Palmer,Atlanta,Georgia, Cardiologists , Male,12,4.29,2011-10-17T14:23:31Z,5,5,5,5,5,Excellent cardiologist.... knowledgable and caring staff. We highly recommend this cardiologist.

45,Dr. James R. Kauten,Atlanta,Georgia, Cardiologists , Male,9,4.62,2016-06-21T18:41:28.009Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Had a quintuple bypass performed by Dr. Kauten on 5/6/16 and I am up and around 6 weeks later. Simply the best. Shout out to his PA Phil, the ICU team, the nurses and everyone else involved with my care. You were all the best. Thank you."
46,Dr. James R. Kauten,Atlanta,Georgia, Cardiologists , Male,9,4.62,2015-05-25T08:59:59.853Z,2,2,2,1,3,"After monitoring a heart murmur for a number of years I elected to have Dr. James R. Kauten, MD perform a heart valve replacement. I entered the hospital as an otherwise healthy 58 year old male. In the recovery room after surgery I began to bleed. Dr. Kauten had to reopened my chest to stop the bleeding. After receiving many units of blood, I was sent back to recovery. During the operation my AV node was seriously damaged. For the rest of my life I am totally dependent on a pace maker for survival. I would not recommend Dr. James R. Kauten, MD to a friend."
47,Dr. James R. Kauten,Atlanta,Georgia, Cardiologists , Male,9,4.62,2013-10-16T23:25:38Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Kauten is incredible. I required open heart surgery and my emergency room doctor sent me to Dr. Kauten. God was looking out for me. He is a kind, reassuring GENIUS! Might lack just a little in bedside manner, seems kind of shy actually, but he is a great doctor. My surgery was two years ago and I had six bypasses and an ICD implanted later by another doctor. If you have a broken heart, this is the man you want taking care of you. And his staff is also excellent. My wife and I were in love with them, and all Piedmont personnel, during my two weeks there. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
48,Dr. James R. Kauten,Atlanta,Georgia, Cardiologists , Male,9,4.62,2012-01-11T16:19:33Z,5,5,5,5,5,"This dr did my aortic heart valve replacement on 8-15 -11 .He did a great job,I am very blessed to have found him and am doing great I would recommend him in a""heart beat""!!"

50,Dr. James R. Kauten,Atlanta,Georgia, Cardiologists , Male,9,4.62,2008-03-04T08:22:22Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Kauten seemed very caring and knowledgeable but his partner, Dr. Louis Prevosti, was the doctor that did the bypass on my father. Not just sour grapes that he passed away after Dr. Prevosti did his work but the fact that he told us AFTERWARDS that the surgery would have been difficult for a man half my dad's age. How interesting he couldn't have told us this before the surgery. The story changes after the surgery. No, they can't know everything ahead of time, but don't give tell the family he has a 95% chance if he has more like a 5% chance. Have the decency to be honest. You should be ashamed, Dr. Prevosti. Be glad the rest of the doctors on your team are not like you."

The first I felt was not communicating with my gastrointestinal team that was involved in my case. The second was really great but was too difficult to reach. Dr. Knapp and his team at Piedmont is the perfect blend of the rating categories. He cares about his patients and is a very straight talker/explainer. If you can't understand what he tells you then you might be the problem.
55,Dr. William S. Knapp,Atlanta,Georgia, Cardiologists , Male,4,5,2011-08-12T04:43:26Z,5,5,5,5,5,Wonderful doctor. Very sensitive to patient's concerns and ailment. Top notch!

Dr. Gonzalez is professional, kind, reassuring, calm and compassionate. I am rather 'nervous' at any doctor, and she truly has the ability to put me at ease.

58,Dr. Laura E. Gonzalez,Atlanta,Georgia, Cardiologists , Female,3,5,2015-02-17T20:51:02.980Z,5,5,5,5,5,She is very thorough and has a bedside manner that is beyond kind and compassionate. She is the kind of doctor you want when you're scared because you have to go to a cardiologist.
59,Dr. Laura E. Gonzalez,Atlanta,Georgia, Cardiologists , Female,3,5,2013-01-03T21:54:02Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr Gonzalez did some tests on me, and personally called me back with the results, and talked with with me for about 6 minutes taking time and answering all my questions. She is courteous, thorough and professional. She told me to check back in a year. She doesnt do unecessary tests. She was reassuring, and not ""all about the money"". I recommend her highly"

Azar,Atlanta,Georgia, Cardiologists , Male,3,4.92,2012-04-01T17:51:18Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Back in April, 2000, I went to the emergency room at St Joseph’s one morning about 7AM after having suffered through several episodes of chest pain during the night. They started a nitroglycerine drip and asked if I had a cardiologist, I said no, and they called Dr. Gordon Azar who came right away He immediately saw that I had a septal infarct and he sent me straight to the cath lab-wasting no time. He did a cardiac catherization, which was totally painless, and he placed a stent in my coronary artery. It is still there and working twelve years later, keeping that artery open, and blood flowing to my heart muscle. Dr Azar “saved my heart”. (so the nurses all said) and I could tell he was an exceptional Doctor. Some years later my cousin had the same problem, and I told him to immediately call Dr. Azar, he did, and Dr. Azar also saved his life. If you have chest pains or heart issues, definitely call Dr. Azar; He will take great care of you! God bless Dr. Azar."
62,Dr. Gordon J. Azar,Atlanta,Georgia, Cardiologists , Male,3,4.92,2008-10-09T12:35:48Z,5,5,5,5,5,"I have been seeing Dr. Azar for over 30 years and he always spends the time that is needed, no matter how long it takes. He is sincerely concerned with his patients' well being."

Because of his specialty, I sometimes have to wait but that is o.k. because someone needs him more at the time. I highly recommend Dr. Wilmer to anyone needing a cardiologist."
65,Dr. Charles I. Wilmer,Atlanta,Georgia, Cardiologists , Male,4,4.17,2007-09-08T22:51:21Z,4.5,4,4,5,5,"Dr. Wilmer has always been warm, patient and compassionate. He would rather err on the side of safety and that's why he schedules tests instead of guessing the problem. Dr. Wilmer knew my insurance would change this year so he squeezed in my treadmill test before the end of the year, during the Holiday period, just to help me. He always takes the time to explain the situation and procedure, no matter how busy he is and never makes me feel rushed. He is extremely knowledgeable and he cares for his patients. If he's ever late for an appt, it's due to a hospitalized or critically ill patient."
66,Dr. Charles I. Wilmer,Atlanta,Georgia, Cardiologists , Male,4,4.17,2007-04-10T09:02:28Z,2,,2,1,3,"Made me feel like I was a research subject rather than a person. Although he did seem fairly knowledgeable, his bedside manner was severely wanting as he seemed aloof, condescending and negative. His mid-level staff matched him in coldness. The only positive experience was my interaction with the front desk staff who were warm and personable."

74,Dr. Lee B. Padove,Atlanta,Georgia, Cardiologists , Male,2,5,2008-09-03T06:25:38Z,5,5,5,5,5,He is a great Cardiologist. He tried to save my son but he could'nt. I think he was more hurt that my son died then I was. My son thanked him for trying to help him. Dr. Padove stated that I went in to tell Jamaal the bad news and he ended up consoling me. That is the way my child was. He did not want you to feel sorry for him. Dr. Padove is a very good Doctor because he took care of my only child. I am very greatful for him.

He is not a pill-pusher and will encourage you to change your life-style to reverse unhealthy habits. He spends quality time with you asking you questions about any recent changes that makes your life more difficult or that indicates problems. He's compassionate and considerate taking time to answer all your questions with explanations in common English (not medical terms that discourage further discussion).
As I was leaving, an elderly couple were so excited to see him that they hugged him like a son. I fully understand why. I have never had a doctor who treated me like a member of his family and I feel like he's a member of my family. Devoted to him and friends who also have him as their cardiologist feel the same way."

He took incredible care of my son and I feel we owe his life to him. The only reason I rated him 4 on punctuality was because we sometimes would have to wait 15 to 30 minutes to see him. He stayed with us as long as we needed to talk with him (we never felt rushed) and I'm sure he gave all of his patients this same kind of care therefore, of course, he would be late."

Wilson,Atlanta,Georgia, Cardiologists , Male,3,4.08,2008-02-15T21:28:15Z,5,5,5,5,5,WHEN I HAD MY HEART ATTACK HE WAS ALWAYS CHECKING ON ME WHEN I WENT HOME AND IF I DID NOT ANSWER THE PHONE AFTER HE CALLED 2 OR 3 TIMES IN 10 MINUTES HE WOULD SEND THE PARAMEDICS WHICH IN SEVERAL CASES THEY ARRIVED IN TIME TO SAVE MY LIFE. THE DOCTOR'S CARING SAVED MY LIFE 3 TIMES. TO THIS DAY HE STILL IS SEEING ME WHEN I HAVE BEEN IN THE HOSPITAL FOR OTHER OPERATIONS. I FIND HIS CONCERN ADMIRBLE AND COMFORTING. HE IS THE BEST HEART SPECIALIST THAT I HAVE BEEN TO OVER THE YEARS.
102,Dr. Joseph S. Wilson,Atlanta,Georgia, Cardiologists , Male,3,4.08,2007-07-17T10:23:52Z,2.8,1,5,1,4,"I should preface my rating by stating the fact that I am disabled. I sought the medical services of Dr. Wilson twice. During the interim period between the first and second medical appointments, I was prescribed a medication that was eventually declared unsafe by the FDA, due to possible adverse heart abnormalities and side effects. This medication was NOT prescribed by Dr. Wilson. The first medical appointment, with Dr. Wilson, was routine and ordinary. However, the second medical appointment was not routine and ordinary. During the second office viist, a battery of tests were performed to determine if there were heart abnormalities. After the tests, Dr. Wilson talked with me one-on-one. His general demeanor and tone could be described as, ""I'm busy and I don't have time to talk to you."" After I asked him one or two short follow-up questions, he walked right out of the office. Apparently my disability made him very uncomfortable. However, he wasn't uncomfortable taking my money."

It is expected, and it's part of their job, to manage this. Gandy's staff has been very delinquent in spotting this issue, and calling me back to fix it... consequently, I have a lab company trying to collect hundreds of dollars from me because of this, and the Dr's staff never returns my calls and ignores me. ... so go ahead, waist your time and money, with a Dr. office that is NOT on top of their game "

Appointments include in the neighborhood of 20 to 30 minutes with a patient, enough time to clarify and discuss issues and options without feeling rushed. Notice I said DISCUSS, this means your feelings and opinions matter and are taken into account. Her dedication does impact punctuality, but one cannot fault her for this because it is more often than not a result of attending to her more critical hospital patients, and the office staff ALWAYS notifies you in time if she is running late.

This wonderful physician put together a great team of doctors who worked so well communicating with each other that mom survived 3 cardiac arrests. Dr. Ang knew exactly when to back off and allow the lung doctors to do their job first, then had an infectious disease physician step in to clear her of any infection before he had mom's internal pace maker put in.

139,Dr. Steven R. Sigman,Atlanta,Georgia, Cardiologists , Male,1,5,2019-05-09T11:01:59.182Z,5,5,5,5,5,"I have been a patient of Dr Sigman for years, since his days as a professor at Emory University. As you can see I have nothing but good things to say about him. When I first saw him he found an issue that had been causing me problems for years but had been missed by several other cardiologists simply because he thought outside of the usual box. He is knowledgeable and considerate. He has a superb ""bedside manner"", will discuss matters openly and clearly, and then makes sure that you, the patient, are fully involved in your treatment.
On top of that, he is simply a nice person"
140,Dr. Thomas S. Backer,Roswell,Georgia, Cardiologists , Male,4,3.13,2012-04-24T17:32:35Z,4.8,5,4,5,5,I have been a patient of Dr. Backer for over 3 years and find him to be an excellent doctor. Both Dr. Backer and his staff are friendly and efficient. Dr. Backer has a great bedside manner and spends as much time as needed to make you comfortable and to answer your questions. He is very professional and knowledgeable. Once I read an article which created some concerns for me about a medication I am taking. I left a message with a staff member as to my concerns and several days went by and I had not received a response. I thought possibly the staff member didn’t give him my message. When Dr. Backer did call me back I could see why it took him some time to respond to me. He had done a through research of the subject matter and was able to completely satisfy my concerns. I feel completely satisfied intrusting my cardiovascular medical care with Dr. Backer.
141,Dr. Thomas S. Backer,Roswell,Georgia, Cardiologists , Male,4,3.13,2011-12-01T12:06:35Z,1,1,1,1,1,"this physician is really not good at al.l. his staff seem to have been trained to be rude and not helpful, particularly his spouse who works in his office or has worked there. i would not advise anyone to go to this physician"

149,Dr. Victor E. Corrigan,Atlanta,Georgia, Cardiologists , Male,1,4.5,2011-08-24T16:26:07Z,4.5,4,4,5,5,"Dr. Corrigan is a wonderful doctor. He makes sure to fully discuss any issues and options and explains why or why not some things can or cannot be done or work in different ways. He has a good, confident bedside manner and definitely takes his patients' health seriously and personally. He's willing to work with the patient to provide the best care while also laying things on the line when it's merited. Wait time depends on location (he works at two) and time of appointment, but he definitely spends time with you to make sure you have full buy-in to his findings and suggestions."

151,Dr. Rory A. Priester,Atlanta,Georgia, Cardiologists , Male,3,2.83,2014-06-17T23:49:59Z,2.3,5,2,1,1,"Dr Priester doesn't respond to messages or email. He gave me a referral to a specialist three months ago, but he messed it up so that Kaiser has the wrong referral in their system. I've repeatedly called over the past three months, even going so far as to find all of the contact information for the specialists and their procedures, so that I could list *exactly* what I need him to do in both an email and a telephone message. I haven't heard from him yet."

Smart, stays abreast in her field however there seems to be a repeated practice of firm in over booking patients. Your on time arrival standard waiting room time is oft times in excess of 1.5 hours, in addition to when you're called back to the examination room you wait another hour or even longer."

Afterwards he told us he would only be able to get up to 70% of the blockage. He recommended a doctor from Seattle Washington do this procedure on me. He said he was going to be down on the 10th to help them on their 10 worst patients. He said he could get it around 90% opening. He said the doctor from Seattle would go in one groin and they would go in the other groin and/or my arm. I said OK. On the 10th after 4 hours in me. Demetris came to my room and told us they could not get to the blockage. They recommended I go to Washington and let Lombardi do it at his hospital. When I asked what the difference would be by going up there. He said Dr Lombardi just advised during my procedure, it was against the law for him to do it here. He said we miss under stood. It cost me a lot of money and time from work. I would have never agreed to this if I had known that Lombardi was not going to do this."
161,Dr. Kenneth G. Taylor,Atlanta,Georgia, Cardiologists , Male,1,2.75,2011-01-21T04:03:10Z,2.8,3,5,1,2,"Dr. Taylor seems to have missed type 2 diabetes. My recollection is that I gave a verbal medical history to him and his PA and that tshe failed to appreciate the signifigance of my reports of sweating, jumpiness, nerve pain, etc. They also seem to have failed to appreciate the fact that my business requires intense physical activity; yet, at the time, I was unable to lose weight. Truthfully, Dr. Taylor seems to be a good cardiologist and his female PA seems to be good at seeking out evidence of heart disease, but they both seem to me to have ""tunnel vision"". I distinctly recall complaining of ""hypoglycemia"" and sore knees. Since I have been treated correctly for type 2 diabetes, I have lost 55 pounds, my knees don't ache or seem stiff, and I don't feel jumpy or irritable. My health is a big deal to me. I'm not writing that Taylor or his PA are incompetent; I'm stating that they might have listened to me better in the one instance I used their service."

Medical staff were fine, even tho lengthy intake procedure with two medical staff before even seeing the dr and retelling presenting concerns for a third time. The office staff was incompetent."
163,Dr. Mahesh M. Patel,Atlanta,Georgia, Cardiologists , Male,2,3.38,2007-06-20T13:53:40Z,5,,5,5,5,Listens attentively to the patient. Explains precedures and problems. Originally recommended to me by a nurse when I was unhappy with another doctor during an admission. Have never regretted changing. He also has an excellent nursing staff.

I contacted Dr. William Brown regarding chest pains (Angina) on a Friday afternoon in August 2006. He was insistent that I immediately check into Wellstar Kennestone Hospital I explained the pains were intermittent and had been present for weeks. In addition there was an animal at home & I needed to arrange for his care. I checked into the hospital the following Monday, having no idea that he was personally offended by the delay. During a weeks stay in the hospital, 8 stents were installed. (Yes eight). Dr. Brown allowed no consultation with the anesthesiologist. It was a lengthy procedure, under total anesthesia, that left me unbalanced and unable to walk unassisted to this day. When I later questioned the results in a letter to Brown, it was ignored and he proceeded to ban me from his practice. William Brown should never have been granted a medical license of any kind."
165,Dr. Wickliff,Atlanta,Georgia, Cardiologists , Male,2,2.13,2007-11-03T16:19:18Z,2.3,3,3,1,2,"I completely agree with the prior reviewer. Dr. W misdiagnosed my problem. He dismissed my complaints as being in my head even though logically that could not be true. Like the last reviewer experience is that he is an egotist and treated me as if I were stupid and crazy. I left him and went to another Cardiologist at St. Joseph's who performed the barium stress test pushing me to the level where my symptoms appeared and were recorded. He then explained that what I was experiencing was very real and definitely ""not in my head""."
166,Dr. Wickliff,Atlanta,Georgia, Cardiologists , Male,2,2.13,2007-01-24T00:10:37Z,1.7,,2,1,2,Too big for his britches. If you see him briefly in the ER you can readily identify the he is a major homophobe. What he doesn't tell you is that he will no longer see you but his PA will coordinate your care. The PA represents himself as an MD ( he no longer works for Piedmont) I wonder why. When I looked online to check the PA's licensure he was no longer licensed as a PA. I followed up with another healthcae provider and had it confirmed that Dr. Whicliff (?sp)completely miss diagnosed my condition. The man is an ass.
167,Dr. Andrew C. Wickliffe,Atlanta,Georgia, Cardiologists , Male,1,2.25,2014-06-01T12:55:22Z,2.3,1,2,3,3,"Proceed with caution here. I was seen and evaluated by Dr. Wickliffe and his staff for lone atrial fibrillation. I was extremely unimpressed with his staff and his lack of accessibility for questions. Doctor-patient communication was extremely poor in my case. The only way to communicate with him seemed to be either in person (office visit and fee required) or through his clinical assistant, who at the time was not even an R.N. Even her responses were painfully slow - whether via e-mail (with, btw, no evidence of Wickliffe's review or approval) or phone. When he recommended an ablation, needless to say I sought a second opinion. This second specialist advised me that the risks of this procedure in my case clearly outweighed the benefits. I subsequently chose to end my relationship with Piedmont Heart Institute."
