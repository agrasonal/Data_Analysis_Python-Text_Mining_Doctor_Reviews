Previously, I had been going to the same doctor over the course of 8 months, with all but the right diagnosis. Del Rosario then referred me to a specialist and I got treated accordingly...That easy. He was friendly, helpful, patient and considerate."

Del Rosario,Los Angeles,California, Internists / Geriatricians , Male,14,4.42,2011-06-28T04:50:24Z,2.8,4,3,2,2,"I used to really like Dr. Del but over the years he seems to have gotten less interested in taking the time to figure out a correct diagnosis. I had three things misdiagnosed by him. In one case he kept prescribing me the wrong antibiotics over and over again. When I finally didn't want to try one that hadn't worked a second time he got annoyed and insisted I use it. In two different cases, I finally went to specialists who told me I had completely different problems, then treated them correctly and they went away. After this, I lost confidence in Dr. Del even though I'd been going to him for many years."

Dr. D. is extremely knowledgeable and thorough, and corrected wrongs done by my previous doctor without any hint of judgement toward that other physician."

His knowledge is pretty standard and by the book. I'd say in the middle because their were times I found out more information on what I had on my own. But you know your own body than anyone else. If you get him on a good day he's extremely helpful and talks it over with you, but if you get him on a bad day, he doesn't seem to want to be bothered and you feel rushed. I know we all have our bad days and have to turn it on, but when you're discussing a serious issue, that can be dangerous and lead to a false diagnosis. All in all his doors are open to all people which is a plus."
42,Dr. Alex R. Del Rosario,Los Angeles,California, Internists / Geriatricians , Male,14,4.42,2009-11-11T10:13:03Z,4.5,4,4,5,5,"Dr. D. is the best doctor for HIV care. He is extremely proactive, and very knowledgeable on current best treatment practices."
43,Dr. Alex R. Del Rosario,Los Angeles,California, Internists / Geriatricians , Male,14,4.42,2009-03-04T23:46:24Z,4.5,5,4,4,5,"Very knowledgeable doctor and is very good at listening to all that is going on with your health. I find him to be proactive in my health management and asking the questions that help future problems later if I were rushed out of the office. Concerning the previous comments about the steroids (aka testosterone replacement therapy), they can be very helpful to those dealing with HIV disease and are very valid as a treatment option. Steroids are what high school kids who have testosterone levels through the roof trying to improve their game; testosterone replacement therapy is what HIV+ adults use to prevent wasting and counter some of the deforming side affects of HIV medications. He is a disease management specialist who does not judge one's lifestyle. I find that because he is an HIV+ doctor he can truly understand the plight of his HIV+ patients. He can come off as being gruff at first but he really knows what he is doing and he's smart as hell."
44,Dr. Young-Jik Lee,Los Angeles,California, Internists / Geriatricians , Male,7,4.89,2014-03-13T11:10:44Z,4.8,5,4,5,5,"Upon meeting Dr. Lee seemed very knowledgeable and he is an internist which means he is trained to solve any health problem.

He was very professional and took the time to go over what was wrong with me so he can do a proper diagnosis. Once he realized what it could possibly be, he made sure to explain my condition in great detail so I would be able to understand. He also recommended specific medicine and lifestyle changes. Now I'm all better and it's because of Dr. Young."

His knowledge in the field of medicine is very minimal. He really should not be a doctor. It's not for him. Don't bother calling his office either, might as well find a doctor that went to a more credible medical school. He's just looking after your money and insurrance, not your health!!! The people who gave him good ratings are most probably his family and friends. NOT SURPRISED AT ALL! Just to let you know I am not the type of person who writes reviews at all, but my experience with this doctor was so bad that I couldn't bare to think of someone else going to him.

She likes to run a bunch of tests though...so be ready for her to say she wants to get blood drawn to confirm you don't have cancer (in whatever body part hurts you)...it's happen to me twice in the last 7 years I've seen her.

I had blood work done for illness and instead of calling with the results they mailed them and it had been a week and I had still not received them so I went to pick up a copy. The results were alarming and it stated I needed more blood work done. They did not have the courtesy to call with these alarming results or have me come in sooner for more tests. When I asked to just review the alarming test results with Dr. Alice Agzarian, I was told i needed to make an appointment and the earliest was not until the following week. When going to get my extra blood tests done I asked what extra tests I was doing and no one knew or could tell me. The way this was handled was horrible, and all this anxiety would have been eased with a phone call of the results and answers. Although Dr. Agzarian is kind I would take my health else where because of the service."

He is also very nice and makes you comfortable. The only thing is that at some of my consultations, sometimes he would bring his students in. I was feeling a bit uncomfortable by this since I am not able to open up and also because he shares his attention to the patient and to the student.

Always ready to write patient a prescription as the solution to all problems, without concern for side affects or contradictions between medicines. Cohan is too busy writing articles and promoting himself via radio show to really be concerned about the welfare of his patients. Does not take the time to truly understand the underlying issues, though on the surface acts as if he does."

Looks about 10 years younger than he is. Gave a very thorough exam. Friendly and courteous staff. Beautiful office (new) with x-ray, lab, stress testing and colonoscopy. Bottom line: best doc I've ever seen. Can recommend him without reservations."

I was having chest pain. I am young and dont smoke, or drink and am very healthy. Or so I thought. He took my complaints seriously. He did the first head to toe physical exam I have ever had. Most doctors spend 5 minutes with you. He did a complete exam, asked me alot of questions. Arranged a diagnostic test and then told he have a blocage in my artery. He arranged for a procedure and balooned my artery open. I owe my life to him. I have since referred a lot of new patients to him and am grateful to his help. He is easy to speak to, is very down to earth and sees his patients on time unlike most others. He came to the hospital daily to visit me sometime after midnight and overall I felt in good hands."

He was actually kind of morose. Maybe he was having an off day. He knew all the questions to ask about what was bothering me. I felt that he was able to assure me that I was okay. However, I'm didn't feel completely comfortable with him as a person since he was so morose. Also, I was told the day before that my appointment was canceled (via voicemail), and when I called in the next day to ask why, I was told that the doctor could actually ""accommodate"" me. I would have missed my appointment if I hadn't asked to confirm that my appointment was canceled. He did send me an email before my appointment saying he was looking forward to meeting me."

Dr. Borookhim is ""brand new"" to me as a resident visitor. He seemed ok, but a bit distant. Of course I'm new to him as well. Here's hopeing its a take."

Borookhim,Beverly Hills,California, Internists / Geriatricians , Male,12,4.02,2009-06-11T00:05:44Z,5,5,5,5,5,"My intitial visit visit Dr. Borookhim was about two years ago while in LA. It was proof enough for me that he will be my doctor. It was the first time in years that I had a complete physical. The last time I had the a full go over by a doctor, not in a hurry, was when I was a child. He did not waste my time going through all the preliminaries as he had emailed me the questionnaires before I got there. His staff was knowledgeable and appropriate. He listened to me which was a first. Most doctors cut me off after the first minute. The labs were drawn on site and he personally contacted me to review my results via email. He picks up his phone after hours when you call him and has your number stored and calls you by your name which is disarming at first. You feel you are with an equal and not someone who is looking down upon you. He even made a house call for me which saved me 10 hours waiting in an emergency room. It was well worth the charge in my opinion."

I have found the doctor to be easy to engage with. He has been quite easy for me to get a hold of for my own persona medical needs. He responds to his emails quickly and relatively fast to phone calls. I have sent him other members of my family as well and he has done a superb job with them as well. He ended up admitting my aunt on an initial visit to his office and we were very happy with his diagnostic skills. I am happy that Dr. Borookhim has accepted me into his practice.

Dr. Borookhim took care of my sister throughout her 12 day hospitalization at hospital. He saw her everyday despite the fact many others on the case had left because it was a weekend or holiday. He was easy to get a hold off and explained what was being planned. My sister had a very complicated course but I believe did well thanks to his care and expertise. When we tried to make an appointment with his office, his office manager Rebecca was quite nice and helpfull. She even emailed us all the forms we needed before we go to see him which saved us a lot of time. Most importantly, you can get a hold of him directly on his cell phone after hours which is great. There was not need to page him or speak to an operator. That is an amazing thing in this day and age when most others take half a day to call you back if they get the page at all."

He was assigned to me at the ER when I was hospitalized. I can literally write a book on all the instances where he demonstrated unacceptable behavior, a terrible attitude, and a complete lack of professionalism. I have no information as to his competence as a physician, because it was the amazing team of specialists that really treated me. If it wasn’t for them, I would have completely lost my mind. My family even tried to get another doctor to replace him, but we learned that once hospitalized, it is very difficult for a new “attending” or “primary” physician to jump in and take over, unless there is a previous medical history with the doctor. So basically, I was stuck with this jerk until I was released. He is arrogant, has the WORST bedside manner, doesn't answer calls or questions, and simply does not care! He was rude to me, my family, and even to the hospital staff. If you are referred to him, run the other way, FAST."
143,Dr. Michael D. Borookhim,Beverly Hills,California, Internists / Geriatricians , Male,12,4.02,2007-11-16T14:07:13Z,5,5,5,5,5,"I first met Dr. B at Cedars. He was referred to me by the attending MD in the ER. Boy was I lucky to have met him! He is so thorough and kind and possesses an excellent bedside manner. While an inpatient in the hospital, he check in every day to see how I was progressing, his concern felt genuine and I appreciated the visits. During my subsequent appointments with the Dr., he explained procedures to me very thoroughly, and is always willing to answer my questions in a very patient manner, never condescending. Due to some medical concerns, he has had to refer me to a few medical specialist, who have been equally as proficient, and when I mention I am a patient of Dr. B. it appears to me that I am treated with the utmost care. I have been very impressed overall. However, the most impressive thing about Dr. B. is his availability. He has been available to me when I need him, day or night and I truly appreciate that extra touch. I would recommend him very highly."

Borookhim,Beverly Hills,California, Internists / Geriatricians , Male,12,4.02,2007-10-04T18:17:03Z,5,5,5,5,5,"I was referred to Dr. Borookhim after a vist to the emergency room after a fall. He was probably the 5th or 6th doctor I saw in the aftermath of that fall and he's the one I have stuck with. His friendly disposition, thorough explanation of his diagnosis and his knowledge of medicine is what keeps me going back to him. I would recommend Dr. Borookhim to my closest of friends. If you are looking for a recommendation - look no further; you've found the right doctor."

Has never shied away from ordering tests, taking the time to consult, prescribing meds, or making a referral. Very knowledgeable. Always follows up when need be - either via the phone or a letter. Though he may not always look you in the eye, he's as friendly as necessary. I was pleasantly surprised to find him in this small network."

Be warned that he's very loud but friendly, caring, competent, knowledgeable, and persistent. My only problem is that, as per so many HMO primary care physicians, he's sometimes rushed (overbooked?), so get your most important questions in right away. He refers to Kaiser specialists, however, in any appropriate situation. I've recommended him. "

My health insurance company assigned me to Dr. Madden who works at an Urgent care facility. I have had 3 scheduled appts in past year and each one was 40- 60 minute delay presumbably because it is an Urgent care facility. Last year I had some abnormal results on labwork received via mail. I called office and they refused to allow me to discuss with Dr. Madden directly. A receptionist called me back and informed me that Dr.Madden said there was nothing to worry about but that he could not call me back directly. If I needed to discuss further I would have to set up another appt. Last week I tried to book my annual exam and was told the first available appt is in two months. I finally decided to switch to another primary care doctor. He is nice guy but major trade off in service when affiliated with Urgent Care facility.

He makes you feel comfortable discussing any issues you may have- as serious or embarrassing as they may be. This is a trait i find most important in any doctor. He has a great bedside manner, is efficient and has a down to earth quality that makes going to his office a pleasure."

First of all, his bed sidemanners are amazing...he makes you feel comfortable, makes excellent conversation and is pretty funny; this is something that you don't learn in medical school, but is just a part of him. Secondly, his diagnosis has always been spot on. Lastly, he is the only doc that i know that will call patients the next day or so to tell you about lab results, how noble is that? The only negative is that parking is like $3 every 15 minutes (up to like $21 or so), but that's parking... not his business. Highly recommend him. "

Like the others say, I never wait more than a minutes at his Office. He is friendly, but has much knowledge and lots of courtesy,and respects the patients. Amazingly, when I get blood test done, Dr. Uyeki, himself, call me to let me know the result on the same day!! When I am really sick, Dr. calls me to follow up how I am doing. His Office is very kind and efficient. I do recommend Dr. Uyeki to my important friends."

Don't let this small sample of good reviews fool you--Dr. Uyeki is not worth your time or money. Unfortunately, I had to cancel my first appointment on short notice because my partner is being treated for cancer and I had to unexpectedly be with him at the hospital on the day of my appointment. The receptionist was very accommodating at the time and told me that the cancellation would not be a problem. Flash forward a couple of weeks: when I called to reschedule the appointment today, I was told by the receptionist that Dr. Uyeki had left a note specifying that I am no longer allowed to make an appointment. She explained that I've been unceremoniously dismissed by his office because I cancelled. If Dr. Uyeki is this unprofessional, curt and passive aggressive before meeting with a patient, I don't care to find out how he behaves once he's actually treating one."

He IS honest so if you don't like that maybe he is not for you. He is thorough, knowledgable, prompt, and compassionate. He always takes the time to give you a personal follow up call after testing. He is always friendly, upbeat and treats you like a human rather than flipping through your file to figure out your name. When I starting going to him, it was so refreshing that he always remembered our previous appointments and conversations. I refer him to everyone."

Dr. Uyeki is very smart and generally thoughtful and knowledgeable in a medical capacity, but he has a very odd tendency to make very rude comments about appearance other touchy qualities."

Dr Uyeki is great, but unfortuantely, needs to work on what he says. He said I was fat and should think about having kids because I was getting old."

While I'm not a doctor so can't really review his actual medical advice, I will say that there are 3 things that I found outstanding about him. The first is that on an emergency over a weekend he personally called me back immediately to help me, and got me set up with some prescriptions (a lot of my previous doctors have told me to suck it up or go to an emergenc clinic instead of talking to me directly). The second is that he draws blood at his office, saving me the massive waste of time running to some testing center. Third, he treats his patients with a lot of respect. He is extremely friendly and has a great bedside manner, but also I've never had to wait more than a couple minutes to see him. He also always sees me personally, and doesn't just delegate entirely to assistants. The final thing which I've noticed is that he was extremely knowledgeable and accurate with regards to all of his diagnoses."

Dr. Spicer is an excellent oncologist with a wonderful bedside manner. He welcomes questions and comments (even from family members), and is very easy to talk to. My mom has been his patient for several years now. She was recently admitted to the hospital and had to have emergency surgery. Although she was technically not his patient for this procedure, he made time to visit my mom several times during her stay to check on how she's doing. I know I will forever appreciate all his efforts, not only in keeping my mom as healthy as can be, but also in showing genuine concern for my mom's general well-being. More importantly, Dr. Spicer is a very knowledgeable oncologist. Nurses at USC Day Hospital, where his patients go, only have good things to say about him and his medical expertise."

I have known her for more than 20 years and I am currently a patient. Dr. Lifshitz is an exceptional physician and is a very caring person. She takes her time with you and she makes sure that you understand what ever she is attempting to explain. She will even write it down for you too! I would highly recommend her to anyone seeking an Internist. She is very busy and this is certainly to be expected considering her expertise.

Is becoming more of a media personality - TV, radio - for the Hispanic community than a practicing doctor. She does not do hospital charting in a timely fashion, and has been sanctioned for it.

He never rushes you as most docs do and he always visits with you to calm you down before taking your blood pressure. I've moved to Northern Cal and no longer see him but if I ever have a problem I would fly down to L.A. for his second opinion. Unfortunate that I can't find doctors up here with such an easy going & fun personality. I would recommend him to anyone!!!!!

He wanted to have an ambulance pick me up from his office and take me directly to the hospital for an admission. He was very concerned about me and wanted me in the hospital immediately. Dr. Pimstone is empathetic, kind, caring, warm, considerate, respectful and good at diagnosing. He has fantastic bedside manner. He is very fast at diagnosing. He is very cheerful. He always wished me a Happy Birthday when he saw me. He was always cheerful and saw the positive of things instead of being down and dreary like a lot of doctors are. He is an optimistic, upbeat kind of person which makes him easy to deal with and a positive experience. Too many doctors are negative, down in the dumps and tell you ""that is impossible"", ""you will never recover"", and similar things. Dr. Pimstone doesn't talk that. He is far to optimistic to be Dr. Downer. He is a very pleasant person."

This left me feeling uncomfortable and I was shocked at how unprofessional she would act while giving ""bad news"" diagnoses compared to how calm and stable my reactions were, when I was the one who was sick. She seems smart at first but really she's just overly-cautious to a huge fault and thinks MD means ""smartest person in the room."""

First I had to wait way past my appointment time about 30 minutes. He was relatively nice, although totally behind the times when it comes to women's health. He wasn't even sure how to prescribe my birth control and was ""shocked"" that my birth control was even covered by my insurance which is not bad but a little strange. Overall my first check up with him was slightly uncomfortable, but not horrendous.
It started getting bad about 8 months later when I called to get a refill on a prescription and they made a comment that they never received the results of my labs they did. Umm...what? I was not notified about anything after my check up so I assumed everything was good. Despite mentioning issues getting my results (or not getting? still unsure of what happened) I heard nothing back.
Here was my tipping point. This does not have to do with the Dr. himself, but with the lady who works the front desk. I called to get a refill on my birth control and she made a comment that I was due for my checkup. I said I knew that was the case but was so swamped with work I was going to make the appointment for August when I had more openings in my scheduled. She told me that they would not refill my prescription until I came into the office for my checkup. I totally understood where she was coming from and said that I was due to take this medication at the end of the week (this was Wed and I needed it by Friday). So I asked if she could refill my prescription for just one more time so I have the next 4 weeks to schedule an appointment.
What followed a long fight where she began by denying me this prescription and then told me how I was placing others at risk by not getting my check up. She continued to make it clear that this was not about the money (which I never brought up) and that they were thinking about my health. She continued to make rude comments about my lifestyle and that I was not caring for my health and that they knew what was best for me. She basically was willing to deny me time sensitive medication that could have placed my health at risk and I was totally shocked.
I will save you all the details, but at the end I was very upset. I am a responsible, well-educated adult who lives a really low risk lifestyle. I not only work in the medical community myself, but also work within the health and fitness industry. I have always been on top of my appointments.
What is sad is even if I was going through a difficult time when it comes to my health (participating in high risk behaviors) the way she spoke to me and placed judgment on my life could have easily make someone just never go back to the doctor again. Talk about letting your patients fall out of care.
After a bit if a fight I did finally demand to get my prescription refilled one last time. I have now switched doctors and am with someone who is woman friendly and will hopefully provide a safer environment for me to receive medical care."

Immediately, Dr. Pessegueiro and his medical team thought outside the box and came up with a diagnosis and treatment within a few days.

He was very cocky & did not listen. He misread my chart (that I was in the hospital 1 month prior when it was 1 year prior). When I corrected him, he continued w/his treatment plan w/out reconsidering (w/the mistake in time). The morning after being discharged, I was in a lot of pain. I paged the Dr. 2x over 2 hours, I had not heard back after several hours. A regular Dr of mine @ UCLA paged/emailed him as well asking him to call me. My call was not returned but emailed my other doctor (w/no helpful information). The next day I was in more pain. I paged him 2x over the course of 2 hours. 4 hours later (& another attempt from my other Dr) my call was returned. Dr. Pessegueiro seemed very irritated, he told me to go to urgent care in the AM--or the ER if my pain was that bad. The way he acts, I can't imagine he actually cares about people. I was afraid & this Dr abandon me. I would avoid this ""doctor""."

He's knowledgable, has a wonderful bedside manner and I have complete faith in him.

In an emergency you can usually get an appointment the same day. Even for regular visits it does not take long to get in. The front desk staff is friendly and helpful as well. Also, I have never had to wait very long in the waiting room, a LOT shorter than any other doctor I have ever seen.

After waiting in a room for an hour, the staff came in to let me know ""she would be in soon"" as in, ""she's still in her car, driving here now"". How unprofessional. The Doctor is only available certain times and certain days, but also require patients come in for a ""check up"" just to renew mandatory maintenance prescriptions. My insurance will only cover 90 day supplies, and Dr. Ho insists I need to come in EVERY 4 months, just to stand on a scale and say ""yes, I still need my medication"". The staff I talked to is so rude, they not only won't call CVS back, but was condescending to me when I explained I work an hour away, and can't just pop in during the few hours a week the doctor is actually there. Her response was ""we all work"". Not even an attempt to help. Now they are holding me hostage, and I will run out of psychological medication in days unless I skip a day of work to fit into HER schedule. Horrible.

She is thorough, kind and eager to engage you, her patient, in every part of your own health regiment.

He's responded to emails nights & weekends when urgent matters arise, and even some not so urgent. We've recently moved out of the LA basin and I really miss his being our primary physician.

He was really conservative about that stuff . He is super sweet and friendly he offered to sell meds from his place but they all do that now its not a requirement just an option. It saves a trip to cvs where u have to wait an hr or more. I don't buy this other guys reveiw on hete that he gets you hooked and he video taped it! I bet he's a typical Internet liar. Or a rival dr. This office is not cutting edge they are 3 rd world ish but he is good for minor problems . He sent me to olive view and when I asked for vicodin he said no .

I had to call several times to get an appointment and left several messages with no one returning my phone calls. Eventually, after my OCD-like persistence of calling her office, I was able to get a human and finally schedule an appointment. Unfortunately this appointment had to be scheduled because when I saw initally saw Dr. Gray, she was unable to address my medical problem b/c she (or her staff) had failed to order the medical supply, thus making my first appointment useless. To add insult to injury, her staff requested a co-payment collection, which I naively paid. Then, the medical staff tried to collect the co-payment on the second visit, even after I was told by the doctor that I could come in for an appointment and not be charged since she was unable to address the medical problem that I came in for initally.

She grasps the door handle when she talks to you, clearly indicating the you are a nuisance and she has more important places to be (although somehow she's never punctual -- go figure). I am now dealing with the consequences of her negligence and misdiagnosis. I was never able to extract meaningful information from her because she was always in a hurry to move on, leaving me with unexplained questions about rather frightening diagnoses.

She treats patients like they are a nuisance and doesn't take the time to understand that patients that are coming to her because they need help, compassion, and treatment.

On my first visit, she prescribed medication for a condition I had and asked me to email her after a month to update her on my situation. I did so, and also asked some questions. Her reply showed that she was not a careful reader-- she didn't address my concerns, and her tone was condescending. Even though I was frustrated at not getting answers, I followed her advice to stick with the meds. A month later I emailed again, and again her response showed that she wasn't paying attention to what I was saying.

When I first saw her about three years ago, she was remarkably enthusiastic, energetic, generous, and warm. I was so happy to have found such a great doctor. My last appointment with her, about three months ago, was completely different--she rushed through the exam and was rather brusque throughout. This change might be attributable to her having had a baby recently, as the last poster noted, or that she also recently received tenure (as a UCLA medical center physician, she is a professor of medicine), which guarantees job security. It's really too bad--she used to be so wonderful."

When I met her, I loved the fact that she was so enthusiastic about being a doctor. She was informative, compassionate and followed through on many of the topics we discussed during our appointments, such as sending me documentation to see a specialist if needed. After marrying and having a child, her demeanor dramatically changed. She became cold and very judgmental, her bedside manner was so intolerable, that I finally changed doctor's this year. She was downright abusive. For example, when I had my annual check up 1.4 years later, she berated me for 15 minutes on how I had gained five pounds and she ""didn't know what was going on."" Every annual check up was $1000.00 billed to my insurance company, of which I pay 20%. I HATE doctor shopping, but at the end of the day, doctor's are still providing a service and I would think repeat business should be emphasized. As a former long-term patient, my advice is to keep shopping."

I have found her to be extremely knowledgeable and caring. I fully believe she saved my life by having the paramedics take me to the hospital emergency room when I experienced a heart arrhythmia problem when arriving at her office. At times I have had to wait a little while in the waiting room or the exam room. All the nurses I have encountered have all been very proficient and professional. Dr. Mattai herself exemplifies professionalism. She always apologizes if she is even a few minutes late.

Anjani Mattai,Los Angeles,California, Internists / Geriatricians , Female,9,3.47,2015-06-17T22:37:31.253Z,1,1,1,1,1,"I had a pre-op appt scheduled with my regular doctor at 1:45pm at the Cantor Women's Health Center at UCLA. I received a call from Jessica at UCLA saying that my doctor was out of town and they rescheduled me at 2pm with another doctor. No problem. I get to the office and it takes a few minutes for them to figure out that I was rescheduled with a doctor in another office in another building- which I was not previously told. I walked over to the other building and arrived at the new office - Dr. Mattai's office- at 2:11pm. I stood in line while the receptionist helped 2 patients before me. One was unhappily rescheduling because she had arrived late. I was helped at 2:16pm. I was immediately told I was ""late"" and past the 2:15pm deadline. I explained that I was on time for my 2pm appt and that I went to the wrong office since no one had told me there was an office change. The receptionist kept saying he had to ""page the doctor"" to see if she would see me. Nevertheless, he took my co-pay and checked me in. I was called back at 2:19pm and the first thing the nurse said is ""You know your appt was at 2pm"" I explained that I was on time but at the wrong office because I was not told of the office switch when UCLA called me to tell me the change of appt time. I explained that I was still in line at the correct office- Dr. Mattai's office- before 2:15pm She responded, ""Just so you know your appt was at 2pm."" Meanwhile the receptionist came back and was speaking to the other nurses about another patient being late and how upset Dr. Mattai is going to be. I am irritated, but it's ok. The nurse takes my blood pressure and weight and asks me to wait in the hallway for her. She comes back and says ""the doctor will see you at 3:30pm because you are late and there are other patients in front of you.""  First of all, I actually would not have had a big issue waiting an hour or so for the doctor. That's not a great thing, but really not a big deal. However, that said, my head was about to blow off. I was continually spoken to as if I had broken some law. I was not spoken to with respect at any time. It was like I was an inmate and they were the guards. It was really like something out of a movie to watch the culture of this office, obviously fostered by Dr. Mattai. Having the nurse point out to me a third time, in as many minutes, that I was late was too much. I told her I no longer had any desire to see this doctor and I walked out. I never laid eyes on Dr. Mattai but I can tell you that I never care to do so. This is poor customer service at best and complete incompetency at worst. You have a choice in your health care and I would advise against choosing an office with such an utterly unprofessional and disrespectful disposition.

285,Dr. Jonathan D. Weaver,Los Angeles,California, Internists / Geriatricians , Male,2,5,2007-11-18T16:01:01Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Jonathan Weaver called to tell us our 35 year old son was on life support. We flew across country to be with our son and, when ready, to let him go. Jonathan (that is how he introduced himself) was the most wonderful doctor we have ever had or could ever have. He was kind, always available, answered all our questions with complete honesty and compassion. He made himself available to us day or night. His kindness, compassion, accessibility gave us so much comfort during the most painful time of our lives. I can't say enough about him. Our son died March 21, 2002. If he reads this, maybe he will remember our son, maybe not. But I have never had a more kind doctor in my life. My husband and I will never forget him. Not ever. Thank you Jonathan. We think of you so often--especially around March 21 of every year."

I stumbled upon him using UHC’s find a doctor tool (I was trying to find a doctor close to work). Finding a doctor like Dr. Khorrami is almost impossible, I know because I’ve been searching for a while. Dr. Khorrami is patient, caring and thorough. First Experience: Making the appointment was easy, and so are subsequent appointments. His staff is helpful and nice- pleasant if you will. I met with the doctor and he spent a great deal of time with me. Went over my symptoms, health, history and conducted a physical. He wanted to be thorough---not what I’m used to with other doctors. I have been seeing him about once a month (health related) and couldn’t be more satisfied with his care. Follow Up: Whenever I call or need anything, the office (including Dr. Khorrami) call me back. I had an issue with my insurance and Dr. Khorrami and his office worked diligently to make sure I got what I needed. I highly recommend Dr. Khorrami."

He said he appreciated it and he was planning to buy a mid sized island in Polynesia where I could come make an appointment any time. I guess I would go and see him again."

She is brilliant and she is great at follow up. She alwys returns calls and spends a lot of time answering all my questions. I feel lucky that I have a doctor that I can trust to provide the care that I need.

Yeung,Los Angeles,California, Internists / Geriatricians , Female,6,3.67,2011-02-26T14:51:05Z,2.3,5,2,1,1,"I agree with the other reviews that Dr. Yeung is neither warm nor knowledgeable. On my first visit to see her I was there for the very specific purpose of filling out a medical form for work. She did not read the form carefully and did not perform all of the necessary tests, resulting in a second visit (for which I was charged even though it was her mistake that I needed it). During my visits I felt like I was being handled by a ""used car salesperson"" because she insisted that I needed a slew of expensive vaccines in connection with my medical form, but I later learned that I did not. The next time I saw her was for a travel consult and she was not knowledgeable beyond the basic information that is listed on the CDC website, and I was informing her of what I needed. She treated me with a very patronizing attitude, and in the three times that I dealt with her, I felt as though she saw me more as a walking dollar sign rather than a patient."

She did not address my concern (a newly diagnosed health issue). Instead she spent the five minutes with me criticizing my weight. I am very mildly overweight 9 pounds on the BMI Chart. She also didn't respect that I had been loosing weight. I suggested she follow up with me in a few months to see the progress. She does not care or trust her patients.
317,Dr. Jennifer Y. Yeung,Los Angeles,California, Internists / Geriatricians , Female,6,3.67,2009-06-26T20:03:14Z,3.5,5,4,3,2,"Dr. Yeung advertises through my insurance that she also speacializes in Obstetrics and Gynecology. I went for annual exam where she informed me i had an abnormal growth on my cervix and said ""I've never seen this before"". I'll attribute that to inexperiance sure. She did suggest I seek out a second opinion which I greatly appreacited considering I went to a more experianced doctor to be told that I have a 100% healthy cervix. What she must have seen was folds on the cervix which are normal that every woman uniquley has. Cervical cancer runs in my family, so that was a good week of being very scared for nothing followed by a very uncomfortable lenghthy exam. Kudos to her though for suggesting I see someone else before I sought out treatment for something I didn't have."

She listens to my concerns. I trust her and think she is a great doctor. The only thing I don't like about my visits with her is that she's not particularly warm or caring, which is something that I personally really value."

I changed my medical group so that I could see specialists at Cedars, and so I picked Dr. Dick even though she had bad reviews on the internet. Dr. Dick introduced herself to me while she had her back to me as she closed the door. I was surprised that she's about 300 lbs and seemed very unhappy. I cried to her as I explained my condition and she showed no emotion. I brought her all of my prior medical records which after seeing her on the third visit, I could tell that she hadn't read one report. When I brought this to her attention she became cold and short. If you can avoid this doctor- do so at all costs! If you want someone with good bedside manners- then keep looking. I think that more patients should write feedback on their doctors so when a new patient needs assistance, we will be well prepared for what the doctor is all about. I changed my insurance to PPO so that I could see whatever specialist I like and keep my primary care physican."

Very attentive and polite and she seems to genuinely care about the patient as a human, not just a job."

She will always refer to a specialist if its something behind her realm of expertise. Good general practitioner."
323,Dr. Alice Ruth Dick,Los Angeles,California, Internists / Geriatricians , Female,5,3.8,2009-03-16T18:44:24Z,2,3,3,1,1,"I found her dismissive with a total lack of concern. I went to the ER with a blood clot & I actually had to tell her to refer me to a hematologist for blood clotting tests, to a cardiologist for an echo cardiogram, she wasn't the least bit concerned to find out why a healthy woman had a blood clot. When I told her that I had hot flashes, she tried to foist anti-depressants on me. I refused them, telling her I had hot flashes, not depression. I was appalled a woman would negate the symptoms of another woman. I should have known that a doctor who allowed herself to become so obese that she could not sit on the MD stool, but on the lid of the trash can, wasn't someone I wanted to manage my health. Awful."

He is rude, his staff is rude. I called his office for the first time for an emergency and he never called back. I went to the emergency and got good advice from a different doctor and again good advice from a second doctor on a follow up, but my medical group required me to get the specialist referrals from Nudelman. I needed a xray and MRI for a broken ankle. When I visited Nudelman I told him that I was in pain and swelling and numbness and nerve problem and he said I was fine and I told him I could not walk and he said rudely ""I think you can walk"", then I said I just need the referral for the MRI and he would not give it to me and again rudely said ""I'm not going to argue with you"". Months went by and the problem got worse. I called him he was not available. The next day he called me, and again, being rude he said ""I'm not your adviser"", then he said ""I don't work for you"", then he said ""you need a new doctor"", then hung up the phone... hung up the phone on me on his own call to me, it's not like he was busy because he called me. I spent the next two hours detailing a formal complaint to my medical insurance company. He gave me no pain meds, no advice on crutches or boot, and no referral for MRI. Three different doctors disagreed with him and his medical group apologized to me for his behavior."

He is the chairman of the Lupus Foundation and former head of Rheumatology at Cedar's. He has published 5 or 6 books on Lupus, some of which are required reading at medical schools. I was thankful to even get an appt with him. He can be quick, take a notepad with you and have questions ready. He books appts., every 15 minutes so don't expect to spend more than 10 with him, but he is VERY instinctive because of all the experience. Dr. Wallace is a prime example of how Doctor's should operate. He opens up at 7AM and responds to voicemails ASAP, more importantly to me, he responds to emails ASAP. He sends me literature and case studies on drugs that he has prescribed. Truly an expert doctor in his field and very modernized in his communication."

There's a few times when i lost my job and couldnt afford office visit where she waived the copay.

He sent me for a test at Cedars-Sinai with another doctor, which went very well, but he never called me back to say my insurance company had authorized next test (and it's been a month). He seemed nice enough the 5-minutes I saw him, but I think he is now involved with a practice that cares more about making money with gastric bypass surgery than with IBD and IBS patients.

When I was describing my symptoms to the doctor, he blurted out ""carcinoid!"" -- a type of stomach tumor. Having a doctor yell cancer at you while you are describing your symptoms is unpleasant. At the end of the session, the doctor told me my problem was ""very weird; I don't have an answer for you."""

Dr. Meth is a methodical and thorough physician when it comes to treating and diagnosing. He develops good treatment plans and is consistent. He's expects routine follow-up visits, monitoring your progress, and provides you with samples. I had asthma-bronchitis and didn't even know it.

I have never had a worse experience with a doctor and am glad I sought a second opinion. Dr. Sapkin completely disregarded my physical symptoms and didn't run the correct bloodwork. Instead, I was was told that I had anxiety issues and was given a prescription for a sedative. I left his office in tears that day. Thankfully, I sought a second opinion from another doctor and was treated with respect and care. I also received a proper diagnosis for Hypothyroidism and am currently in treatment. I strongly advise anyone to not visit Dr. Sapkin, there are many many other physicians in the Los Angeles area that are respectful of their patients and can provide excellent care."

I have a job. A life.Can I send them a bill for my hours that I sat there wasting away?I understand from time to time these things happen. I referred my boyfriend & a few others to him&was so embarrassed that he too waited over 2 hours to see him.He went out to feed the meter,upon returning was told that he missed the dr.&would have to wait again.He NEVER got to see him.I figured that was just a fluke-maybe an emergency came up- Its not.Its now become standard practice.Also stressing about the 2hour time limit at the meter,or about paying$22 for the lot.If he does spend time with his patients-its great.Get the idiots who book the appts. to adjust the appointment timing accordingly.Or give a heads up call or text that they are 2 hours behind.Dr.M can't be blind to this issue!"

My pharmacist alarmed me about a prescription that he had written for my mother but when I tried to contact him several times, he never responded or bothered to change the prescription. He is nice in the office but very poor follow-up routine once you leave the office. Extremely disappointed and immediately changed physicians after the error."

He has a superb reputation, hugely resepected by other doctors at UCLA. He spends plenty of time with me and my wife (we both go to him, separately, and like him). The problem is that we routinely have to wait an hour or more at our appointments. He always apologizes profusely. It appears to be a problem with his scheduling staff, who are indeed lame."

If anything needs an urgent attention but not emergency, you better heal yourself or pray. Even if you manage to get an appointment, you need to wait for him to show up at least 3 hours after the appointment time. Morover he is not helpful! Once I had a non-healing backpain for 2 months, I decided to see him. He said there are some patients dealing with more important problems than I have, and did not spend time for me. Some people are not good enough to be a doctor."

The worst part of an office visit to him is the super long wait. He is never on time but once he sees you, you are treated as if you were is only patient. He is well worth waiting for. If he doesn't know what is wrong with you, he is not afraid to refer you to a doctor that might help you. I love him, he is the BEST!"

He takes his patients 2-3 hours later than the appointment time. Once he did not even shop up. I know his time is valuable but he thinks the patients time is free. Very disrespectful. Not helpful either, some people said he is knowledgable... How do you know? He never has enough time to examine you carefully. I think he should do something else for living, being an MD is not only about making money but also taking care of people. Do not even pick him as your doctor. In your first appointment you might think that he is late but he will be ok next time. That next time never happens."

Copen,Los Angeles,California, Internists / Geriatricians , Male,10,2.7,2009-03-16T18:34:50Z,2.3,1,1,2,5,"He's brilliant but he has 2000 patients which includes a few practices in various areas of the city, plus he's a kidney specialist, so he has many diabetic patients in ER situations. A 3 hour wait is not unusual. He also returns calls near midnight. Very knowledgeable, but since he's so overwhelmed with 1000 too many patients, care falls through the cracks. Once you see him, it's the last time you can get him to return a phone call or pay attention. He also skimps on office help, which makes matters worst."

Yes, I've had to wait way beyond my appointment time, but that's because he doesn't rush his patients. He takes time to listen. A great doctor like this is worth waiting for."

I had a 630 pm appointment at his downtown office. I waited (no joke) until midnight to see him for a simple sick note. He wrote me the sick note with no problem, but then I was stuck downtown with no buses running at the time, so the whole visit cost me a lot more than what I expected. He is VERY knowledgable and helpful, I give him that. But it is inconvenient to make your patients wait this long."

This is because Dr. Copen spends as much time as needed with each patient, but it makes it frustrating when you need to plan your day around a doctor visit, especially when your days are very busy like mine."

The wait was about an hour in the waiting room after checking in ON TIME. Then it took about 35 minutes until the doctor came in so I actually fell asleep and that was a first. The doctor saw me for less than ten minutes and was rushing me out of the room. I felt that he was not attentive and incompetent. MY ADVICE: try another doctor because you will be disappointed and frustrated.

She has gone above and beyond with my care. After I had surgery she would call me daily for about two weeks to see how I was doing. Whenever I speak to an oncall doctor she calls the next day to see how I am doing. She is very knowledgable on any condition I have ever brought to her attention. She has been warm and compassionate, takes her time when I have a visit. She has been one of the best doctors I have ever used. I have recently had to change my insurance and was very upset that she was not on my new plan. To be honest I have been extremely disappointed with UCLA as a hospital and only stayed on as a patient because of Dr.Skinner. I have recommended her to people I love because she is someone that I trust with my life."

I don't get calls back on my tests (MRI, U/S, Mammo) and have had to rely on my derm to tell me what my test results were (they are online) that Skinner ordered. I have left her 5 messages in the past 5 weeks and she has still not returned my call. When I have various lumps in different places she will just say she doesn't know what they are or the tests are inconclusive. Sometimes she has her assistant Maria call with test results but she is not a doctor and has no idea what the results mean so cannot explain what the tests mean. I am looking for a new doc."

Did not examine me only wanted to send me for test she could get money for. Missed obvious things. You can tell she has either lost interest in her work or her ego is getting in the way of providing quality care. Her office staff follow her example by providing shoddy service. I would never recommend her to anyone.

She barely spent any time seeing me and when she did, her mind was evidently somewhere else. She barely looked me in the eyes when we spoke and seemed irritated and was short. She was supposed to do a yearly check-up as my insurance requires. She barely stuck the light up my nose, lightly swiped my glands and proceeded to do a pap. I knew she didn't do it correctly and what do you know, her nurse called me a week later to have a 're-do'. How about just a 'do'. I didn't bother going back bc I didn't want to deal with her attitude and incompetence again. I would NEVER recommend her."

I appreciate all that he did for me. I am on coumidan and heart medication now, and am feeling much better.

He is very knowledgeable and helpful. He is to the point, but takes his time explaining any questions you may have. I am very much to the point also, but need my questions answered and he does. He has a terrific sense of humor, which is a plus!"

His voice and manner are less abrasive. And he does not treat women like garbage - in fact he is nicer to them. Today when my husband had an appointment with him he (Hauptschein) was clearly having a bad day. As soon as we got out of the office my husband said he will never go back. I will, though. Strange as Hauptschein is, I like him and he's never been rude to me."

He recommended a treatment that worked for me that no other doctor has been able to figure out for the last year. he is kind and took his time with me. he is very thorough. his manner is different but I like it. it is straight and to the point and he doesn't put on any airs.

I don't know what crawled up his ass, but 1) it smells (literally, he needs to learn how to wipe properly) and 2) affects his mood for the worse. It's impossible to judge his knowledge because his bad attitude is in the way. He has a problem walking, which perhaps make him feel bitter toward everyone else. I went in to the office somewhat asymptomatic and he treated me like an idiot that was making it difficult for him to give me a diagnosis. I was apparently wasting his precious time. He was anxious to be done speaking with me. I told him about a muscle tear in my rib cage, and wondered if I needed something for it, and he goes ""I Don't know, you tell me."" WHAT!?!?! Who does that!?!! How is he still in practice!??! What an ass. Not only that, but he has Old Testament rubbish hanging on the walls and treats his staff like garbage, and appears to treat women like garbage. I'm glad I don't know him personally."
547,Dr. Martin Hauptschein,Los Angeles,California, Internists / Geriatricians , Male,7,2.68,2011-05-12T17:40:22Z,1,1,1,1,1,Dr. Hauptschein needs to wash before coming to work.He has strong offensive body odor. He changed my prescriptions to have no refills so that I now I have to go back to the clinic again just to have my meds refilled. I complained about my IBS and asked if he knew of anything other than librax he suggested activia yogurt and then he ordered a pregnancy test which I refused because I am bloated and 53 yrs. old and in menopause. He also ordered a test for vitamin d and a tetanus shot. Random nonsense that was a waste of my time. I waited 40 minutes because I needed my blood pressure and other meds refilled. After seeing me for 7 aggravating minutes he said I had to see my regular physician in order to get more than a single refill. The NP I saw the last time gave 3 refills so I know this was just what this doctor randomly decided to do and it has affected my life negatively because I have run out of my meds again and still don't have another appointment scheduled.

York,Los Angeles,California, Internists / Geriatricians , Male,4,3.63,2009-11-03T17:57:37Z,2.8,3,4,2,2,"Aside from the fact that Dr. York just appears slovenly, his office and staff do not inspire trust. His nurse is either too dumb or too lazy to understand the process of faxing information to a pharmacy and Dr. York twice prescribed medication to which I was allergic. The first time was a sample he gave me, that created migraines for a month. The pharmacist caught the contra-indication to a different prescribed medication the second time. I never went back to Dr. York after that, fearing for my life. If a doctor pays no attention to your allergies, can you really trust him??"

York,Los Angeles,California, Internists / Geriatricians , Male,4,3.63,2009-10-20T14:06:27Z,4.8,5,4,5,5,"When I lost the ability to see my old internist due to insurance change I was really afraid that I would not be able to find someone as good as my last doctor. Well, I did! Dr. York is fabulous, always takes his time with each patient and really sits and listens to what you have to say. He genuinely tries to help his patients. I highly recommend him!"
551,Dr. Steven W. York,Los Angeles,California, Internists / Geriatricians , Male,4,3.63,2006-10-27T19:07:04Z,5,,5,5,5,Dr York is very thourough and listens to your concerns. I have been to a few other doctors where the wait has been 1 to 2 hours. When you make an appointment you rarely have to wait more than 10 minutes. I highly recommend this doctor if you are seeking medical help.

He has like 500 patients, but he always makes me feel like I'm the only one. Answers emails and phone calls. Goes the extra mile to find out what is wrong and the best treatment possible. Have seen him for over 5 years and have NO complaints whatsoever.."

Yet he ALWAYS has time to promptly return a call, cordially focus on each of his patients needs, or otherwise remind us that personal care and attention are a large part of the cure. Add to this his enormous font of experience and clinical knowledge, and he becomes an invaluable resource to me and my family."

SAYAH,Los Angeles,California, Internists / Geriatricians , Male,1,4.75,2013-08-12T14:54:50Z,4.8,5,4,5,5,"The office staff was very courteous and professional and made it easy to schedule both a consult and my surgery. Dr Sayah was very kind and patient and answered all of my questions in advance. He also seemed genuinely concerned with my comfort and satisfaction before, during and after surgery. My surgery went as expected, as did the recovery. When I came back for check ups I went right in with no wait and really felt like a valued client. I highly recommend Dr Sayah overall, and specifically for face work. I first met him 6 years ago and he cautioned me not to take surgery lightly, but to wait until I really felt I was sure I wanted to do it. I appreciated his conservative approach and that he was not trying to convince me to do anything or rush into it. To me, that's the sign of a confident and quality doctor."

He will actually listen to you without making you feel rushed...he will run the necessary diagnostic tests without putting the insurance company first (but he is not wasteful, nor will he just prescribe things without reason), and he will actually think about your care outside of your visit hours. He's called me before just to check in on how I was doing. "

I am a fairly healthy late 30's male. It was tough choosing a primary care physician in the Kaiser system, as they give you very little to go on to make your choice. I feel lucky to have found Dr. Mehlman at a time when he was taking on new patients. He is attentive, has great bedside manner, respectful of the patient. I told him 4 or 5 things I was worried about at my last physical. He made a plan for me, gave me some goals and wants to check in with me in 6 months. Very personal care for a Kaiser system that can seem quite cold and impersonal."

He listens thoughtfully, gives evidence-based advice, is thorough and incredibly responsive. My visits have been as short or long as my needs have warranted. He has helped me sort through multiple conditions, communicates with my other providers, and does not chastise me about needing to lose weight or exercise. He obviously cares about my quality of life and not just the clinical indicators, because he has been flexible in changing my medications if there is a side effect I cannot tolerate. He always treats me with respect and kindness. I cannot say enough good things about him. And on top of all this, he runs on time!"
563,Dr. Baldeep Singh,Palo Alto,California, Internists / Geriatricians , Male,3,3.92,2007-03-27T00:22:57Z,5,,5,5,5,"I am a health care professional with a very complicated medical history. Dr. Singh has been very patient and knowledgeable in sorting out my treatment and referring me to other specialists when needed. He discusses treatment options with me rather than just handing me a prescription. He always calls after I have lab work done to discuss the results, even if the tests are negative. When I have called after hours with an emergency, I have received a prompt response. I have found him to be a very intelligent and compassionate physician."
564,Dr. Baldeep Singh,Palo Alto,California, Internists / Geriatricians , Male,3,3.92,2007-03-18T22:19:06Z,1.7,,3,1,1,"I'm just not very happy with a medical professional that shrugs his shoulders and says ""I don't know"" and then charges you. This has happened more than once for me with Dr. Singh."

He always makes me feel at ease, and he is so knowledgable. He helped me when my previous dr. could not, and he helped me over the years & isn't that most important. I am so lucky to have him as my Dr. He knows me and my file and listens."

Nudelman,Los Angeles,California, Internists / Geriatricians , Male,2,3.63,2014-05-15T19:37:23Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Nudelman is patient and makes sure he's covered all your health related questions. He is also very efficient and checks on previous health conditions and asks about current concerns. Although all doctors working for an HMO have a busy schedule, I never feel rushed with this doctor, while I have felt rushed in the past with other doctors. He has a quiet and relaxed manner that puts you at ease."

At first, he was very nice and dedicated and explained things to me. Recently, within the past year; I became displeased with him. He seemed disinterested in me as a patient. He would not answer my health related questions or refer me to other Kaiser doctors regarding my health conditions and prescribed medication that made me feel worse and had terrible side effects. About 3 or 4 months ago; I changed to a different Kaiser doctor. If you are a Kaiser patient of Dr. Nudelman and are having similar problems with him; I would suggest you contact Member Service and request a different doctor."

Dr. Charette is my 90 year old mother's doctor and has been for several years. She is, by far, the most intelligent, intuitive and compassionate doctor she's ever seen and that includes all specialists. She takes her time with each patient (which might explain the alleged 45 minute wait, although we've always been seen within 15 minutes of appointment time) and thoroughly explains her decisions and diagnosis. Her analysis is complete with such things as memory and walking tests and I've always felt assured that my mother was in the best hands as all problems and concerns have always been addressed, sometimes before they become problems. I've since recommended her to several people all have raved. Dr. Charette is, in my opinion, the top doctor at the #3 Geriatrics practice in the USA. You will not find a better physician than her."

Made comments that made me question her knowledge in medicine. No bedside manner because she never comes to see you in the hospital which is a 5 minute walk. Sends other doctors to see you in the hospital who have NO bedside manner and should be sent back to medical school for a crash course in talking to patients without terrorizing them. She is Sweet and nice if you are looking for a wonderful fun girlfriend to hang with.

A ""God Complex"" with not much real life experience is a dangerous thing when your doctor regurgiatates verbatim exactly as she has been told to do without exercising any thought process of her own - although she will wait politely to hear what you have to say before continuing on as if you never uttered a word"

She is willing to take care of any problems I am having and her staff is very friendly. I usually get there early and seen within 10 minutes prior to my appointment time.

I have dealt with a number of miscommunications that have led to my utter frustration. I have also been prescribed medications or referred to other specialists without any explanation. My initial exam was very rushed and there was no follow up by the doctor. She seems to have a nice personality but I do not believe I am receiving quality care and seeking a new physician."

The only drawback is patients do have to wait as he's always running late....this is because he doesn't rush patients' appointments. Our adult kids are his patients now.

He claims that he takes your insurance , but asks that you pay the fee at the rate he would charge as if you didn't have insurance, and says that he will refund the difference once your insurance company processes the claim.

I went to him to have my BP tested before a surgery. 4 months after the surgery, I was experiencing severe anxiety that I felt was raising my BP and I called the office to ask for a refill of the Diovan he had prescribed before my surgery. He refused, saying that my comments about my anxiety related issues were probably from fibromyalgia, a disease I don't have. He said I had to come in for more tests (natch) and that's when I pulled the plug. I called his office later and fired him and said that to diagnose me over the phone was unconscionable medical procedure. In an effort to ""make up"" for his mistake, he called me 2 weeks later as if nothing was wrong and said it was time to get more BP medicine. He is greedy and a typical money grubbing doctor who has no interest in helping those with no resources."

I have found Dr. Weinberg to be a brilliant genius of a doctor. I don't care how long I have to wait ( I bring my own book or magazine). He does not rush people. Doctors who are on time and see a ton of patients, one after the other don't listen to their patients, don't analyze their cases..they are after the money is my opinion, they want to get people in and out assembly line and just prescribe a med and be done. Diagnosing must be like detective work. You have to take the time to figure out the person and their mind and body. This is what he does. Also, he has years of experience but still is up to date on the latest info possible and loves what he does. You can tell by how he treats his patients. My whole family goes to him and feel very lucky to have found him."

I had a nagging knee pain that was getting worse. THe wait was very long and just as I was about to leave, (I had already waited over an hour), another patient who was also waiting advised me to stay saying she has been coming for the last 10 years and always had to wait this long. I'm glad I heeded her advise. I believe Dr. Weinberg saved my life, for while I came for a joint pain, he pointed out to me other medical issues that were more concerning: I had uncontrolled blood pressure and sugars, my cholesterol was in the high 200's. I won't die of the joint pain, he pointed out, but I will die of a heart attack if I didn't do anything about it. 3 years later, I still sit at his office and wait my turn, because my numbers have never been better ever and I have never felt so good. He looks at the total picture and takes his time and his knowledge is current. And how's my joint pain? What joint pain? Higly recommended!!!"

My mom was diagnosed with End stage liver disease. Dr. Mishal was amazing. She took alot of time to explain the disease to us. We did have to wait a while, but I did not feel we were rushed out and she took the time to see and give full understanding of what was going on so it was well worth the wait. There should be more doctors like her."

Sanna,Los Angeles,California, Internists / Geriatricians , Female,5,2.55,2013-11-12T15:44:12Z,3,5,2,2,3,"Dr. Sanna doesn't really seem to make much of an effort to establish rapport with her patients. She walked in late, apologized in a monotone voice and proceeded with a very matter of fact, distant series of questioning. Which I guess you might expect from a Dr seeing patient after patient, bored with the routine. I'm sure she is very knowledgeable, but didn't really include me in her thought processes e.g. What she was doing, why she was doing it or what to expect. If you don't mind an in and out, straight to the point experience being just another inanimate patient on the table and don't need to know what's going on, then Dr Sanna is fine. But if this makes you feel like you're not getting your time's worth, and want to be able to know what's going on without feeling like you are imposing, then see if you can find a doctor recommended by your friends."

Sanna,Los Angeles,California, Internists / Geriatricians , Female,5,2.55,2012-01-12T05:00:36Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Because my primary doctor was booked up for weeks after the Christmas holidays, I was given an ""urgent care"" appointment with Dr. Sanna in the UCLA Geriatrics Division in Santa Monica. I was half an hour late, but she was still able to see me. Her questions and examination were thorough, her manner professional yet pleasant. Because she was unable to come up with a definitive diagnose of my problems she ordered blood tests and xrays, the results of which were given to my primary care physician. I recommend her highly."

Sanna,Los Angeles,California, Internists / Geriatricians , Female,5,2.55,2011-08-24T16:50:40Z,1.5,3,1,1,1,"Dr. Sanna walked in late, gave me a look of disdain, didn't bother to introduce herself, and sat down at the computer with her back to me while speaking. She washed her hands and didn't bother to dry them before examining my injury, which was uncomfortable. She offered generic advice I could have looked up myself, and referred me to someone else as fast as she could. She ended the appt by leaving without saying anything at all. WORST doctor experience I have ever had. If you get scheduled to see her, request ANYONE else. Her overall demeanor was unprofessional and she acted like she just didn't give a crap and couldn't wait to leave. Not the kind of person you would trust to take care of you when you're sick or injured."

I have multiple health issues which he has worked very dilligently to manage, the results are my chronic conditions are well controlled. He also literally saved my life when during a telephone call he realized that I was having a heart attack and he pushed me to get to Cedars. By the time I got there, he had arranged for a top cardiologist to manage my case. Dr. Defren came to the hospital at least 2 times a day. His cajoling and education efforts resulted in my changing my lifestyle and being healthier than I have been in years. I can't recommend him enough."

I do not recommend him to anyone who has a difficult health problem of any kind. He will lie in your face and lie to other doctors if he does not know the answer. He is unwilling to dig deeper into a case and will not read your history. Not worth the trouble and time going to him.

First of all, I was made to wait inside the waiting room for over 45 minutes every time (and over an hour many times). During a couple of times I heard the Doctor chit chat on the phone (clearly friend/family). I think this is unfair to the patient waiting - we all take time off work and come to the appointment. Second, she really gives a lot of her ""personal"" advice and thoughts - like ""oh you are fine"", ""you are just stressed out"" while I was in fact not. Eventually after doing a battery of unrelated tests, she sent me home with a ridiculous painkiller dosage (which I obviously did not take). Eventually I got an appointment at a better hospital and got treated for my problem in a professional manner in lesser time than I spent at her office."

Kumar,Los Angeles,California, Internists / Geriatricians , Female,3,2.67,2012-07-05T09:46:53Z,2,5,1,1,1,"This doctor left me waiting for over 1.5hr after my appointment, even though I showed up 1/2hr earlier. She left the door open why she asked my what was wrong, waved her own personal feelings in my face, and then tried to send me to 3 different specialists (an additional $50 each on my insurance). If you're too incompetent to do anything yourself, please have your staff let me know before I make an appointment to waste my time and money. I had a wonderful doctor before my HMO decided she was no longer in the network, so they assigned me this hack instead. I guess private insurance really doesn't provide choice after all. When I was leaving, even the staff said I should change doctors."

Super ADD, doesn't even talk about you condition, expectations nor how to move forward from where you are, instead he likes to talk about your iphone, the weather, the view out the window and then you leave, without ANY information. Terrible bed side manners... I do not understand how he has so many patients at USC. Probably because he never heals them and has them coming back for years. Def. a doctor that is more ore about the business of ""healthcare"" than the wellbeing of the patients."

A cholesterol exam is common during physicals. It is also common to ask patients to not eat prior to a cholesterol exam (I was not aware of this). Despite this, I was given an appointment right after lunch and I wasn't asked to come in on an empty stomach. During my appointment, the doctor even asked me if I had eaten recently, to which I said yes. Despite this, the doctor asked for the cholesterol exam to be conducted. When the results came back, my cholesterol levels were off the charts. The doctor's ASSISTANT called me, told me my cholesterol levels were DANGEROUSLY high and that I should immediately come in for a second exam and this time I should come in on an empty stomach. MY INSURANCE DID NOT COVER THE SECOND EXAM. So I sought advice from friends in the medical profession and I was told that given my age and otherwise good health, my cholesterol levels were probably high because of the meal."

In addition, she diagnosed me with dysmenorrhea instead of ordering an ultrasound to see what could be the cause of my unbearable cramping and heavy bleeding during menstruation. Even knowing my mother had a history of severe uterine fibroids and they're hereditary.

Staff is unfriendly and unknowledgeable about what health insurance plans they accept. 3. Alan himself, while only working limited hours, does not spend his time reading up on current literature and studies, and therefore is not up-to-date with the most recent medical findings; when I know more than he does, its a problem! 4.

Dr. Farzam is an excellent doctor, with excellent diagnostic skills. He knows exactly to treat your problem, and always follows up to make sure everything is ok. Dr. Farzam is a good choice for people who are home bound, have a crazy schedule, or don't want to sit in a dr.'s office full of sick people. He knows what he is doing and has excellent connections in the community. I couldn't recommend him more highly."

Took me 3 calls to get her to call back. (She blamed the reception staff for not giving her my message.) Had to make an appt to see her face to face... in the end... she was truly clueless. She never ran additional tests, didn't understand the med she put me on and couldn't answer any questions. I am now seeing a specialist because I have never recovered from the meds she put me on. The most bothersome thing... she knows how sick I became after she put me on those meds and NEVER contacted me to see how I am doing. Even feigned interest would have been appreciated."

Little did I know that her education has absolutely no influence on her helpfulness as a dr. I wasnt expecting much from internal medicine, maybe some Rx for things like Retin-a, maybe order to get some lab tests done. And since my insurance is HMO, i def. expected some lag time for referrals for specialists and such. What i wasnt expecting was for that to apply when I needed to see a specialist quickly. I had some abnormal bleeding, but my obgyn told me i needed a authorization. I called the PCP and told them of my condition, and they said the dr would see me TWO WEEKS LATER. And if my condition worsens? I ****ed, and they told me the dr would call. Her nurse called. ""Dr said you should go to emergency"" Like I couldnt self-diagnose that??? I had to fight with the nurse to give me a referral to a specialist. Overall grade? D"

I moved to NJ shortly after, and in 2007 underwent a coronary stent procedure. The regular bi-yearly tests after that were not satisfying because of the impersonalized but expensive service. So in July 2010 when I was visiting Los Angeles, I went back to her for the yearly EKG stress test. She showed me the printout and explained how there was something a bit suspicious and gave elaborate advice, then scheduled me for an Echocardiogram and a Thallium Stress test. Since I was leaving LA in 5 days, she instructed her staff to arrange with the hospital for an accelerated schedule. And right after the test, she appeared at the hospital and conferred with the resident cardio, and there and then gave me the results that I had no ischemia. She has lots of patients which however can cause a little understandable delay."

She is a disgrace to the medical profession and an affront to the Hippocratic Oath. I echo the other reviews regarding her rudeness, even disdain, for patient. I went to her at the recommendation of my parents. She was condescending and useless. Unfortunately, my criticism of her was not enough to keep my parents away. She could not be more responsible for my father's untimely death if she had put a gun to his head and pulled the trigger. The short version of our long nightmare story:She gave my father Coumadin,a BLOOD THINNER,for what she diagnosed as atrial fib, KNOWING THAT HE HAD A (Stable) Subdural Hematoma. The AF was secondary to the Hematoma.She was too incompetent to know that. After a dose or two of the Coumadin the hematoma exploded.She then ALTERED her records to cover up her incompetence. We had the original hospital records to prove it. The neurosurgeon never knew it b/c he relied on her records."

The receptionist came in with the doc and told me they dont work with AETNA anymore. The doc didnt even say hello, or didnt even apologize for wasting my time for almost a month and keeping me in pain for a month (i had to wait a month to schedule an apptm).

That completely messed up my schedule, but I really needed to be seen so I abliged. When I got there, I waited forever to be seen. Then finally the doctor came into the room, no smile, no hello, nothing. She didn't ask me any questions and was very rude. I felt completely rushed (because she had another meeting to go to). I requested that she take my blood test for diabetes, cholesterol,since it runs in my family. About 1 week later, I still didn't hear anything from the doc's office, so i called and they informed me that my results came in and she would fax them over to me. The results were all coded and I didn't understand how to read them. The doctor refused to go over the results with me! It wasn't until a month later that I found out about my high cholesterol.

So he gave me a long lecture on why he has to give me the mildest form of the medicine. He is right, but his attitude could definitely use some work. That’s the third strike for me.

He said the meds would have worked so I was doing it to myself-- making myself throw up. He refused to even look at the medical research studies on CVS. I went straight from his office to the ER after he rudely insisted it was in my head. I was in admitted to the hospital for 5 nights. If you want any empathy & a doctor who is more concern with your well-being than his medications working (ego), avoid this doctor.

Dr. Galfayan had evidence in my blood tests for over two years of what was wrong with me, but she either lied to me in the hopes that I would get sicker and eventually die, or she's blind and incompetent, or she just doesn't give a darn about patients and she got into medicine for the money.

It didn't help that they claimed they've never had a patient who owned an SUV or truck - the parking had a ridiculously low height limit. Then, they said it was my own fault for not magically knowing about the limit. I specifically asked about parking when I made my appointment and was told it was a lot with parking right out front. Why would a lot have a height limit - why would I even think about that for a lot? I now need to suffer for another couple weeks while I wait for an appointment with another doctor.

Went in for shoulder / ankle issues, ear issues, and a request for an allergy panel. Allergy panel request completely ignored. Took one month+ for referral to be sent - this could have been insurance companies fault but unsure. Was told referral request would be sent again once I had this corrected. Was not sent. Called to have it re-sent. Over 5 weeks later, received info for referral. Went to x-ray lab, referrals had not been sent. Had to call and have them faxed. Also asked her to fax orders to ortho and ENT. Found out next day they were not. Had to call and have her re-send. Verified she had correct number, evidently she did not as after I gave it to her, she sent it again.
Ortho received order, was told it was only for shoulder. Ankle would not be examined. This was biggest issue I had, and now its another appt, more wait time (over 1+ hour wait last time), with physician.
If you like babysitting the entire process between your physician, the admin of the doctor's office, insurance and the specialists, you've come to the right place. Sadly, at this point, zero acknowledgement of any oversight / mistakes from anyone. Additional note - I'm a first time patient and this was my first visit.

As I was trying to explain when I have seizures (50 in all) and the circumstances surrounding most, he interrupted me when I stated that MISSING a DOSE of the medicine caused many, as if my body had become addicted to the medicine somehow, even though the drugs are not addicting, in theory. I objected when he said that was not the reason. He antagonized me further when I stood up. It was obvious he did not possess knowledge of the side-effects of taking Dilatin(phenytoin) and Keppra. One such side-effect is irritability and outbursts. Having witnessed such outburst, a seasoned doctor would have resolved the situation more professionally than KICKING ME out of his OFFICE and asking that I be banned from returning. I HAVE BEEN A PATIENT AT USC/LA County Hospital for 5 years and have had several doctors. Mr. Mesbah is by far the worst."

I was told the machine malfunctioned. (I would have hoped they were proactive to let me know instead of me waiting around for 7 days).

My dad has been in the care of this doctor for over 30 years. Since December 2016, my dad has lost drastic weight and has been in excruciating pain. The doctor sent him for a CT scan back in April 2017. He even told my dad that there is nothing wrong with his back and issued a prescription for a back brace and a cane. So my dad continued on with his pain. He was not able to eat or sleep due to the constant pain in his lower back and both side of his legs. I told my dad to give permission to the doctor to speak to me.
So When I saw my dad in May 2017, he has lost even more weight than when I saw him in April. I contacted the doctor's office to find out what is wrong with my dad and needed to speak with him to understand. His extremely rude staff just keep quoting ""the Law"". They can't speak to me because the Law. I know all about HIPAA and that is why I had asked my dad to give them permission. But the refused.
Meanwhile, the report from the CT scan indicated that my dad has Metastatic bone disease. How is it that this doctor does not know what that mean and the urgency to get my dad to a real professional.
So I decided to take my dad to my primary care doctor. Dr. Somani. Doctor Somani told me that the reason for my dad's pain was due to the cancer that is growing in his bones. That's what she got from the CT report.
Apparently the tumor in his bone has caused a fracture in his spine as well and he's not able to sit, walk, sleep or eat. So immediately Dr. Somani ordered that my dad go to urgent care. She had contacted the hospital to make all the arrangements for my dad so when I got there the hospitalist Dr. Tiwana already knew what needs to be done. Dr. Somani even contacted the Pulmonary doctor as well since my dad had a mass in his lung.
Long story short, it turns out that my dad's cancer has spread all over his lungs and his bones . God knows where else it has spread. This could have been caught early on if this incompetent doctor didn't ignore my dad's complaint of pain.
What's worst is that he treats older people. These seniors trusted him and he betrayed their trust. Who knows how many elderly person died under his negligent."

During her stay and under the care of Dr. Rudo Benjamin, Carl Feld and David Scott at LCM my mother was severely edematous, was having kidney failure and was having a hard time breathing. Seeing her condition worsening, I requested for her to be released from LCM.
Unfortunately the only way for my mother to be transported to my house was through hospice and I had no choice but to enroll her through Trinity Hospice.
Based on test results that I was able to obtain after my mother's death, I learned my mother was administer vancomycin at toxic levels. Based on what I read, one of the side effects of vancomycin in the elderly is decreased or closing of renal function and that is exactly what was happening to my mother. This information was never related to me on her release or thereafter. Had I been notified of this, I would have had the opportunity to take her to another hospital.
I still do not know what bacterial infection they were treating because based on her both blood culture test came back negative.
During her care through Trinity Hospice, I requested a blood test to see how her electrolyte and ammonia levels were. The hospice doctor refused to authorize the blood test and would only authorize if I paid for it. Payment for me was the never the issue. She gave me the prescription but did not provide the services. My mother was bed-bound, so attempting the process of getting this service was not easy. Unfortunately, I was never able to get this done because my mother's condition worsened and she passed away.
It is my believe that under LCM and Trinity Hospice's care contributed to my mother's death."
