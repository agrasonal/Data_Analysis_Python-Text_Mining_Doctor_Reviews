The past few years I have had a lot of issues hit me at once. He was always quick to pull in specialists when needed, and he would check in with them to find out what is going on and relay information back. He is hesitant to jump to medication for solutions, but he takes appropriate action when needed. He is also extremely friendly and enjoyable to talk to. "

I have never felt so comfortable or well-treated by a doctor before. She sees me at the time I am scheduled or earlier.

She came highly recommended to me by a friend and I am absolutely satisfied with her as my OBGYN Doc. She is thorough during our appointments and genuinely caring. There is always an opportunity to ask questions and she explains things really well so I know the pros and cons of what is happening and options that I have available. I also appreciate the ""mychart"" service offered through Swedish and have found it to be a great way to ask questions straight to Dr. Mayhill rather than having to relay them through the phone staff. I have read the reviews on this site and am surprised at the few negative reviews as I can't relate as I have had a wonderful experience. I have recommended Dr. Mayhill to a few friends and all have reported positive experiences and are thankful for the referral."

30,Dr. Marty P. Ross,Seattle,Washington, Family Doctors / G.P.s , Male,46,3.51,2019-04-25T22:58:06.833Z,1,1,1,1,1,"Mr. Ross now. Short synopsis of why he lost his MD licenses to practice in both California & Washington State: was because of mis-use of sleep Rx medication at unheard of doses with a patient who was suicidal & this (is known for) worsening that too, and he had not checked to see if that was an issue. His losing his licenses in 2 states had to do with complete wrong & negligent use of a prescription medication in ways that no physicians are using anywhere for lyme or anything else.
It had zero to do with any supplements, herbs, or integrative or alternative treatment, despite his tall tale saying this is the case. It is not. Nor did that flag the states to investigate further because the malpractice was so extreme it was enough on its own and he was not able to provide the medical boards with anything that documented similar treatment, by colleagues, or studies, or anything to back up what he had been doing. Because there was nothing. What he did was 100% unfounded and negligent use of a prescription sleep medication. Was the patient defending him?, heck NO. I know the patient. The patient reported him, to the pharmacy and medical board after being basically dismissed/fired as a patient likely because Mr. Ross was realizing the liability of his major mistake & mess up, so wiped his hands clean of the patient hoping it would make it all just go away. It seems he made a regular practice of this with patients he considered a risk for one reason or another. This time it caught up with him. About time it did. His whole tale and whoa is he regarding what he presents having happened, is truly a ""tall tall tale"" as they say in TX where he slunk off to. Hopefully he never regains a license to practice medicine anywhere ever again."
31,Dr. Marty P. Ross,Seattle,Washington, Family Doctors / G.P.s , Male,46,3.51,2019-04-17T01:17:04.214Z,1,1,1,1,1,"I know Mr. Ross is in Texas now and I've read 'His Story' on why. If you are really interested in him and his treatments, I suggest you look deeper and don't accept his version of events. I have not seen the man in many years but I am still so angry about his treatment of my sister that I decided to post on the off chance someone might see this and be warned to take care. As others have said, he gave incredibly high and dangerous doses of antibiotics in attempts to mimic the results of IV antibiotics. For example, if you had bronchitis, you might be told to take 500 mgs of this particular drug once, possibly twice a day. He had my sister taking nine (9) 500 mgs a day. Instead of taking 500 to 1,000 mgs a day, she was taking 4500 mgs of this particular antibiotic. Fortunately another Dr told her how dangerous it was and to stop taking them asap. Then he prescribed another antibiotic called Ciprofloxacin, which can gravely danger some people who take it and has been black boxed twice in the US. Drs are told to prescribe it only if no other antibiotic will work. It is to be used as a last ditch effort if nothing else is available. She was on it for 3 months and thought she was herxing. It wasn't until she had a phone conversation with him that he said That's not herxing; It's the Cipro doing that to you.. She lost all mobility in one arm and roughly 10 yrs later can still only raise that arm slightly. She is in chronic pain and for all intents and purposes, is bedridden. Here's the kicker: that phone call that she had with him where she described what was going on with her and he told her it wasn't the Lyme causing it but rather the Cipro, he suddenly said he couldn't speak with her anymore even though she had a 30 min phone conversation booked with him and 7 mins had passed. She said Dr. Ross, what should I do, what should I take...he said Take Magnesium and hung up. Then his receptionist called back to get a credit card to pay the 30 min session which was really 7 mins. I explained to her what had happened and that I needed to speak with Dr. Ross asap to find out how to treat my sister; she was in awful pain. He used to have a messaging service that all his patients could write to him on . I called the office several times, left msgs for him, and I also sent him msgs on this client msging service. I emailed to no avail. If I called the office, they would either hang up or say he wasn't available. I told him in my msgs that we meant no harm, we weren't going to sue, we just wanted to know how we should treat the damage to her from this antibiotic. I can guarantee this wasn't a case of us being problematic patients, or that we had threatened to sue...how could we when we never even spoke to him. The fact is, he was to blame in not warning her that she could have these serious side effects from the medication and to stop taking it if these effects happened but honestly, we weren't thinking about where to assign blame; we just wanted help for my sister. I'm sure he was worried that he would be sued so rather than do the decent thing and try to make things right, he fled. I msgd him, I phoned him, I emailed him desperate for help and I never heard from him again. Rumor had it that he was in hot water with his treatment of some of his patients and the ILADS took him off their list of recommended doctors. I don't know what he is doing now, selling supplements and books and doing podcasts it would seem. All I can say is If you see him for treatment or listen to his podcasts, don't do anything without checking first with a reputable doctor. If anyone knows the real circumstances of his sudden departure to Texas or, I hope they will share it. I don't believe he is an honorable man and the truth will come to light eventually."

NOT due to a witch hunt of lyme literate doctors. How can he even be listed and ranked here without legaly being able to see patients?

He has made such a diffence and helped her recover over the last year to where she is back working again full time. It is worth her time traveling from Northern California to get the care she has needed. Thank you for helping so many that can’t get the help they need elsewhere.

Ross,Seattle,Washington, Family Doctors / G.P.s , Male,46,3.51,2018-04-20T19:43:55.737Z,1,1,1,1,1,"This man has ruined more people's lives than he could ever get to put up ""nice reviews"" for him. I'm an advocate and will not recommend someone who left ILADS in a snit because they wouldn't put him on the board. I will not recommend someone who has tried to replicate IV doses in oral medications, and then fired the patient when he put them in the hospital. I will not recommend someone who insists patients bring him gifts, items I know he throws into the back office and never looks at again because I saw them pile up with my own eyes. I will not recommend someone who thinks Shamanic Journeying is ""really no more than a guided meditation"" - his exact words to me rather than, ""I travel into the Spirit Realm and retrieve the lost and broken parts of the soul"" that he tells current patients. I will not recommend someone who fires the patients he gets into trouble with and cannot cure. I cannot recommend a doctor whose floors are so dirty that service dogs and service dogs in training have come up with acupuncture needles in their coats and enough dust to kick up a patients allergy. He was a great doctor a long time ago before he lost his way. It's very sad to see him lose his humility and the passion for helping Lyme and HIV/AIDS (etc) patients. I personally wish him well, but would never recommend another chronically ill patient go see him. It is, at the least, a waste of money and, at the most, dangerous."

Not one of them knew how to help me get better and instead one Lyme specialist made me so sick I was given a hospice order. I did not have long to live but somehow we found Dr. Ross. He is the best doctor I have ever known. He is very compassionate, extremely knowledgable, and listens to me.... which is hard to find. He gives of his time with his weekly webinars where you can ask questions about health related issues for free. He works with me and it truly is a partnership. I would have died without him and now I am about 80% better and gettting my Life back! I can fully take care of myself after three years of 24 hour care. I wish that all in need could find a doctor like him.,because we need more like him. Forever grateful! "

She treated me for a variety of things during that time and was always friendly and made me feel very comfortable. She also advised me to use the nettie pot and for years now it has worked wonders. I miss having her as my doctor.
44,Dr. Holly Bays,Seattle,Washington, Family Doctors / G.P.s , Female,9,4.14,2009-06-08T09:20:26Z,4.5,3,5,5,5,"I'm puzzled by why the previous poster would go to a Physician for a dental issue? I wouldn't go to a mechanic to get my computer repaired. My wife and I have been thrilled with the service we've received from Holly for years now. So much so that we have continued to see her after moving out of the neighborhood, because she's worth the extra travel. For that matter, we've been frustrated often with the efficiency of the clinic's clerical personnel, but couldn't bring ourselves to give up Holly's exceptional skill and caring bedside manner. Rarely would I overlook such complaints, but she really does make it worthwhile. Going to see her is more like visiting a friend than seeing some distant and uncaring medical professional. Not to imply that she lacks professionalism or knowledge, only that she shows genuine concern and friendliness. She also will often suggest natural or holistic approaches - she recommended I try a Nettie pot when I was having ongoing sinus problems."

48,Dr. Holly Bays,Seattle,Washington, Family Doctors / G.P.s , Female,9,4.14,2005-12-08T20:26:33Z,2.7,,4,2,2,"When suffering from severe pain due to an abscessed molar that had been recently filled or 'capped' over she offered no relief but handed me an OTC (over the counter) sample that had no effect. When later I contacted Dr. Bays about the constant severe, terrible, unremitting pain and that I was unable to sleep or rest as ice chips were needed constantly she said to me, ""that according to the information on the box it should have been just fine"". She left me suffering for 2 days and 3 nights over the weekend until a friend stopped by and me unable to speak, focus my eyes or stand due to the pain and drove me to a hospital emergency dental care unit. I'm more reports of this kind where Doctors are afraid of using the tried and true pain medications due to fear of reprisals from the Drug Enforcement Agency who have the power to take away their license to prescribe. After all, that’s pretty much all the doctors have, a prescription pad."

Specifically, how to manage a coordinated (with other MS neuropathic specialists)approach to managing both conditions, the associated drug treatments and the potential for misscommunication on dealing with potentially powerful and mixed drug treatments. She was 30 minutes late to a half hour appointment and seemed to take a disliking to our questions and concerns related to a coordinated drug treatment program given we have been on an MS treatment program for several months. Given the seriousness of the matter, we were perplexed by her 'bedside' manner and wished that the situation had worked out differently."

Nice to have her at a new location too in which she seems to have more effective and helpful office staff as well as resources in general. I recommend her services to anyone, whether you fit the areas she specializes in, or even just general medical stuff. Sometimes she is on time, other times around 15 minutes behind.

As there are many treatments for Chronic Lyme and alot of controversy surrounding them, I don't always agree with Dr. Nelson. However I respect her and trust her information completely. When I am indecisive between a recommendation that conflicts with her beliefs I am apt to try her approach first. She also has Chronic Lyme herself so has personal experience along with clinical knowledge in fighting this disease."

Mostly allergy issues, but a few others too. I like that he doesn't push the meds unnecessarily, but he has an educated opinion as to the ""why"", and has had me on maintenance medications as needed. He has always been ready to send me to a specialist if need be. Personable family guy. He always answers my (many) questions with curiosity and good humor. I'm glad that the doctor's office, the Polyclinic, is finally 21st century with laptops and tablets to access your electronic health files and can easily schedule specialist visits at their various locations."

He has an excellent bedside manner and excellent staff (one person). My family's health ranges from special needs to healthy. He sees our newborns, foster children when we fostered, and my wife and I. He is very personable, provides explanations, advice, and opinions. He follows our health, follows up with hospitalizations, injuries, and procedures. From the other reviews it appears that he is not a doctor for those seeking prescriptions. This is true as he does not like to overmedicate (as modern as you can get) but will definitely prescribe you medication when necessary, as well as recommendations for PT and specialists for conditions or injuries. He provides checkups, vaccinations, minor in-office procedures, growth charts for our children, and will visit a hospital if needed. We've been through it all with him and I highly recommend him to anyone seeking a long-term family doctor. He cares."

When Dr. Peterson refused to consult a specialist for advice, I knew it was time to go elsewhere. I ended up having to travel 3000 miles to get a new prescription for a routine, life-sustaining medication."

Peterson,Seattle,Washington, Family Doctors / G.P.s , Male,6,4.38,2008-09-08T14:57:21Z,2.8,4,3,2,2,Didn't have much luck with this doctor as he seems to like to ascribe symptoms to idiopathic syndromes and is resistant to further investigation should the illness not be an easy diagnosis. He seems to want to treat symptoms only and not get to the root cause of illness. Seems to have a inordinate amount of belief in the placebo effect and won't continue medication even if you get better since he believes its due to the placebo effect and not the medication itself.

She doesn't make you feel rushed or stupid. She is intuitive, open to alternatives (like nutrition and supplements), and incredibly thorough.

She is sweet, kind, attentive, intuitive, and an excellent listener. She knows that you know what you are talking about because you are the patient. She's a wonderful partner in health care because she is open to your questions and suggestions, and is willing to let you take control of your own health care. She's also great at breaking down technical medical knowhow for the layman so you know exactly what is happening to you. She is the tops. Go to her!"

He took time to listen to me and was very patient in answering my questions. I appreciate that he explained his answers rather than just giving me ""yes"" or ""no's,"" the way so many doctors do. I was going to change to a practice located closer to my house, but am now reconsidering because I was so impressed with Dr S's bedside manner."

When it was required of him he referred me to other health care professionals who were outstanding as well. During the time that my family has used Dr. Mike as our physician he's done an outstanding job to make sure we are well cared for and seen as human beings and not just patient numbers. He's a caring, funny person and makes you feel at ease during all visits and I found his knowledge about alternative medicines to be very helpful and enlightening. My daughter loved him and never stressed about going to see him no matter what her visit involved as she trusted him. My husband who rarely ever goes to the doctor, willingly attended yearly exams after his first exam with Dr. Mike because of the competent care he received. That says a lot for Dr. Mike, believe me. Yes he's a busy guy but he makes you feel like the only patient he has when you see him."

We were happy with staff and the few interactions we had with Dr. R. Out of the blue we were told that we had to make Dr. R our primary care MD or get shots elsewhere. Not about to change my primary doc of a half dozen years, not to mention my sons pediatrician. Ok I can understand changing a policy, but we were not even allowed to get one more shot, requiring that I find an allergy doctor within 48 hours for my son and I to keep our shot schedule. Incredibly inconvenient for a busy parent and incredibly inconsiderate of Dr. R. Very disappointing."

Friendly staff, good service and accurate opinions. The visit can be fast, so I find it helpful to write things down I want to talk about before I get there.

Overall, very satisfied with Dr. Taki and would recommend him to anyone, especially if you are looking for a Doc who has an interest in working with you on sports related injuries and their prevention.

Looks like he really cares about you as a patient. Most importantly he gave me a proper diagnose and help me get better.

I highly, highly recommend Dr. Chandra."

Dr. Chandra always takes the time to involve me in my healthcare, and makes it a personal experience."

She is interested in a comprehensive approach to healing. Dr Chandra truly cares about her patients and explains any and all treatments to the lay person (not something every MD will do!!!). The latter probably accounts for the fact that she sometimes runs a few minutes behind, but in my mind it is a very small price to pay!"

She is very knowledgeable and will take time to explain every procedure and prescription and listen to you. It always seems like you're the only patient she has the whole day thru! Her medical assistants and lab staff are like rays of sunshine and always seem to be genuinely thrilled to have you at their clinic. Her reception desk staff though could have been nicer: I once called in to postpone an appointment and had the lady on the phone threaten to 'blacklist' me with other doctors if I did this again!! Well, I guess crabbity receptionists are a small price to pay to see this wonderful doctor!"

He's patient, he's thorough, and I trust the decisions he makes about my care.

This is despite the fact that she decided in the spring to charge a quarterly fee, which she called share care, just to even be a patient...even if you don't need her. With this new ""service"" she promised to be more reachable and available and promised appointments available five days a week. Not only is she still impossible to get ahold of but she is only open Mondays and Wednesdays this summer!!! First off, it seems wrong to even charge such a fee but to promise availability as well as ease of being able to communicate more quickly and easier is a farce.

She listens, she cares, she thouroughly explains things, she offers her full attention and allows for plenty of time to see her patients (in this case me), her office staff were friendly, and the actual office was calm and quiet. I normally go to N.D.'s, however, I was very impressed with her willingness to work with other 'types' of doctors and openness to my wanting to incorporate alternative medical practioners into my heath plan. I couldn't be happier and would gladly recommend her to my freinds and co-workers (which is how I came to know of her). I rate her high because too many times I have been to a doctor's office where everybody is in a huge hurry and I walked away feeling like nobody listened nor really cared about what is going on with my health. My symptoms weren't so obvious to most doctors and I was often dismissed. But again, Dr. Fiala not only listened with compassion but helped me get on the road to wonderful health!"

He is someone who is genuine and careing.I always looked forward to talking to him and getting his opinion. He always listened well, and respected my opinion too. One time he even called me at work to see how I was doing. I had to move, and really miss having him for my Dr. I only hope I can find one as good as him in my new city. It's important to be able to trust your Dr. and Dean is someone you can trust. I love that he leans toward holistic healing and in very smart about it. Yet he can prescribe western medicine as needed."

He's on top of what's new, but old school enough to understand the importance of bedside manner. He LISTENS to what you have to say about your body and what you think. He is thorough and works toward whole health rather than medicating for phantom issues like most doctors seem prone to doing these days."

He is such a great doctor and person that, in the past, I left an insurance company, because they didn't have him on their preferred list. He cares for his clients as if they're family. He's never steered me wrong and has even stood in the way, when another doctor has wanted to do a procedure that wasn't necessary. I would put Dr. Harris and Noble, his nurse, up against any team in the nation. No matter where I've lived in the Puget Sound, I have made the trip to keep him as my doctor. Once I was talking aobut my great doctor, to a friend. She said that she just loved her doctor, too. We found out that we both had Brad Harris!! Let his praises be sung!"

Giving the benefit of the doubt has been a theme with Dr Killian but one concern is his willingness to prescribe medication over exercising restraint and pause.

I've left his practice and have to say it's a refreshing change. My new doctor takes basic medical readings each visit (blood pressure, listens to chest, checks ears & temperature). She listens to my problems/issues without giving me some of her own. She is so thorough - which led me to realize just how unthorough Dr. Killian was. I'd keep looking if this is the doctor you are considering."

The doctor is also a treasure. I've been with him for over 4 years and he is knowledgeable, listens, and is just the right amount of touchy-feely. I've experienced no less than 3 very nasty doctors on the Eastside previously and knew it was conservative homophobia pure and simple. You won't get that here. For gay patients, you don't have to worry about some red state agenda with this guy. I had to move out of state and will miss him greatly."

I found him to be caring and helpful and up to date about possible treatments. When asked for explanations, he was patient and thorough about my options and even did further research after our appointment.

Did not appear to read the nurse's write-up so I had to refer him to information I provided a few minutes earlier. He asked an insulting question that had nothing to do with subject problem. Little eye contact. He instilled a very low level of confidence."

My wife doesn't feel listened to, and his answers aren't logical, but only meant to persuade/dissuade. If you have a concern, try someone else. We've taken our family to him for several years.

The same doctor is now tired, seemingly bored, almost arrogant, doesn't seem to listen, and utilizes the same time in a rush with little patient eye contact..hence listening. Is this considered burn out? Bored with the practice? Maybe personal problems are being brought to work? Not to mention the questionably high turn over rate with staff? Truly sad to witness the changes in a person that I once revered as incredible. Wishing for the old fresh and excited MD to come back!!!!"

They screen all calls but do not deliver messages accurately. He always seems in a hurry and usually only returns calls late in the day or the next day. This is not being very helpful. Knowledge-wise he is pretty good but he lets you know it and is far from humble...might I say a bit arrogant?

Dresang turned on us when we had a falling out with some friends of his. My husband was very sick and we were under enormous stress at the time.

I'll be 65 in November, and have had several medical problems in the last couple of years. He is so right on it's uncanny. I'm a diabetic 2, and he's been a good source of encouragement when I've ""been good"" about sticking to my diet. Also when I quit smoking you'd think it was Christmas for him, haha.

She also seems to recite the same monologue and or/dialogue every check up for our baby, this last one was nearly verbatim to the one prior (yes, I remembered it as soon as I heard it). It doesn't necessarily seem as though she is in a hurry, but she doesn't personalize our experience at all, and is out of the exam room in 10 minutes or less. I feel like she finally remembers our faces, after a year, but no details about our child's development. She has even forgotten how old our kid was, more than once. She also gives very generic advice, without taking into consideration our stand point or parenting style (which she likely has no clue about, since she doesn't really engage us in conversation about it). Generic advice is fine, I guess, but it does make it seem like she thinks there is just one way to do things, which isn't great. She is undoubtedly knowledgeable in her field, but not the right fit for us. "

The other staff however lacks severely. From the front desk to the lab and the nurses, they are rude, impatient, and seem to hate their professions. I have been a patient for over a year and I have seen several staffing changes, yet the outcome is all too familiar. Scheduling is difficult, and the staff seems put off by questions especially billing concerns.
I do not like having to deal with the negative interactions from ALL the other staff, but I love having Dr. Hatfield as my primary care physician."

If you challenge his recommendations respectfully, he will listen carefully. I never felt that he rushed through my visits."

He is too busy and can sometimes take days to get an appointment. His new nurse great. He gives me prescriptions and said if it were me I would just wait it out. He let my father go 10 years after seeing a specialist to diagnose him with heart disease. He had seen a specialist 10 years previous that stated it was heart disease and Dr. Clemens did not take him seriously which could have prevented a heat attack. Dr. Clemens always rushes in and out of the office and does not take time to listen.

Saw her for my 17 yr old for a first time visit and a Celiac panel.

She helped us cover all our bases with referrals and blood work too. We were both very pleased with her.

He is medically very knowledgeable, knows your family, and really seems to care. We have called in the afternoon with health concerns about our children and he has met us at his office after hours to fit them in. He never seems rushed when seeing you, which leads into my one complaint. Unless you have the first appointment of the day, he is always behind schedule. I know this is because he spends time with his patients, but it is still annoying to have to wait anywhere from 10-30 minutes for him to come in. Other then that, he is a great doctor."

While I was in the room waiting for her she was discussing my condition outside with the medical assistant. Since I heard clearly was she was saying I know that other patients heard her as well. When she came in the room, I let her know and she told me that I was lying. So she proceeded and started taking my medical history in a very condescending way. I told her that I developed a liver complication during pregnancy. She told me that it was probably due to my drugs or alcohol usage. I hardly drink and I have never used drugs but she did not believe me. At that point I got up I left. Now, I have a great Ob/gyn doctor."

He answers questions with ease and has a warm, caring manner. He is so sensitve that when he does pap smears, he doesn't put his patients in the position of asking for a woman to be present--he simply has his nurse come in and explains what the procedure will be like.

I doubted some of the advice he gave me on some asthma-related treatment, went through some very expensive rounds of tests and different treatments by two different specialists, and ended up right back at what Dr. Moscovitz had told me in the beginning. Depending on the day he's not always the most friendly/outgoing/sociable person, and occasionally in a hurry, and once he forgot that we had found a certain antibiotic was not effective and I had to remind him of that. But when I prepare before my appointment, know my issues, my questions, and what I need, he has listened carefully, interacted intelligently, and taken care of my issues to my satisfaction.

Myint,Seattle,Washington, Family Doctors / G.P.s , Female,6,3.4,2012-07-25T16:32:37Z,4.5,4,4,5,5,One of the things that I find special about Dr. Myint is that she isn't afraid to tell you that she doesn't know something. She will recommend you to someone who is an expert and continues to follow up on your case. I know thats her job but It is rare to find a doctor whose ego will allow him/her to admit they don't know everything. It makes me feel much more comfortable with her than I do with most doctors.

Sometimes a little too quick for my liking, but she's never left me hanging. I've never left an appointment with her feeling like my problem wasn't recognized. I've been her patient for 6 years now, and remain very loyal to her. **Important to note!!** she cannot help you if she doesn't have all the details. If you hold something back, you might leave the appointment not satisfied. I think she is the only one on the face of earth that knows every detail about me and still likes me anyway!"

He spends the time he needs to with you and gives ideas in all areas, of things that might help. I also send my grown son to him because he needed a doctor. He spend an HOUR with him! My son said, ""Never has a doctor spent that much time with me!"" I highly recommend this doctor. (but I don't want him to get so popular that it's hard to get an appointment :) )"

This Dr was rude and actually told me to ""Hurry Up"". I had an itching rash. He did not even suggest an ointment! Would not really discuss second reason for appointment (possible bad hip bone). Never - ever will I see him again! If I want to be treated rudely and my have my information ignored, I can talk to my family!"

When I looked at my recent records I realized she had not heard anything I said! She put notes in my file bc she obviously wasn't listening. She is snippy and very cross. Doesn't seem to care at all about the patient. Constantly referring me out to other docs. I Always feel rushed in her appointments. I tried staying with her for years and NOW I am going to find another doctor who shows compassion and know how to accurately document medical records. Not a fan of Swedish either bc of her and another specialist I saw in orthopedics. That organization needs to do a better job in helping doctors communicate Accurate information between each other regarding their patients. My most recent experiences have caused more stress than good. I DO NOT recommend Dr. Okorn to anyone.

Instead of research my symptoms, she told me to go back on a medication that was making it just bareable to get out of bed, rather than searching for the source of my misery.

She does take time to listen and is knowledgeable and has helped me many times over the years. She helped diagnose my rheumatoid arthritis very early so I could get the best possible care.

I had a high-risk pregnancy and didn't even know it. My medical records show that 2 ultrasounds, done at 20 and 25 weeks could not find a portion of my son's heart. Neither the radiologists at Swedish Ballard Hospital nor Dr. Bautista called for further testing. After 28 hours of induced labor my son was born via c-section with a heart defect. Everyone in the operating room was scrambling to figure out why he turned blue 3 minutes after birth. My son wasn't intubated until 23 minutes after birth, and even then it took longer to get the right oxygen levels. At 9 days old my son had open-heart surgery to fix the heart defect. At 1 year old he had his first seizure and wasn't holding his head up on his own so his pediatrician scheduled an MRI. The MRI showed that our son has cerebral palsy. I believe the cerebral palsy could have been prevented if the birthing team had been prepared for a high-risk pregnancy. Our s"

When I discovered I was pregnant, the nurse with whom I was working suggested Dr. Femiano, who was looking for pre-natal patients. Once I met him, I immediately trusted him and felt comfortable speaking honestly with him (which I rarely feel with doctors, who tend to seem judgmental). He treated me throughout my pregnancy, which was not your run of the mill pregnancy as I am considered ""Advanced Maternal Age"" and developed gestational diabetes. He helped me manage my diabetes with diet and exercise, and was always very helpful with his explanations (and I tend to ask a lot of questions). The birth was a very positive experience, and his support definitely is one of the reasons it was so positive. I have decided to stay with him as my physician/my daughter's pediatrician (he is a family practice doctor). He is kind, thoughtful, knowledgeable, and capable, and I highly recommend him."

She always takes her time to make sure that you understand everything, and she never makes you feel uncomfortable asking even your most embarrassing questions. She is always on time and always pleasant. I spent years being bounced from doctor to doctor trying to figure out what was going on, but I felt like no one ever really listened. Dr. Smith listened and believed me, and after many meetings with neurosurgeons and specialists and a big surgery, I can confidently say that Dr. Smith saved my life. Between her knowledge, her kindness, and her ability to connect, she is by far the most beautiful person I have ever known. I get to watch my kids grow up thanks to her, I get to see them go to school, have their first crush, play sports, go to prom, graduate, and eventually have families of their own.

The medication she recommended to me gave me hives and made me gain 20 lbs. I told her about it later and asked if there was anything that I could do. She told me that it is not related (however, the disclaimed side effects state otherwise). I know my body better than anyone else, and I felt like I wasn't being heard. I would chalk it up to a bad experience but like I said, I have left with the same feeling the last few times."

She knows us all well, remembers questions we asked 3 appointments ago (or she just that she takes great notes) and is generally everything you could hope for in a family doctor/GP. I always seem to be in a hurry and I love that she's thorough but terse so I can get back to work. Crack a joke about one of my family members (they're all characters and the jokes are deserved :), ask how I'm feeling, do the normal appointment things, take care and we're done. Brown's familiar with everything from heart disease to women's health to the more modern issues of IBS and eating disorders. Only downside is she's only in the office 3 days a week (last I checked) so sometimes you have to take appointments with the other doctors in the practice, who are also great, but not Doc Brown. I'd whole-heartedly recommend her as a doctor for any family!"

For more than a year I have experience textbook symptoms of hypothyroidism. She has refused to adequately diagnose or treat this in any way, despite test results showing an elevated TSH level. She has additionally misdiagnosed gastrointestinal symptoms, resulting in an unnecessary, prohibitive Low FODMAPs diet. Her medical approach seems to be ""throw 4 different things at the problem and see what sticks."" I am switching to a doctor that will treat me for the disease I actually have. No more fighting to get appropriate care."

She was incapable of rendering a proper diagnosis of hypothyroid in spite of me telling her my litany of symptoms and telling her of an extensive family history of thyroid problems, including my mother and sister. My case was a total no brainer. Instead of ordering the labs to find out if I was right, she insisted on arguing with me, telling me that I was just depressed, and that at the ripe old age of 34 my symptoms were the normal aging process (hair falling out, major weight loss in spite of eating like crazy, jitters, anxiety, sleeplessness, nails with ridges, freezing cold all the time, mental fog, forgetfulness). She kept insisting on prescribing Prozac. When I asked her if Prozac would relieve my symptoms she said no. Then what's the point?

If you are un-insured they charge a flat rate for a visit. Sounds like a good deal... He is VERY proud of how ""cheap"" he is and the long hours he works. However, when his treatment doesn't work or you leave messages to follow up you get absolutely no reply. I'd stop being so proud of the long hours since it apparently means there is no time to follow up after the exchange of money. Patronizing ineffective mostly useless MD, apparently feels if you constantly repeat that you are a good doctor who works long hours and charges less than that other guy it makes up for a complete lack of follow through and a bad attitude. His staff however attempt to be helpful, you can tell they also think he is mostly ineffective and frustrating with their sympathetic ""believe me i know how you feel"" looks. He also grossly underestimates lab work. Quote was 100-200...he swears they told him 130... Reality is over 400. RUN."

Our lives have been miserable, and the baby is in agony. This man should think twice about practicing medicine."

I had a very bad accident and my knee was serverely injured and she truly could not have evinced more disinterest or lack of curiosity as to figuring out what happened to my knee. She did try an xray and told me to take Advil (duh!) I just got a totally lame blowoff letter in the mail saying in its entirety: ""The xray did not reveral any fractures. The radiologist did not mild arthritis."" No next steps, no nothing. Hello. I had a trauma to my knee on a specific date 12 days ago. Before this my knee worked fine. Now it doesn't work. I don't think that has anything to do with pre existing arthritis. My nose got fractured and I got 12 stitches in my forehead so presumably, something bad happened to my KNEE that day too.

She stated she would not prescribe the medications I have been taking for over a year it was ""not in the practice of the clinic."" but she did not fully inform me of this. If she had I would have left and established care somewhere else. She criticized my profession and doubted my own judgment of MY symptoms. There has been no follow up other than the numerous refers she could make for me. I made it clear that I did not have the resources to seek out many other specialists. So, now I am out of the money and time and have nothing to show for my effort. She also would not return my call with test result that the administrative staff said were fully available. I had to wait over a week after finding out that the test results were actually ready. Overall, I would rather have not gone at all."

Her nurse criticized me for not going to my normal PCP (who was out of town...) and Dr Chao took one look at my terrible insurance and sent me out the door with absolutely no help. Completely impersonal, never acted like she cared or wanted to be there, didn't give any indication she ever wanted to see me again. She spent half of the 5-10 minute exam with her hand on the door ready to leave as I tried to ask her questions. Never will go back and even thinking about calling up UWMC administration due to how bad the whole experience was. Definitely not recommended."

Dr. Griffiths is family physician, and I had asked to schedule an appointment with an internist. None of the staff, including the medical assistant who took my history IN THE EXAM ROOM, could confirm whether or not Dr. Griffiths was an internist. In fact, it was only when I had met her and read her name tag, that it was confirmed that she is indeed NOT an internist. Her knowledge is limited and when informed of an ailment and directly asked a question regarding the associated anatomy, she was unfamiliar with the (very basic) anatomy I was referring to. Then proceeded to order an expensive diagnostic test for this problem, without examining the affected area. This lead to advanced imaging which missed the affected area. Had she been familiar with the anatomy and actually laid hand on the affected area, perhaps the affected area would have been imaged. I do not recommend Dr. Griffiths or Sandpoint Internists clinic."

I had been going to the Swedish Downtown practice for many years and had always had wonderful experiences...until I had an appointment with Dr. Etzkorn. He is dismissive, rude and simply put, awful at his job. Why in the world would you chose family practice medicine when you seem to clearly hate people? Maybe go back to medical school and study anesthesiology or something where you only interact with inanimate objects? "

Types on computer without looking at you for 90% of appointment. Looked at my throat as part of the general exam and told me my tonsils looked fine. I had to inform him I didn't have tonsils. Lost all confidence in his diagnosing at that point. Left appointment in tears frustrated with his condescending manner"

She is easy to talk to and kind. She is interested in alternative medicine (and is also great for non-clinical things like vitamins, blood sugar, exercise, etc), but doesn't insist if you're not interested in alternative medicine (I'm not). She is sensitive to one's financial situation and explains how much each test costs, and explores alternatives if you cannot afford it right then. The best thing about Dr Gardey (to me) is her willingness to go and read up on whatever your problem is. She can offer new solutions from recent research if you're not responding to treatment, and she has been very competent at researching and ongoing care of some unusual conditions. She is happy to give the patient copies of the articles and works hard to make sure you understand everything. The billing and scheduling staff can be very disorganized, though."

Joseph Badolato didn't come into work the rest of the week. If it wasn't for my husband and myself raising hell with his medical assistants, they would of let my husband sit over the weekend with a broken foot!!!! He had BROKE 4 bones in his foot and ended up having surgery that Friday. Dr. Badolato's MA calls 2 wks later asking if we got in to see the Podiatrist (the foot surgeon).

I also had my mother go to her as she moved to Wa with me. My mom went to her for a new patient exam and to refill medication that was low since moving here. My mother was basically denied medication refill of her blood pressure medication unless a full physical including rectal and gynecological exam were performed in office. Um. No. My mother has other doctors that perform those procedures. My mother then said she was low and the doctor told her she would prescribe her a limited amount but had to come back for the full exams in order to receive a blood pressure medication refill. So now I feel like my mothers health was being held hostage for a copay/ unnecessary rectal/gynecological exam. I am trying to find a new doctor for my mother as I'm writing this. I hope I can find one with an open appointment soon or my mom will be out necessary medication for at least a month. I cannot believe a doctor would deny someone a refill on their blood pressure medication just because they didn't want a whole work up done. Especially in her decrepit office. This doctor does not abide by ""above all else do no harm"""

Griffin,Seattle,Washington, Family Doctors / G.P.s , Female,2,3,2008-09-17T21:19:09Z,3.3,4,3,3,3,"Dr. Griffin's staff members are polite and thoroughly research insurance policies before confirming an appointment. Dr. Griffin, on the other hand, was less impressive. The notes she took during the appointment were on a blank piece of paper, not part of a regular medical file. I came to her office to receive a vaccine, but none of the side effects were discussed. She just turned me over to her assistant and left the room. I received a leaflet of the side effects, but the leaflet detailed only a small fraction of the total known side effects for the vaccine. Dr. Griffin was not in good physical condition herself, which always makes me question the healthy integrity of any health professional."

She does not review patient history before the appointment, which after hounding me to come in for my physical, she should have been more prepared. I have many surgery scars, and it's all in my record, she shouldn't have to say ""Oh, what's this?"" and when a patient comes in with a sprain, shouldn't she touch that body part at least once? She is very dismissive and does not respect that her patients have researched and understand their own bloodwork. She made me feel like a small child, rather than a mature adult. Not going back to her again."

Pemberton,Seattle,Washington, Family Doctors / G.P.s , Female,3,2.58,2017-02-03T21:43:12.878Z,4.8,5,4,5,5,"Dr Pemberton has been my GP for around 5-6 years, and she has literally helped me as I battle multiple health issues. She's always receptive to my needs, and incredibly knowledgable! Not to mention kind. I honestly do not know what I would do with out her. She's quick to help me get referrals for specialists, and genuinely cares about me, and my health. Sometimes the office has her running late, but that's because she wants to give all of her patients the time they need to address their health concerns. Her staff has been punctual, and kind, and the office is relaxing. I question those other two comments, and I think if we're going to review other people online, let's at least give our names. I'm Jess Oldwyn, and I adore my GP Dr Pemberton. If people can't see her kindness, dedication, intelligence, then maybe it could also be something going on in their own life that makes them so angry to post mean comments. I'm sorry that they had a poor experience, but maybe Dr Pemberton is better off working with patients that can give a little grace and understanding too. I am not over exaggerating that she continues to help me navigate all of my various doctors, and the nuances of my (almost) 7 year cancer battle. Don't let those reviews sway you. What you put into your own care with Dr Pemberton, will be returned 10 fold. I think she's one of the best doctors I have ever had the pleasure of working with, and I'm sure you can imagine, I've worked with a lot."

Her staff is clumsy, unkowledgeable, and seems uncomfortable - which makes you feel very uneasy when you are seeking medical advice and attention. I came to discuss an issue and she didn't even consider running a very common test (for the issue I actually had), until I had to return to her office and follow up with a call specifically asking for the test. I do not recommend her as a doctor and question her overall competency. "

I came in for a specific issue and she wanted to discuss anything but the issue. I had to bring it up around 8 times before she cursorily addressed it. She had me take a large number of blood tests, which turned out to have nothing to do with the issue. She shared one test result with me but not the other 12 tests. Her staff was rude and I had to explain my question 8 times before I could get a reasonable answer. After all the tests, I still had not had my primary concern addressed and no indication that Dr. Pemberton was willing to address it. It was very difficult to get appointments in a timely manner. The reception area's computers always seem to be down and they don't call back when they say they will. Most times appointments are multiple weeks out, even for urgent issues. I am not returning to this office."

She is also nearly impossible to get in to see now that she is working 3 days a week.

My regular doc wasn't available so I saw Dr. Adams. After explaining my problems with a very serious sinus infection last year, I asked for antibiotics. After trying to prescribe me a garlic/ginger tea, she agreed to prescribe antibiotics. I took them for 7 days, with no improvement then immediately got worse as soon as the prescription ran out. I returned and was able to see my regular doc who explained that Adams had given me a ""naturopathic dose"" of antibiotics that effectively did nothing. It is now two weeks later, I am much worse (though the REAL antibiotics I received last week have helped). Given that I went in specifically asking for antibiotics and she gave me a dose not powerful enough for an infant, I think this is not only bad medicine, but bad boundaries. I would not still be sick if I had informed consent about the dosage. unacceptable."

I have seen this Dr at the 45th Clinic in Seattle for many months trying to explain to her how much pain I am in on a daily basis. She refuses to write me a script for more than 2 vicodin a day, allowing my just 60 for 30 days. I called in a refill for my script and when I went to pick it up today they told me I couldn't have it until the 15th of March. Last time it was refilled was 2-11-09, even with only 28 days in Feb that would make 30 days fall on the 12th not the 15th. So she wants to see me in pain for 3 days. Her solution is to write me a script for Tramadol which I informed her was not to be taken with two of my other meds as it could make me very sick and send me to the hospital or cause a seizure, she didn't bother to check the PDR. I called after hours at home to try to get my script released she hung up on me. I don't hang up on my clients even on weekends."

He requires patients to schedule an expensive office visit just to refill a prescription. He only works 3 days a week so trying to get an appointment for a real health purpose is almost impossible. He is a poor listener and doesn’t answer questions since he believes his patients are ignorant of their own health. This guy should be avoided like the plague. I wouldn’t let him treat my dog."

Given my lifestyle, I couldn't understand how I'd contracted it. The staff told me in the outside area where everyone could hear, with disrespect in their voices, that I certainly had it when I voiced doubt. I lived with the shame and confusion for all these years. I foolishly didn't ask another doctor for all these years. I finally did and discovered that I definitely do not have any disease. I feel absurd telling all this to a doctor I haven't seen in so many years but, please be warned. I don't know if the same staff is working with Dr. Gromko but consider checking information and double-checking that information. This wasn't their only error but this was the worst.

On the last visit, I felt like she was a totally different person - she rushed me through the exam, basically said we can only focus on one thing for this session (despite that I had a number of issues to tackle) and really felt like I was not listened to.

She was often late with getting me needed Rx's. Personally I found Dr K to be a nice young woman and easy to talk to before that last visit. Someone in fam practice doesn't expect to get a complicated disease as a case.. I understand that, but she promised to fight for me and broke that promise."

Unfortunately it appears this is no longer the case. She's not focused on my healthcare anymore and has failed me as a doctor. I would have never imagined I'd write a review and warn others, but here I am. Something went very wrong with that little doctor's office. Perhaps it was due to the changes in Swedish Medical policies, the hospital's absorption of the practice, or that she's simply no longer invested in her work. She she seems distracted and rushed during appointments and fails to hear what I try and share with her. She referred me to another doctor who laughed out loud when I shared what Dr.Leigh had told me as a patient. She's lost my trust. How sad to say that I have lost faith in my doctor and she has in turn lost a patient. The quaint little Swedish Ballard physicians office I used know and love is gone forever.

But as soon as I revealed a family history of depression and anxiety, Everytime I see her now, she refused to listen to me and insists I be medicated (despite a Psychologists opinion).

And for both cases, it turned out that he put wrong dose numbers on the prescription. One is my own case. And a friend told me she had same experience.

His questions were vague and confusing. When I tried to answer them he would rudely interrupt me. I don't think I got many full sentences out without rude interruptions.
At one point he tried to use my words against me and said that I said things I had never said. He definitely had not listened well to what I had been saying before rudely interrupting me.
When he gave me a diagnosis, he just sat staring at me with a strange smirk, not proceedong with any information about a treatment plan. After waiting a few moments, I politely asked how we would treat it. No response, just the same stare and weird smirk. After waiting a few more moments, I politely and calmly asked again, to which he accused me of challenging him! I haven't a clue what I was supposedly challenging him about...unless a patient asking for a treatment plan is an unacceptable challenge for a doctor!
I still don't have a good odea of what his treatment plan is.
When it became clear to him that I would not be making a follow-up appointment, he claimed I was doing myself a disservice because no one else is providing the services that could help me. The biggest disservice I think I could do to myself is to see this doctor again."

Unfortunately it appears this is no longer the case. She's not focused on my healthcare anymore and has failed me as a doctor. I would have never imagined I'd write a review and warn others, but here I am. Something went very wrong with that little doctor's office. Perhaps it was due to the changes in Swedish Medical policies, the hospital's absorption of the practice, or that she's simply no longer invested in her work. She she seems distracted and rushed during appointments and fails to hear what I try and share with her. She referred me to another doctor who laughed out loud when I shared what Dr.Leigh had told me as a patient. She's lost my trust. How sad to say that I have lost faith in my doctor and she has in turn lost a patient. The quaint little Swedish Ballard physicians office I used know and love is gone forever.

After a cholesteral test, she said it was normal and my symptoms must be something else. I paid out of pocket and went to a cardiologist, since I KNEW something was very wrong, and the day after seeing the cardiologist I was in the hospital having open heart surgery. My wife noticed a pattern with Giedt long before my experience; Giedt hides behind test results and ignores the presenting patient sitting right in front of her. Wife also noticed that if she presented with symptoms that could use more thorough testing, Giedt seemed to become confused and shut down, ultimately doing nothing. If all you need is vaccinations or your sore throat looked at, she's probably fine; but if you have a more complicated condition you may be better off finding someone else. My experience was a few years ago, and we have a new PCP now. If I had stayed with Giedt I would be dead now. But my cholesteral would be fine."

From a far from friendly receptionist, to a inexperienced dental assistant, and Dr. Lee, although very friendly, let me walk out the door knowing that he had botched my crown. He told me that to make it fit properly he had to grind the crown very thin but it should be O.K. Well it was not. I could feel with my tongue that there was a whole at the base of the crown. When my normal dentist inspected it, he wanted to replace it, stating that food will lodge in the hole and sooner or later I will have to have a root canal because of it. He was dumbfounded that Dr. Lee let me walk out the door with such an improper fit. The options for preferred providers in Bellingham is a joke, but if you have to use one, I recommend you try one of the other jokers."

She included some private information about other patients at which point I interjected and told her that I did not want that information disclosed to me. An argument ensued. Naked from the waist down, wrapped only in a sheet, my legs numb from Demerol, she said that she would not perform the procedure on me, that my procedure was not very important, and demanded that I get out. I tried to get away from her into the safety of a bathroom where I could lock the door, get dressed, and leave. While in the hallway, visible to her staff, Dr. Eileen Gibbons proceeded to yell at me that I was stealing her sheet and she was going to call the police.

Dr. Koller had me begin seeing her weekly uder the guise of talking about how to better handle sleep and pain. When the 'sessions' turned into something else, I immediately left her practice. Upon my leaving, Dr. Koller admitted to me that she had decided to do therapy with me until I ""trusted"" someone else and then she intended to ""hand me over to a trained therapist.""

507,Dr. James Squire,Seattle,Washington, Family Doctors / G.P.s , Male,1,1,2017-07-22T02:43:39.722Z,1,1,1,1,1,"Dr. Squire broke the hippocratic oath; ""Do Know Harm"". He's not my doctor, but was the doctor my family member, and his treatment of this patient was unfounded, unethical, and absolutely unprofessional. I've been in the medical field for ten years, so I can assure you from a medical standpoint, he left a patient in harms way. I am also a chronic pain patient who is managed by an exceptional pain management doctor and also on suboxone for pain control. So I understand the medication, the contracts that need to be signed between patient and caregiver and everything that goes along with being a Suboxone patient. Unfortunately, Dr. Deal retired, whom my Family member did great with for years. His initial visit with Squire was unfortunately during a relapse. Relapse happens with addiction, it happens all the time and if you're an addiction doctor you better realize this and the last thing you should do is leave your patient high and dry with no other options but to go out on the street and shoot heroin risking their life because the alternative of withdrawing from Suboxone is far too painful and requires medical care that most people can't afford . Squire played Russian roulette with somebody in my family and left him in this situation and I will make sure that I post a review everywhere I can post a review that so that nobody else entrusts their family members, whom they love and adore into this man's incapable hands. He prescribed two weeks of buponophrine, a medication you cannot go without. They had a follow up visit scheduled after the two week supply, but unfortunately my family member was having serious health issues involving his ankle that has still been undiagnosed. I have been to multiple doctor appointments with multiple specialties and nobody can figure out what's going on. The reason he missed his appointment with Dr. Squire was because I had to take him to the emergency room because he was limping, swollen and in tears. He phoned Dr. Squire as soon as he could to update him on the situation and all of this is documented in his medical record. There are no secrets. There's no drug seeking. There is an undiagnosed very painful health issue going on that is causing all this distress . But Dr. Squire assumed the role of a psychiatrist and determined that this patient was having a mental health crisis or was in full-blown relapse without having a single indication of that. His recommendation was that he needed to go to Harborview for an a evaluation as he could not treat him and refused to schedule a follow up, mind you this was all done via text despite me encouraging my loved one to beg Squire for a phone call and Squire out right refused. How can one go to Harborview to be evaluated for a relapse when you're not on any drugs or having a mental break down? What kind of quality Dr. engages in a texting communication when the level of urgency is this severe? I am absolutely astonished and blown away and I've never witnessed such poor judgment my entire 10 years in the medical field . He had one appointment with this patient and this patient was still under his care. He doesn't know this patient. This patient has been having health issues unrelated to addiction and therefore missed an appointment with Squire. Per squires signed contract if Squier fires you he will supply you with one week of Suboxone to taper off but he wormed his way out of this by referring this patient to Harborview when it was completely inappropriate for him to go there. For those of you that don't know, stopping suboxone suddenly is more painful than quitting heroin. Dr. Squire couldn't take the time out of his precious day to actually call this patient and and have a conversation and see for himself he was not crazy or high. He also offered that he could call his PCP to further discuss and verify what was going on. Treating addiction is a specialty, a talent, and requires the most compassion and care for the patient. Dr. Squire possesses none of these qualities. Accusing a patient of having some sort of mental breakdown when the patient very clearly is not, but rather trying to reach out to him to reschedule his appointment so he can be on his maintenance dose medication, Dr. Squire absolutely did Harm and broke the Hippocratic oath. I would not trust Dr. Squire for general medicine or addiction medicine or any other medicine whatsoever. If you want to go and do addiction medicine then you better realize and understand that your patients are going to relapse and that your patients need you and you have to be there as their support system or as part of their support system and when somebody is in dire straits and you're their doctor, you don't turn your back.

Rolled her eyes in front of me and was very brief and cold. Thank goodness she is not ""my doc!"" In fact, I changed my insurance from Group Health because of the experience.
