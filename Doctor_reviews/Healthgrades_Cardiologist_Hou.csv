It was 2.5 hours before he found time to get to me. I laid on the gurney in the procedure room for about an hour while the staff and I waited for Dr Bala to get off the phone. If it hadn't taken 2 days of prep, I would have run out of there!  I told the Anesthesiologist I wanted a new doctor.  Dr. Bala came rushing in!!  When the Anesthesiologist (William CRNA) injected the lidocaine, I yelled it hurt so bad, but none of them cared!  Then he injected the anesthesia and I started crying, but he still didn't care!  William CRNA blew out the vein so the solution was being injected under my skin.  My entire hand is still black and blue.  They just wanted me to shut up and get out of there. What happened to the Hippocratic Oath, “first, do no harm”?  Even after I woke up from anesthesia, the staff didn't even make sure I got to my vehicle.  Thanks for reminding me why I fear the medical community.	4	16 – 30 minutes	TX	1	2.9	3
353	Apr 20, 2019	3	Internal Medicine	Dr. Natarajan Bala	Houston,	12	4	Excellent doctor! I've had other Gastroenterologists but Dr. Bala is the absolute best! I had a procedure done and not only did he provide me info to read about my condition, he spent an extraordinary length of time explaining my condition and his plan of action. He will be my doctor for LIFE!	4	16 – 30 minutes	TX	5	2.9	3
354	Jan 02, 2018	3	Internal Medicine	Dr. Natarajan Bala	Houston,	12	4	After Dr. Bala scheduled and performed a successful colonoscopy on my sister in March of 2017, I had him do an EGD and colonoscopy on me in July of 2017. Once again, both he and the staff at Memorial Herman Bay Area Endoscopy Center were professional, knowledgeable, and friendly. The procedure was successful, and everything only took about three hours. Afterward, he explained the results to me and my wife and gave us pictures of the procedure and a printout of the results to take home.	4	16 – 30 minutes	TX	5	2.9	3
355	Aug 17, 2016	3	Internal Medicine	Dr. Natarajan Bala	Houston,	12	4	I had a delay prior to the start of my procedure, I had few questions for the provider as I am in the medical profession myself.  Would recommend to a friend/family member.	4	16 – 30 minutes	TX	4	2.9	3

357	Feb 08, 2016	3	Internal Medicine	Dr. Natarajan Bala	Houston,	12	4	Quality of doctor is straightforward and to the point.  I did change from another doctor I had seen in the area, because, even with an appointment, I would have to wait hours, literally, to see him and then had very little face time to ask questions.	4	16 – 30 minutes	TX	4	2.9	3
358	May 14, 2019	4	Gastroenterology	Dr. Kalyanam Subramanyam	Webster,	9	4	I have been using Dr. K Subramanyam for at least 25 years.  I have seen him for little things and for major surgeries.  I have never known him to be rude or not to answer my questions.  I just hope that I no longer need his services before he retires.  Wonderful doctor!	3	16 – 30 minutes	TX	5	3.7	4
359	Oct 20, 2018	4	Gastroenterology	Dr. Kalyanam Subramanyam	Webster,	9	4	Staff is incompetent. Took almost 3 months to get approval for a medication. They left a message that it had been called in to my pharmacy but they failed to do so. Called his office to enquire and was treated rudely. Told the third person I spoke with if the medication isn’t called in by tonight to cancel my next appointment. 	3	16 – 30 minutes	TX	1	3.7	4

361	Mar 22, 2017	4	Gastroenterology	Dr. Kalyanam Subramanyam	Webster,	9	4	Awful. Never answers questions. Long wait lines. Gives little info about medical condition and procedures. Staff is rude and unprofessional. Just out to make money. 	3	16 – 30 minutes	TX	1	3.7	4
