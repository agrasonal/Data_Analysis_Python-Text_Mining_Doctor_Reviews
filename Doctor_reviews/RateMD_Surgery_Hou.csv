I wish he was my primary care doctor, not just a surgeon I saw for a quick procedure. He is very kind, funny and attentive to questions and concerns. If I ever need a surgeon in future, I will request him.	"

Lainez,Houston,Texas,General Surgeon, Male,60,4.99,2018-12-10T11:32:44.161Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Reading the online reviews for Dr. Lainez was the major contributor to why I selected him for my bariatric surgery consultation. The reviews rang true -- he was friendly and compassionate and seemed to genuinely care about my health and my reasons for considering surgery. Should I move forward, I look forward to him being my surgeon."
7,Dr. Romeo A. Lainez,Houston,Texas,General Surgeon, Male,60,4.99,2018-12-03T10:13:23.495Z,5,5,5,5,5,I'm very happy to have meet Dr. Laniez very caring person I was really worried about going thought the process of it all but he always assured me all will be fine i thank him from the bottom of my heart I will forever be grateful he gave me more time to be with my kids instead of being in hospital with pain. Thank you very much!
8,Dr. Romeo A. Lainez,Houston,Texas,General Surgeon, Male,60,4.99,2018-11-29T07:47:01.241Z,5,5,5,5,5,It is always a pleasant experience. I happened to be running late that day and they were so accommodating and understanding. I am always concerned about being on time. The entire staff is always pleasant and up beat! Always a great visit! Thank you staff for making my visit great!
9,Dr. Romeo A. Lainez,Houston,Texas,General Surgeon, Male,60,4.99,2018-11-20T09:31:37.917Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Lainez operated on our 16 year old son. Our son had never had surgery before and my husband and I were extremely nervous/anxious. Dr. Lainez explained the whole procedure to us. His bedside manner was amazing. He was kind and was very sympathetic in addressing our fears. The operation was successful. My son's wound is healing just as it should. After surgery, my son only took one pain pill. I believe that was due to Dr. Lainez's excellent surgery and also the fact that he spoke to my teenaged son directly about what to do and not do as far as post-surgery care. I highly recommend Dr. Lainez - a great surgeon and a great person!"
10,Dr. Thomas R. Newton,Houston,Texas,General Surgeon, Male,11,4.98,2014-11-19T16:19:15.734Z,4.8,4,5,5,5,"Difficult not to rate this Doc a 5-star, but his Assistant (Whom I call Renfield, an Aggie, of all things!) can be troublesome. Assistant is almost gone, so all will be well shortly. Dr. Newton handled my case from Emergency, through disconnect and now through reconnect. He has been kind, knowledgeable, willing to share knowledge, and in my case, very patient, and I have pushed him to find out what kind of man he is. Always best to know before he cuts into your belly (again). I have the addition of a compromised immune system (Lyme Disease) and unfortunately, I think he asked the wrong colleagues about it, and was given the standard BS. It's okay, I hope he never finds out about it, personally. Dr. Newton is top notch & I have no problem recommending him to anyone for the type of procedure(s) in which he specializes. He's done an excellent job.
P.S. - The 4 stars regarding his staff is because one of his nurses was quite rude to me on the phone after my 1st OV. That's okay, it's not the first time, nor the last time I make someone on a Dr.'s staff angry at me."
11,Dr. Thomas R. Newton,Houston,Texas,General Surgeon, Male,11,4.98,2013-07-10T21:22:58Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Newton performed my husbands reversal of his ileostomy. Our original surgeon wanted to perform this reversal after him being out of the hospital for 3 weeks (he was in the hospital 54 days). Dr. Newton performed the surgery 4 months later and did a wonderful job. had I gone with the original surgeon I would not be writing this. He explained everything to us and left nothing on the table. He was suppose to be on vacation and he showed up in our room early on a Saturday morning to check on my husband. If you ever need a great colon doctor, look no further."
12,Dr. Thomas R. Newton,Houston,Texas,General Surgeon, Male,11,4.98,2013-04-15T10:08:03Z,5,5,5,5,5,Dr Newton is the best there is. He is so patient and kind and takes the time to explain things to you in a way you can understand not using dr language. After being diagnosed with colon cancer and deciding surgery was needed he came in on his day off to explain to my family what was going to happen. He genuinely cares for his patients and no question was to small or to minor. He was such a God send during this terrifying experience. Dr. Newton is the best there is according to the nurses at the hospital. He even came in during a hurricane to check on his patients. He is an amazing dr and better yet an amazing person who wants only the best for his patients and makes sure that that is what they receive. I will tell anyone who will listen to go to him because he is the best.
13,Dr. Thomas R. Newton,Houston,Texas,General Surgeon, Male,11,4.98,2012-09-14T10:57:49Z,5,5,5,5,5,Had large polyp removed by Dr Newton. He made an extremely stressful time so much better. He really cares for his patients. He personally called me to give me the good news that is was benign. He is wonderful.
14,Dr. Thomas R. Newton,Houston,Texas,General Surgeon, Male,11,4.98,2012-05-25T17:04:46Z,5,5,5,5,5,"dr. Thomas Newton , is a smart , funny well informed man . i am having surgey next month but so far he has a good manner . I here he is the best. i will get back with ya'll next month."
15,Dr. Thomas R. Newton,Houston,Texas,General Surgeon, Male,11,4.98,2012-04-20T14:14:47Z,5,5,5,5,5,Dr. Newton is a kind and caring surgeon. He performed colon surgery on me two years ago and through the surgery and follow-ups I have always felt in good hands. He is very thorough and skilled. I would highly recommend him to anyone!
16,Dr. Thomas R. Newton,Houston,Texas,General Surgeon, Male,11,4.98,2011-08-13T13:11:28Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Newton performed colon surgery on me last Summer. He was genuinely caring and professional. He is low keyed and takes time with his patients. The nurses in the hospital said that all of their surgeons were good but there were two whose patients seemed to spend less time in the hospital and healed quicker. Dr. Newton was one of those surgeons. I have every faith that my recovery time was shortened by his skill and knowledge. I cannot recommend this Doctor enough. This was my first surgery and if surgery can be a good experience, this one was. I will go back to him without hesitation and would recommend him to anyone who wants a compassionate and skilled surgeon. Characters typed: (limit: 1000 characters)"
17,Dr. Thomas R. Newton,Houston,Texas,General Surgeon, Male,11,4.98,2010-09-30T01:03:31Z,5,5,5,5,5,Excellent colon and rectal surgeon. Very comfortable with his skills.
18,Dr. Thomas R. Newton,Houston,Texas,General Surgeon, Male,11,4.98,2009-07-20T16:10:46Z,5,5,5,5,5,"My Dr. found cancer during a routine colonoscopy, and recommended Dr. Thomas Newton for my surgery. Dr. Newton took time to explain and educate my Husband and I on my condition and options. We immediately knew we were in good hands, and we were right! Dr. Newton removed my tumor, further biopsy of surrounding areas and lymphs for cancer turned out clear! Dr. Newton is a talented Dr. and a warm, caring and calming man. I recommend him highly!"
19,Dr. Thomas R. Newton,Houston,Texas,General Surgeon, Male,11,4.98,2009-05-13T08:28:58Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Newton took care of my brother as he was treated for anal melanoma. He performed several surgeries and procedures, s we spent a lot of time with him. He often stopped in to see my brother in the hospital, even though my brother was not requiring his services at that time. He stopped by as a friend. He was kind, caring, encouraging and professional. My brother passed away in 2005. Two years later, I went to Dr. Newton for a routine colonoscopy and he remembered my brother and asked about my elderly uncle who often accompanied us to his office. With Dr. Newton's care and concern, he made a very sad and tragic time more bearable and hopeful for us. I think Dr. Newton is a rare doctor who is very skilled and professional but who possesses true concern and caring for his patients. Do not hesitate to chose him as your care provider."

Without him and his team, I would have died. I have undergone two lifesaving operations under him and Dr. Brunicardi is the very best. He has seen me through my recovery and has been there for me.
I am very lucky to have such a most wonderful doctor. My primary doctor called him personally and he didn't hesitate to see me. The staff is absolutely the best. They treat everyone so kind and decent and they take their work serious. They always have a smile and a kind word for the patients. During my stay at the hospital, he came and saw me and told me that he had to go out of town, he said that he would have felt bad if he had left and not checked up on me. I had tears in my eyes, he really cares about his patients, their well being and their recovery. Dr. Brunicardi is the most kindest, decent, caring, doctor and human being. He is a super credit to his profession. I would most definitely recommend Dr. Brunicardi who needs an operation. Thank you so very very much.
God Bless You Dr. Brunicardi.

I didn't find too much that lead me to one Md., it seemed like a crap roll. I called Dr. Mark Frances, my GP, who referred me to Dr. Worley. I was lucky to see him on the same day. His office personnel faxed all necessary paperwork to me and when I arrived it was less than 10 minute wait. I am an operating room Registered Nurse and we are hard patients to please because we get too involved in diagnosing ourselves. I found Dr. Worley to be very professional and listened to my jumble of symptoms. I will have an ultrasound scan and see if the old gallbladder needs to go.

He is extremely knowledgeable in his field and very skilled. He is a straight shooter, does not sugar coat anything, so if you are looking for that in a doctor- I would not suggest visiting him. His office staff was amazingly helpful and caring. During my parents hospital stay every nurse and referring doctor that came and saw my parents reassured us that you are in the best hands with Dr. Echeverri. He by far is one of the best surgeons in Texas. There is something to be said about a doctor that wears jeans and cowboy boot and drive a truck!

I wlake out of the hospital in less than a week. Every Christmas I dropped a thnak you note in his office. He saved my life.If you ask me , He's best cardiac surgeon in Houston. I hope one day he can join me to go deep see fishing for Marlin in Baja, I know he has got some Sails and Marlins in the Caribbean, but in Baja is monster fishing!! He's a great surgeon , but also a straight forward non-nonsense Texan man."

I was out of the hospital in 2 days! Best cardiovascular surgeon. I came from out of town for this operation , and I will if I need anythong else to have him as my surgeon. Excellent office."
58,Dr. Luis G. Echeverri,Houston,Texas,General Surgeon, Male,9,4.19,2012-08-03T13:24:38Z,5,5,5,5,5,"I had a massive heart attack, made it to the Hospital and had cardiac arrest. Dr Echeverri, did a quadruple bypass and put an artificial heart that stayed on for over a week. My heart was too weak to make it. Once my heart recovered , he removed the artificial heart. This nice , handosme cowboy looking guy is the best cardiac surgeon. He is the man for the job."
59,Dr. Luis G. Echeverri,Houston,Texas,General Surgeon, Male,9,4.19,2012-08-01T15:10:18Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Excellent Cardiothoracic surgeon , very knowledgeable, confident. You feel that you are in good hands."

He definitely knows what he is doing. One of the best cardiac surgeons in Houston. Very well respected by colleagues and nurses, i asked the anesthesiologist and several nurses ""Who will you let to operate on your heart?"" they all answered , ""Dr Ech, hes our best surgeon"""
61,Dr. Luis G. Echeverri,Houston,Texas,General Surgeon, Male,9,4.19,2009-03-04T16:24:25Z,1.8,2,2,1,2,"Selected by referring MD for leg amputation. Extremely disrespectful to patient and family, dismissive of request for a second opinion. Contributed to injury of ulcerated foot during examination. May be a good surgeon, but is extremely condescending, arrogant, rough. Patient and family refused to allow him to perform surgery, but he continued to schedule it anyway -- process was stopped at the last minute before transportation to the OR by patient's advocate."

He has excellent bedside manner & more importantly surgeon skills. He has saved my life multiple times over 13 years. I owe everything to him. He realized something was wrong when no one else did. He is also very caring and knowledgeable. He treats all his patients with respect and kindness. There is a reason why so many people love him, respect him, and he is given so many awards. I definitely recommend him and have recommended him to family friends who have also admired him and his work. He is truly a gift from God. "
68,Dr. Joseph R. Cali,Houston,Texas,General Surgeon, Male,5,4.79,2011-06-28T18:56:11Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Cali is awesome. Very knowledgeable and patient in explaining procedures and what to expect. Bedside manner is far and above what you find with most doctors.. Very warm and caring. Treats you with respect. He made the procedure so much more bearable. All of my other physicians and the staff at the hospital had nothing but good things to say about him. Having colon cancer is not the most easy thing to deal with, but having a surgeon that actually cares about his patients makes it so much easier."

He's extremely informative and caring and really knows how to get to the bottom of what is ailing his patients. Sometimes the wait in his office is a little longer then one would like but I attribute it to his all around excellent skills keeping his time in high demand. His staff is also very friendly and well-informed.

72,Dr. Lisa Chen,Houston,Texas,General Surgeon, Female,4,4.69,2010-09-15T18:48:35Z,5,5,5,5,5,"I find her to be a most compassionate and excellent physician. She has performed colon surgery on me and a number of colonoscopies, which helped to save my life. I could not be happier with any colo-rectal surgeon. And I will always return to her as needed. I personally feel the 3 unsatisfactory letters sent here are regarding one patient and should be discounted as such. It is certainly sad when a negative outcome is attained from surgery, but with the number of times the procedure and risks were explained to me by Dr. Chen, other staff in her office and staff in the hospital, it seems almost impossible to imagine someone going into a surgery completely uninformed and unaware. I feel honored to have Dr. Chen as one of my healthcare providers."
73,Dr. Lisa Chen,Houston,Texas,General Surgeon, Female,4,4.69,2010-03-10T22:01:31Z,4.8,5,4,5,5,Dr. Chen is an excellent physician. She takes the time with her patients. She is very compassionate about her work. She is an A+ physician.

She is the most compassionate and understanding doctor I have had regarding my condition. She truly understands what it means to live with this ongoing condition. She has performed several exploratory procedures on me and I have found her to be very cautious and conservative in approaching treatment. She has never pushed me toward surgery or unnecessary procedures. In fact, she has been quite the opposite and been very patient with my reservations about regular colonoscopies. I am very thankful for Dr. Chen and her approach to my health care."

Dr. Sutton performed a left nipple-sparing mastectomy with lymph node biopsy on June 9, 2016. He could not promise prior to surgery that he'd be able to spare the nipple, but it turned out he was able to. The plastic surgeon who performed later reconstruction on the mastectomy site noted that Dr. Sutton had done an excellent job preserving blood flow to the nipple and skin. I could not be happier and would recommend anyone have surgery for breast cancer to see him."

He is extremely knowledgeable in Breast Cancer Surgery. At my first appointment with him he explained ever thing to me about the type of Breast Cancer I had. He was the kindness Dr. I had ever met. I left his office and was very prepared for my procedure. He was so comforting and was very relaxed the day of surgery thanks to Dr. Sutten. I had no pain whatsoever after the procedure. I would recommend Dr. Sutten highly to anyone.

Her words, ""Just call me or come in. Im here all the time"" made me feel like she would be receptive to my needs, and she has been. She is truly a partner in my care she doesnt make my decisions for me, but I know that she will not allow me to make a bad decision. She carefully explains my options, and has been supportive of my decisions. Her bedside manner is EXCELLENT! She is very professional, but with a friendly - even sweet - demeanor."

I am 2014 stage IV Anal cancer discovered with 4 tumors in the liver. They were bilateral plus two central - near potal vein and central arteries. Many doctors would not attempt. But because he learned a new procedure in Tokyo, he was able to remove all four tumors. He also treats each patient as if they were their own family member. He most recently assisted in helping me find another excellent surgeon to remove another tumor in my hilar lymph node and broncos tube. So now I'm a three time survivor and living a normal life including playing tennis. I highly recommend him for complex tumor removals in Hepatic -Pancreatic and Bile Surgeries. His curriculum vitae is impressive! He has written a wonderful instructional atlas book too. I know many other patients he has helped in the same way or at least helping the patient being very compassionate."

Holder-Haynes,Houston,Texas,General Surgeon, Female,5,4.3,2014-06-07T08:50:19Z,5,5,5,5,5,"I am a completely healthy woman who ended up in ER with tremendous stomach pains, which turned out to be a perforated duodenum. Dr. Holder-Haynes was with me for almost 2 weeks in the hospital, NOT doing surgery, as she did everything in her power to help my body heal naturally, which it did. She kept saying how hard it was for her not to just open me up, but that it would be so much better for my body to heal itself. 4 weeks later, I had a follow-up CT scan, and was completely clear. That was about 5 months ago, zero problems since. She was kind, she knew EXACTLY what she was talking about, and she was sympathetic to the fact that I hated being bedridden/NG-tubed, etc. She had other surgeons and drs that worked with her on my case, and together, they formed a team that was kind, knowledgeable, and worked extremely hard to get me out of there in one piece. She even made calls on me over the weekend, which was supposed to be her time off. A++++++."
104,Dr. Juliet G. Holder-Haynes,Houston,Texas,General Surgeon, Female,5,4.3,2013-11-12T13:10:10Z,1.5,3,1,1,1,Worst bed side manner I have ever encountered. She just out to make a dollar and doesn't care about being on time nor preforming surgerys properly. Please find an experienced doctor. Dr.Holder-Haynes should have a career building hamburgers at Mcdonalds. Book smarts and passing a medical board doesn't classify you as a good doctor.

Unfortunately,she no longer takes new patients at her Baylor office and she confines her new patients and all surgery to Ben Taub County Hospital where she is chief of Head and Neck surgery. This is a county hospital and trauma center that also sees patients with Medicare, Medicaid and other insurance as well as indigent patients. Therefore, the wait is very long, the place is crowded and unpleasant waiting rooms. It is not private practice!"
107,Dr. Susan Eicher,Houston,Texas,General Surgeon, Female,3,4.83,2009-03-05T01:41:43Z,5,5,5,5,5,"An excellent head and neck surgeon with 20 years experience.

She worked with Dr.Chevray as he did the reconstruction. She is caring and did a superb job. I would recommend her above anyone in her field. She is the best.
111,Dr. Sherry J. Lim,Houston,Texas,General Surgeon, Female,6,3.83,2011-08-18T10:15:45Z,3.8,1,5,4,5,"Dr. Lim is nice & down-to-earth, but her nurse/staff are cranky, insensitive, & don't take the time to listen or care what your problem is. The staff act like you're bothering them. I thought her nurse was just having a bad day on my 1st visit, but after my post-op visits, I realized how downright rude they are! They talk down at you, roll their eyes, interrupt you when you're talking, & want to close the sliding window unit as soon as possible. You have to press the buzzer for them to open the window again, making you feel like you're interrupting them. I do not like the nurse or the set-up of the office, but Dr. Lim is cool & does good work. I hope I don't have to deal w/ them again!"
112,Dr. Sherry J. Lim,Houston,Texas,General Surgeon, Female,6,3.83,2010-01-10T02:48:00Z,1.5,1,3,1,1,"At the first office visit I took my records and Dr. Lim said she would help me, I am a cancer patient and need more cancer removed. Then a few days later she called me and said for me to find another doctor! Cancer had been left in me at MD Anderson and she trained there and she wanted to stay on staff there but they said they didn't have a place for her there, so she has gone in private practice. She doesn't seem to know what she is doing! She wasted my time and disappointed me. Don't go to her, I don't think she has any concern for patients. She is very cold!"
113,Dr. Sherry J. Lim,Houston,Texas,General Surgeon, Female,6,3.83,2009-03-02T11:49:09Z,3.3,4,5,2,2,"Dr Lim was good when I first met her; helpful wanting to get in and find out what the problem was and fix it. As time went on, she lost interest and started diverting to sending me off to places I did not need to go. How can a doctor be so sure of something on a first visit and then revert to the opposite end of the continuum when there is clearly a problem which she admitted to? She would be a good doctor/surgeon if she could just keep her head straight and not be all over the place."

116,Dr. Matthew J. St. Laurent,Houston,Texas,General Surgeon, Male,4,4.6,2009-03-22T10:01:21Z,3.5,4,4,2,4,"Good surgeon, bad aftercare clinician. St. Laurent performed my Lap-Band surgery 4/1/08. Surgery went well, aftercare has been poor. The doctor always seems rushed, apparently doesn't review my chart just before seeing me, because he never remembers anything about past visits. Worst, when I called him on August 27, panicked (because of my great discomfort) that my band had slipped, he ASSURED me that it was highly unlikely so far after surgery. Visits continued to be rushed, and I consistently had the impression that the doc was not really attending to me during my appointments with him. Now, a year after my surgery, I have to go into surgery again to correct my band, which has, guess what, slipped. Sadly, my August 27 phone call was not recorded in my record, nor were other key communications I made during my visits. I have to pay $5K for corrective surgery; last summer, this may have been corrected without surgery. I recommend audiotaping all clinic visits to keep accurate records."

I asked his office to fax to me the paperwork that would need to be completed. After reviewing paperwork, there were several things that concerned me. First, his office will not file with our insurance company if we do not provide SS#. Due to concerns about identity theft and the fact that our insurance company does not need this information to file a claim, I called and discussed this with office manager Holly and she was very clear that this was the policy and it was not negotiable. Another issue is that the deductible and surgery deposit are due the day the surgery is scheduled, not when the surgery is done. The third issue is that his office wants your entire credit card information the day you first see the doctor so they can automatically charge the outstanding balance on your account. Due to concerns about identity theft, my husband will most likely not see this doctor. "

All office visits were punctual and I had no problem getting in when I called with a worry. He reassured me and was empathetic. The actual surgery was delayed an hour because of a delay in the surgery before me. That could happen to any surgeon. I'm completely satisfied and my husband is now going to see him about a hernia.
122,Dr. Timothy J. Sehorn,Houston,Texas,General Surgeon, Male,5,3.95,2011-06-13T11:10:09Z,3.5,3,4,2,5,"As a surgeon, Dr. Sehorn appeared to be excellent, however there was absolutely no followup after my procedure (gallbladder removal). No one from his office called to check on me, and he did not call, unlike other surgeons I have worked with. Unfortunately, I did have concerns after my procedure, and no way to get answers without going through voice mail hell to speak with a receptionist who simply made a follow-up appointment for two weeks later, and did not ask how I was doing."

Was told lower saphenous vein would be stripped, a procedure I understood and was content with. On the day of surgery the doctor decided to use sclerotherapy which resulted in a softball size area of blackened skin scarring my lower calf. Some bleaching cream was proffered but really had no effect."
125,Dr. Uriel Mushin,Houston,Texas,General Surgeon, Male,5,3.9,2012-03-15T11:37:15Z,5,5,5,5,5,"I was seen by Dr. Mushin for severe leg pain last week for my varicose veins. Dr. Mushin took his time to evaluate my issues and was sincerely compassionate and explained things in a way I could understand. He is a fine physician and have recommended my family members and friends to Dr. Mushin. His office staff is very warm and caring and make you feel like family when you walk in. The facility is state of the art brand new. Very nice! Excellent physician, I highly recommend Dr. Mushin."
126,Dr. Uriel Mushin,Houston,Texas,General Surgeon, Male,5,3.9,2009-11-10T15:12:00Z,5,5,5,5,5,"I was very surprised to see anything but an excellent rating for Doctor Mushin. He recently performed a hernia repair surgery on me and I couln't be any more pleased with the service. The staff was friendly, and he is extremely good at explaining the procedure and answering any and all questions. The only thing that wasn't 100% positive is that the wait times are sometimes long in the office, but I can assure you that this is only because he isn't short cutting any of the other patient's time and answering anything that they need. He is thorough, professional and very pleasant. I really recommend him and the office. He will even take post-surgery calls to his office on his own home phone or cell. I come from a family with a lot of members in the health care field and have been around it all my life. I can only remember one other surgeon who would take calls from patients at any time of the day in any location. He's very service oriented and very pleasant to deal with."

He was encouraging and always teaching. I have not been in Houston for many years. But I carry his teaching with where ever I go. He also taught me never to back down from voicing my opinion to a doctor if I feel they might have over looked something. He told me doctors put on pant's the same as I do. so never back down if you are right. I miss him and he is always in the back of my mind. The best doctor after all these years. He also taught me how to do colonoscopies with him. Now I have issues with my GI, problems with my esophagus and I wish I could ask him about it. Hi DR. Appel from Nelsy Evans worked with you back at Kelsey Seybold Clinic back in 1987. Best Surgeon ever. "

It is run very much like a quick-lube auto shop. Extensive issues with incorrect actions by the office staff after completing a multi-page, everything you wanted to know about me, that contained all the information that managed incorrectly. Over 45 minutes late on the first appointment because they were ""busy"". No response or apology from the doctor after mentioning it at the beginning of the exam. Doctor wanted me to use an out-of-network facility for the surgery, no reason given. I went back to my primary care doctor for another name, as I could not proceed with this incompetence."

He did not spend more than 1 minute!!! Examining my testicle (which was swollen and was the reason I visited him). I asked him about other issues I had and he did not even look at that AT ALL! Over all he spent less than 10 minutes with me. I understand that doctors are busy; NONETHELESS, I PAID 135 DOLLARS FOR A 10 MINUTE VISIT. Come on Dr. Mobley. I HAVE GONE WITH OTHER UROLOGIST ON OTHER STATES (less expensive by the way) AND BEFORE ANYTHING THEY DO A COMPLETE EXAMINATION OF MY GENITALIA TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF ANY PROBLEMS THAT MAY BE PRESENT.

After 2:30 came around they kept telling me 30 more min. I herd that until 5:45pm. Finally got taken back and left the hospital after 8:30that night. 5 days later I called with some questions and concerns about pain. They never returned my call. After waiting all day, finally at 4pm I called again and they apologized. On Friday I called for a Dr.'s note to return to work on Monday and they said they will email it to me. Come Monday still no note. Had to call again and miss half of that day because no one was in the office until the morning.

I arrived and spoke with Rhiannon,Coordinator concerning FMLA documents.I asked that discretion is used documenting my procedure.My request to Rhiannon produced combative behavior toward me,she with held procedure codes.I visited with the doctor and expressed my concern, he agreed it would not be a problem to state my condition briefly.I shared Rhiannon was rude and combative with me which bothered me.I witnessed client checking out and noticed Rhiannon was short tempered with this patient.This whole experience gave me doubts and know I would be mishandled by Rhiannon.I called to speak with Dr. Ata Ahmad to say I had such a bad experience with Rhiannon,I cannot consider approaching surgery at this point.I have not heard from him and I doubt that I will.Rhiannon will be the reason patients will not seek treatment from Dr. Ata Ahmad.Unfortunate I understand he is a good surgeon."

No eye contact, no how are you? She's stares at the computer and multitasking and will make you wait and will not even say ""I will be right with you"". Walmart cashiers have brighter smile that them. They treat you like numbers not patients. No patient rapport at all. Their office phone number is off the hook several times a day. They will not return call as promised by them. You must have the initiative to ask and follow up on things. Dr. Ahmad is very knowledgeable. This is a good experience for me, as a doctor, I will provide my patients a good rapport the minute that I meet them. I will make sure my staffs are aware as well to established a genuine connection."

I was in a very tight spot between my insurance and staff at a hospital and the situation only worked out because of their persistence and willingness to assist. When I was finally able to schedule surgery, Dr. Ahmad was willing to perform the procedure on a holiday weekend to accommodate me. Without his help I would have had to wait about another six months before being able to have the surgery. Thank you, Dr. Ahmad, Rhiannon, and all other staff!!"

My first appt I showed up 10 mins before my appt and waited 65 mins to be seen by him less than 5 min consultation. Then after I had my surgery done I had a follow up about 1 month later. I showed up 5 mins before my appt time and waited 45 mins to be seen and that visit was approx 4 mins long. I felt like he brushed me off, I explained to him that I have some major pain shooting down my arm and laughed it off and said it was just scar tissue. I have serious doubts about this doctor. I WILL be getting a second opinion because I am not a confident about his work!"

He is a very pleasant and empathetic doctor who knows his stuff very well. He addressed all my concerns and provided me with adequate information to make an informed decision.

He is approchable, personable and real. He comes down to the patient level and it feels like you can have a regular conversation with him. He does not have the ""ego"" aura like most specialists do. As a cardiac surgeon, one only has to look at his impressive profile to know he is one the area's best. The best thing I can say about him is that he treats his patients like as if they were one his family members - and thats what every doctor should emulate. Thank you Dr. Mallidi for being a doctor who cares - it is a rare find these days."

He had to come back to operating room to remove second tumor plastic surgeon unmasked under my muscle. He seemed to be surprised it was there. I knew it was there because of the ultra sound and the fact, it was difficult and painful to get to when the biopsy was done. It was a 4cm tumor and if it were not found I don't think I would be here now. I really like Dr. Baker & did not take the mistake further. Now I don't know if that was a good idea. He has lifes in his hands and needs to pay attention. I'm a 8 year breast cancer survivor and I do appreciate Dr. Baker's help."
225,Dr. Treneth P. Baker,Houston,Texas,General Surgeon, Male,6,3.87,2017-07-18T04:10:53.095Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Excellent surgeon! Very kind, compassionate, and explained the procedure thoroughly. "
226,Dr. Treneth P. Baker,Houston,Texas,General Surgeon, Male,6,3.87,2016-01-17T22:13:57.899Z,1.8,2,3,1,1,"Towards the end of 2014, I had visited Kelsey Seybold clinic for a general physical check up. The GP felt a lump on my breast and referred me to the breast clinic for an ultrasound and mammogram. After the ultrasound results came back, I was referred to Dr. Treneth Baker. I had no prior history of breast cancer in my family, but based on the ultrasound and mammograms a biopsy was recommended. However, Dr. Baker told me after looking at my US/mammo reports that I had stage 1 breast cancer, even before the biopsy was conducted. He even told my husband that I would have died within a year if we hadnâ€™t gone in for the check-up. I was 30 at that time and this news shattered me. Me, my family and friends went through unbearable trauma for a week until the biopsy results were out. The biopsy showed that I did not have cancer, and there were some benign breast conditions.
The stress, pain and turmoil that was caused by Dr. Bakerâ€™s irresponsible comment is something that still haunts me. We visited M D Anderson Cancer Center with the biopsy results and were informed that we did not need to take any further action. However, Dr. Bakerâ€™s office called me a month or so later asking to set up an appointment to discuss surgical options. This was just too much for me and I called up Kelsey Seybold and filed a complaint against Dr. Baker. A few weeks later I received a letter from Dr. Bakerâ€™s office telling me that I was ignoring a potentially dangerous condition that can lead to cancer.
I was totally in shock how a Doctor can be hell bent on destroying my life. Essentially I had some benign breast lumps and I can understand doing a biopsy just to be sure. But, the way Dr. Baker scared me into believing that I had cancer, and then when it turned out I didnâ€™t he tried to scare me saying I might have cancer in future, had to be seen to be believed. I still think about the reasons he might do something like that. Either he is so hungry for money that he doesnâ€™t care about his patients at all, or he is just plain ignorant or unqualified when it comes to cancer diagnosis. My experience would suggest the former. He might be good at surgery, but I wanted people to know about my experience before choosing to see him.

Sent home pain increased. Three hours later drove to nearest ER clinic. Morphine wasn't even touching pain. ER doc called Baker needing his ok to admit to hospital. He refused apparently he told ER doc that I was experiencing normal pains. 98% of time no problems with this type of surgery blah blah blah. 7 hours later the ER doc called ambulance. Finally it was discovered that the staple had failed and there was a bike leakage. A stent was put in and my outpatient quickie gallbladder removal turned into a five day hospital stay on antibiotics. I normally would never post such a complaint, but this was a life and death situation. If the ER doc would've listened to his orders not to admit I would have went home to suffer and potentially could have died. Just beware...maybe I was his first and last problem patient. I guess I just happened to be one of those 2%ers."

I really felt like I was in great hands with him. He did a great job of explaining what was going to happen and what my recovery would be like. On the day of the surgery he was very reassuring and warm. I'd certainly recommend him to anyone in need of a surgeon.

Too bad that he is a surgeon and not a general practioner. The healthcare industry needs more like him. You could not have asked to have been treated any better, with more respect, etc. I would highly recommend him to anyone that asked. I had been sick for a long time and no one could figure out what was wrong. I was sent to various internal medicine doctors for different tests and then a tumor was found in my stomach. Dr. Baker said that he believed that was not what was causing the problem and continued to push to find out the problem. Thanks to him, I feel much better. He is GREAT!"

I was in the hospital the whole month of May and Dr. Baker was my surgeon. I had surgery in August and am here today to spend time with my children because of what this man does everyday. He was polite, professional, and knowledgeable. He answered all my questions and even helped me a few times when he was on call. I highly recommend this Doctor. You will not be dissapointed. He also specializes in breast surgery."

I went in for surgery from Dr. Williams and while in my body to remove my kidney he clamped my aorta shut and stitched me back up. Afterwards I was in extreme pain and couldnt feel the lower half of my body. So I had to have another surgery by someone else of course because Dr. Williams obviously doesn't know what he's doing. He kept wanting me to call him Dr. Costanza. He doesn't take anything seriously."

He is very caring and knowledgeable..My father is a new patient and both my father and I were very dissatisfied with his previous urologist (Dr Kar) because he would not answer our questions and seemed always in a rush, he would seem annoyed when we had any questions at all and misdiagnosed my father. Now we are very happy with Dr Williams. He truly cares and is always willing to listen and answer any questions we might have. He is very knowledgeable and explains all procedures in detail..My father and I would recommend him to everyone, we told our primary doctor he should have any patients with prostate issues see Dr Williamsâ€¦."

He has a great bedside manner - compassionate and understanding. He explained everything to me in a way I could understand. It was a blessing that Dr. Williams was the first available Dr. in his office to see me for removal of a catheter and enlarged prostate follow-up. I will definitely go back to this Dr. if the need arises in the future. I highly recommend this Dr. to anyone. Thank you Dr. Williams!

Â He was professional and took all the time I needed to understand the procedure and the need for me to have it. Â It was important to me to have a physician I could talk with easily and not be uncomfortable while discussing personal health issues. Â His willingness to show me the test results and images and explain in detail what those results meant was the point at which I felt I could make a difficult but somewhat sensible decision to go forward with the surgery. Â His manner and repore with his patients is comforting and he followed my progress through until he believed the time was safe to release me from his care. Â I would not hesitate to contact him if I need to and I would certainly recommend him to others.Â  Dr. Mahmood's office staff is friendly and accommodating and the surgical nurses are especially caring.

I had him do the surgery and had a very good experience with him and his personnel. I trust him impeckably. He is truly concerned about his patients, and will follow them through the processes completely. I would rate him a 10 if it went that far.

This office loves to let students practice on you and do a half-assed (no pun intended) job, leading to more follow-up visits where they charge you more money, and if by some miracle you improve, do NOT go back there for any reason. They will lure you with things like ""oh we can't mail this paperwork, and oh this is just a formality visit"" and then make up 15 new charges for you coming in.
In short, the doc is capable but you mainly deal with his students, and the billing department will fleece you at every opportunity. "

I have been told 3 years ago that my sphincter was cut and only surgery would help. I opted not to have the surgery then. Now it has gotten worse so I wanted to get it repaired. I went to Dr Pickron and after testing he told me that my sphincter was fine and the only problem I had was a muscle that was working only 80%. None of which should cause me the kind of problem I was having and suggested therapy. Today I had a colonoscopy and the first thing the doctor told me was that my sphincter muscle had ""no tone"" and was causing my incontinence. Would not trust my dog to this guy."

Thoroughly explained everything to me, discussed all options and possible complications. He was very meticulous. The thoracic team at MD Anderson is just awesome Dr. Scott and Dr Heyz so compassionate and kind. I had an open sternotomy and was given a block. I had ZERO ...ZERO pain not a drop.

You should try Tylenol or ibuprofen for the pain."" Gee, thanks doc. I hadn't thought to try over the counter pain medication myself.

I waited one hour and 45 minutes despite this. I saw the Dr. for under 10 minutes to discuss the test results, and could have done this over the phone because the test results were all fine. I BEGGED to do this over the phone multiple times due to my situation, as well as the Doctor's promise to do so on my previous visit, but was blown off by Lymari and the Dr. I missed my flight and wasted 3 hours for NOTHING, after being promised I could get results over the phone. The only reason my session with the Dr. lasted almost 10 minutes was because he gave me ridiculous advice--don't workout my abs. For anyone with lower back problems, developing a strong ""core"" is #1 on the action list by ALL physical therapists. This visit was only for the Dr. to make money, even if he had to lie, make me miss my flight, and give me horrible medical advice."

I am also eternally grateful to my mom for being too scared and not wanting me to get surgery from this bas-tard especially. I cannot begin to discuss his callous bedside manner, but most of you are spot on. He walks around like we're wasting his time. He needs to retire because he is not only unwanted in the industry, he is also quite useless. He doesn't do one of the safest procedures out there ( lapband) and manages to mess up the procedures that he can do and ruins peoples lives.

Everyone seemed to feel as I have felt for years. He performed gastric surgery on me in February 2002 and I was left traumatized by the surgery. Even though I was extremely sick, I felt as though he could care less. He did not even visit me while I was still at the hospital to see how I was doing. He had to be the most arrogant doctor I have ever met. He basically makes you feel as though you are wasting his time. It took me 3 years to get over that surgery. Steer clear of him!!!"

When he talked with my daughter and I prior to a simple appendectomy, he was extremely rude and unwilling to help us understand by saying, ""What did I just tell you?"" Two weeks post-surgery, I experienced a collapsed bowel which he said was not uncommon following an appendectomy. He needs to retire."

He dismissed it as ""being all in my head."" Davis was not in his office for one of my appointments and I saw his son, who finally realized the problem was that rather than being the size of a 50 cent piece, the opening at the end of my esophageous was the size of a coffee stirrer! I had to have 17 esophageal dialations to try to enlarge the opening. All indications were that Davis miscalculated a piece of equipment, but no one from the operating room would testify against him. He denied all liability and I had to pay for all the dilations. This was 4 years ago and I must still have a dilation at least once each year. Robert Davis is an arrogant hack."

I called concerning the pain medication he prescribed to me, but his staff kept screening the calls and giving their own advice on pain management. After demanding to speak to the doctor, I finally got a hold of him, but he was very stingy prescribing me an alternate pain medication. I was not having a good experience with the Vicotin his initially gave me, and he said he could not prescribe me anything stronger, and there wasn't anything else that would work well. He seemed very reluctant to help with pain management, and his staff took an excessive amount of time calling in a new prescription. I would not recommend Doctor Garner due to his inability of him, and his staff to listen to his patients' needs."

There were no surprises and it ended up being the best decision I made in a long time. I should have had the surgery sooner. Definitely recommend him. Only downside was that I waited about 45 min past my appointment time to finally see him- he was worth the wait though. 
269,Dr. James Gregory Bonnen,Houston,Texas,General Surgeon, Male,16,2.58,2018-07-05T15:11:41.073Z,2,4,2,1,1,"Staff was nice. About the only positive of this experience. We should have done research and read reviews ahead of time. Only went with him because there are no other choices that have hours in lake jackson. His bed side manner is terrible. Less than 3 minutes of discussion at initial consult. Scheduled MRI for back pain that has persisted for 6 months. Results showed nothing that would be causing pain so he recommended physical therapy to strengthen the lower abdominal muscles and/or steroid injections into the spine. Went with PT but quickly realized 130 dollars a visit for sit up exercises was ridiculous. I knew something was wrong so had a CT scan scheduled. Results of the CT scan showed a concerning mass in lower kidney.....totally unrelated to the back pain. My primary care dr. Asked to see the results of the MRI. I showed him what I had and he said those were only the notes and he wanted to see the full report. After he reviewed tge report he said in the MRI report a 2 cm mass was noted in my kidney and it was recommended to follow up with an ultra sound. None of this was mentioned to my in my review of the MRI with Dr. Bonnen. Luckily it was caught with the CT scan and being dealt with at MD Anderson. Sad that Bonnen didnt mention it was critical that I follow up with an ultrasound. Without the CT scan that I decided to do on my own intuition the mass very likely would have grown for years until it was stage 3 or 4 cancer.
Save yourself the experience and use the review information and go see a reputable doctor in Houston. "

He spent a total of 5-7 minutes in the exam room. Did not adequately answer my questions. Diminished my symptoms by saying that my pain did not ""seem serious"". Most frustrating was the advice to see a pain management doctor and prescribed Tramodol. He stated that it was not a narcotic. However after taking the medication and feeling worse, I decided to research Tramodol. Come to find it is listed as a narcotic and antidepressant drug. He stated that I would be able to drive after taking the medication. Needless to say, I was really unable to much of anything. I was not informed of the side effects of the high risk of addiction with Tramodol. I am very disappointed and will not go to this provider again. "

I drove over 200 miles to see this doctor and when I arrived at his office, I find out that my appointment, PLUS 2 other adults and their 2 children were all scheduled for a 2:30 appointment.
I waited for over an hour, but with the screaming and allowed to run wild children, while their mother played games on her phone. I never saw the doctor and asked for a refund of my co-pay and I left his office. Do yourself a favor, FIND ANOTHER DOCTOR."

First time he didn't even examine me and interrupted me while I was explaining to him my pain concerns. I felt like he didn't give me the time or effort. After MRI's he never called me back and we got a call from assistant telling us they basically couldn't help us. I'm still suffering from back pain.

I have never been talked to in such a rude, condescending manner as this doctor spoke to me. He is arrogant and didn't show a shred of interest or compassion for my problem with an extruded disc. He made me feel like a complete idiot for wasting his time. My purpose was to find out if there were other treatment options besides the spinal injections which gave me temporary relief. He never would answer my question but twisted it to make it seem as though I wanted him to predict when/if my pain was going to return stating that ""his crystal ball was broken"". My only act of stupidity was taking off work and driving 100 miles round trip to see him. It makes his website testimonial about putting the needs of his patients first a real joke. As for his run for political office - I wouldn't vote for him if he was the only person running! Treating a patient like this is inexcusable."

He was running 4 hours late and his office staff did not even have the decency to call and notify me. Instead, they chose to just make me wait for F-O-U-R hours in the waiting area in the clinic without saying anything to me. Very unacceptable.

But quite going to him when one day out of nowhere one of the front office girls called my mother (90 yrs old) and told her she would have to find another doctor. With no reason.

They tell patients frequently that the doctor is very busy. This made me feel that my doctor was too busy to take adequate care of his patients. He was always in a hurry. He didnt document instructions that he gave me in my chart or treatments that he had tried to treat my phlebitis and venous reflux. Documentation was not sent to the insurance company in a timely manner. I was simply dropped as a patient without any notice. I had to find another doctor to help me and who would also document his treatments and follow up with his patients and their care.

289,Dr. Adam Naaman,Houston,Texas,General Surgeon, Male,4,3.65,2007-05-11T08:49:41Z,4.7,,4,5,5,"Dr. Naaman is very factual and to the point in his manner. He is extremely knowledgeable and skilled. He did my RNY gastric bypass, and was excellent with pre-surgical information. There wasn't a lot of post-op support (nutrition counseling, etc.) at the time, but his office has improved 200% since then. They now maintain an on line support group as well as support groups in Houston. I highly recommend this doctor and his staff. They saved my life, and many others."

291,Dr. Thirumalairaj Jayakumar,Houston,Texas,General Surgeon, Male,1,5,2014-11-10T10:40:21.731Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Jayakumar did my open RNY gastric bypass over 13 years ago, as well as my gall bladder surgery, and three hernia repairs. He also did my husband's hernia repair surgery. We felt at ease with him immediately, as well as with his wonderful staff, he is very knowledgeable and I researched the bariatric surgeons in the Houston area for over a year before actually deciding to go with Dr. J. It turned out that our long-time family GP and pediatrician was also Dr. J's family doctor and when I told him that I was researching surgeons, he immediately recommended Dr. J. I have been so thrilled with my results... I lost 70 pounds in the first 7 months, and a total of 150 pounds over 13 months, losing half of my starting weight of 300 pounds! I was overjoyed! Now, I will say there are risks involved in such a serious undertaking... This IS a major surgery and should not be taken lightly. I had previous serious health issues which contributed to my struggle with my weight and factored heavily into my decision to have the surgery, some of which continued afterward. One of these issues was blood clots in the lungs (aka pulmonary emboli), which are life-threatening, which showed up in my lungs again after the surgery. Another complication was the 80+ gallstones that caused excruciating pain and another surgery to be done. Regardless, I would still have had the surgery despite the complications. I am so thankful for Dr. J and his team! I have since had two more wonderful daughters and my stomach has stretched out a bit, but I am still 120 pounds down from where I started over 13 years ago! Dr. J is the best!"

302,Dr. David D. Shin,Houston,Texas,General Surgeon, Male,1,5,2009-02-04T18:04:15Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Shin and his staff worked very hard to make sure I got a favorable result. He has a great bedside manner and his staff are friendly and effective as well. It's obvious everyone there is very competent and focused. I have had several procedures (RF ablation of two valves, sclerotherapy, and excisions) and am pleased with the results of all of them. His office is comfortable and there's been no problem or even inconvenience working with my insurance. One of the aspects I like best about my experiences with Dr. Shin is that he has done all of the procedures with no sedation, anesthesia, or even stitches. They did everything I can imagine to make dealing with a pretty advanced case of 'chronic venous insufficiency' and varicosity in the leg as comfortable, hassle-free, and cost-effective as possible."

It was a consultation for possible gall bladder sugery. I was with my husband. Dr. Pon came in the room and literally was raising his voice at me saying ""Why do you think you need surgery? It's probably your ovary anyway."" He chided me for even coming there. I was sent by my doctor! I did not want surgery! He persisted in his rude talk and started yelling at me. He is extremely rude. Guess what? I felt myself starting to tear up so I got up and went to the restroom. I could hear him in the room with my husband changing his tune and saying just how he was concerned about me. WTH? I decided then to just leave, so I popped my head in the exam room and told my husband we were leaving. Which we did. I have never been treated so rudely by anyone, in my whole life! Especially a dr that I paid a few hundred dollars only to be yelled at! I would never go back and never recommend him to anyone, ever!"

The experience I have had with him is that of pure unprofessionalism. He could care less about you as an individual and patient. My surgery was in February 2012, and not only did he go on vacation afterwards, but I had to receive my results from a physician who never met me, and on top of that this doctor could not explain to me the cancer that was found and so on. By the end of my very first Post Op appointment after surgery I was in tears. It has been over a month now and I am having the same problems, so instead of Dr. Parke taking the extra step to get to the root of the problem, he puts a tube down my nose and tells me that my vocal chords are fine!!! Then he politely sends me on my way. He didnâ€™t give me but seven minutes of his time as though I am a number not a human being!"

Dr.Parke made the surgery sound so simple and stated that I would have a FULL recovery and look exactly the same, however, this was NOT the case. I am 26 year old female who 3 months post surgery not only has significant pain on the right side of my face, but also has not regained my chin movement back making me look awkward when I smile- not only has the surgery hurt me physically but emotionally. My self confidence has gone down the drain- I refuse to take pictures ever. He LIED to me and stated things would be fine within a month BUT they were NOT. DO NOT go to him. He just wants your business!!!!"

Spent time answering all of my questions prior to surgery and was reassuring throughout the entire process from pre-surgery visit, day of surgery and afterwards. Good surgeon all around. The scars healed nicely too."

366,Dr. Ziad Amr,Houston,Texas,General Surgeon, Male,1,4.5,2010-06-15T15:28:08Z,4.5,4,4,5,5,"Dr. Amr is a fantastic no nonsense doctor who is honest and expects allot from the patient. He would be great for anyone looking to do either the Lap-Band or By-Pass that needs structure and guidence. I am three weeks post surgury and I would recomend him to anyone considering any type of surgery. He was well recommeded by another ""well respected and famous"" doctor who performed surgery on Barbara Bush recently. The only issue I have seen is in the paperwork section of the back office and the issue I did have was correctly quickly. His assistant is top notch and very easy to get in contact with as she always either answers the phone or calls you back promptly. Dr. Amr is a first rate doctor with hospital privalages at the best hospital in Houston (Methodist)."

She does not have a good bedside manner. Her demeanor is on the rough side. She made a negative saying about my husband's urologist. I did not like that. She did not diagnose me. This was my second visit with her and the first one was not a hit either but I thought I would give her another chance as there just is not many female urologists in Houston. The second visit was worse. She was more interested in getting information for her electronic machine. Again, she is not a warm and fuzzy physician. Not comfortable in asking too many questions, to her.
I am tired of bladder pain and micro blood seen in the urine. Something is not right. "
368,Dr. Karen A. Delhey,Houston,Texas,General Surgeon, Female,6,2.54,2014-02-21T11:51:19Z,3,4,2,3,3,"I was recommended by her through my primary case physician. Wished I had gotten someone else, as she seems completely aloof and I got the distinct feeling I was bothering her with follow up questions. I'm in the middle of getting another urologist, as when I went back for my follow up, she didn't give me much of advice or answers. I understand that bladder/urethra issues are hard to diagnose but she seemed to make no effort to actually find out what I might have. She threw a few phrases of possible diagnosis and threw some medications at me. I'm more lost than I was before."
369,Dr. Karen A. Delhey,Houston,Texas,General Surgeon, Female,6,2.54,2014-01-08T12:59:45Z,1.8,3,2,1,1,"I have to agree with the reviewer(s) who found her aloof and pretentious. I only saw her once, on referral, was told she was the best. She didn't help me at all, seemed completely disinterested. Because my pain was so gut-wrenching and I was willing to do anything, I found some supplements that saved my life. When she did return my call, she giggled and basically said the supplements were a ""freak accident"" without using those words. I found her rude and uncaring. Her nurse even giggled when she told me at my visit that many of their patients just ""deal with bladder pain."" I'm not a whiner and this was the worst 2 months of my life, dealing with the pain. Dr. Delhey not only didn't help, she didn't care."

Delhey,Houston,Texas,General Surgeon, Female,6,2.54,2007-12-31T15:19:47Z,1.5,2,1,2,1,"This is my opinion - others may have had different experiences - Dr Delhey is thorough with the paper work, lab results... the post-appointment or the follow-up stuff . To me, the actual visit to the doctor was very mediocre. I don't mean to be rude but she seemed pretentious and if you're curios about something or if you ask her questions, you might tick her off. Inspite of all these, I would have recommended her if she hadn't given me the most inconclusive decision I've ever heard in my life which made me wonder if there was something wrong with my body or if my mind was making it up. I ended up utterly confused...."

I never saw him after my prolapse surgery, only his resident. His very pleasant staff made my follow-up appointment on a day when he was supposed to be out of town. Fortunately, I discovered the error and had the appointment changed. Meanwhile, I developed such severe nerve pain from the positioning in surgery (not his fault--it's standard positioning) and he put me back in the hospital. Unfortunately, when I got to Admissions, I found that his staff had given them the next day's date, and I was stranded in the hospital lobby. Getting the order changed added an extra hour to my 3-hour wait for a room. At my final appointment Dr. Snyder remarked that I had ""low tone"" but gave no suggestions on how to deal with this . When I asked him if he wanted to look at my incision, he said yes and a minute later was half-way out the door. I had to remind him to check, the incision. He said to come back in a year. No matter how great his surgical skill, I won't come back ever"
374,Dr. Michael J. Snyder,Houston,Texas,General Surgeon, Male,5,2.65,2013-02-18T15:23:22Z,4.5,4,4,5,5,"I've been going to Dr. Snyder for 10 yrs. He performed a complete colectomy and J pouch on me. My surgery and follow up could not have been better. My post care has been nothing short of excellent. He discovered a very small, very aggressive cancer in my colon that others had not found & which required specialized post treatment. He is a perfectionist and demands excellence out of everyone around him. I like that he is a teaching fellow as it makes him better by teaching other doctors. We always have a good conversation. He asks me good questions and good follow ups, and is responsive to my questions. I've sent others to him who all report the same care and caring."

Snyder,Houston,Texas,General Surgeon, Male,5,2.65,2011-08-14T11:23:05Z,1.8,3,2,1,1,"I am very disappointed with a recent visit to this Dr. I made an appointment due to some complications I was having. He immediately recommended a costly proceedure. Three weeks after the proceedure I received a call from his nurse saying everything was normal. I asked ""what about my original symtoms?"" and she suggested I make another appointment (at an addittional cost) to ask about my original symtoms - AGAIN. I said no thanks - I'll find someone else more responsive! NOT VERY HELPFULL AT ALL!"

Highly uneducated and lazy staff . Poor follow up care . Lack of attention to detail is extreme and reckless . Most of the time there is no office clinical staff and there is a high rate of turn over ! I would avoide this surgeon because of his office staff and lack of staff.

He removed a cyst, stitched me up and asked me to come back in 4 days. I did, the drain was removed and he asked me to come back in 2 weeks! I had no idea at the time how long stitches should remain in and when they should be taken out. Well before the two weeks was up, my stitches began to imbed themselves in my skin because they had been in too long. A good doctor would have known when to take them out. Needless to say, my husband had to pull them out of my skin and cut them out before I could get seen by Simon Karni. Now I have an awful looking scar with the stich marks. Aside from the care, their appointment scheduling is awful. The receptionist told me they tell everybody 11 AM. Who does that? The office is always super packed and the wait takes forever. I would not recommend this doctor to anyone I know!"

I wonder if anyone else has had a complaint about this doctor out of Houston, TX. This was for an impairment rating which is very important to anyone that has been injured as severe as I.

Dont leave a voicemail if you want to talk to them we left 4 voicemails in 3 days and never got a return call.

He noted on my form that I needed a colonoscopy, and that he could take some pictures of my anal area and we could discuss the operation afterwards. The morning of the colonoscopy I could tell that I still had liquid in my colon. I told the nurse that prepped me and she said the doctor would take care of it. While waiting in the procedure room I informed a different nurse and the anesthesiologist about my fluid retention and they both said the doctor would take care of it. Later, I learned that the doctor arrived late. He did nothing about the fluid in my colon and as I was coming out of the anesthesia, he came in with four photos, one showing an unknown amount of fluid in my lower colon. He said that the colonoscopy would have to be done over but it wouldnâ€™t be a problem because I had met my insurance deductible. So I ended up with an $1800 bill for a blotched procedure and absolutely no help for my condition."

426,Dr. Richard Cunningham,Houston,Texas,General Surgeon, Male,2,1.25,2010-07-19T20:08:22Z,1.3,2,1,1,1,"I went in for an abortion procedure. I got there at 9:30am for my 10:30am apointment the doc. didn't show up till 2:30pm. He started the surgery befor i was sedated. I was screaming in pain, he yelled at me to shut up it was not that painful. He then left me lying on the opperating table for ten min just bleeding. I finally passed out from the pain. The he and a nurse came in and asked me to sign a paper that its not there fault if the procedure didn't work when I was medicated, which is illegal! They then left me lying on the table still bleeding and in extreem pain. The nurse never helped me get up, get dressed, or cleaned me off. I had to do it myself. And to top off the horrifying experience, their paper work says that they are suppos to wheel you out to your car, I had to walk hunched over in pain with my fieance to the car. I did recive anti biotics they were in a paper envelop. I pray no one ever has to go through this tourtureous experience. I would never recomend this doctor."

This doctor after feeling my prostrate said he believed I could have cancer. I immediately went to my original urologist that has 45 years of experience. He checked me and said I have no issues. I guess this Dr. Tan wants to make extra money by abusing his patients. Beware of this doctor.

I used to hear this quack doctor tell her research nurse to pressure a patient to sign an inform consent in a certain way ( so that she can use their leftover DNA cells for her expirement) . To me that sounded wrong and mischevious, she would laugh with the research person about it too. I personally think she is evil and has no morals. When speaking to her you can get the sense that she thinks she is better than you. She has no humility. I would never ever go to her if I were a patient."
429,Dr. Funda Meric-Bernstam,Houston,Texas,General Surgeon, Female,2,1.13,2015-07-23T06:33:26.022Z,1.3,2,1,1,1,"So first off, her staff makes the best effort do well with the resources and leadership they have. They tend to be good hearted and competent people.
This doctor herself was an absolute nightmare. She kept us waiting for almost an hour for our grandmother who was about to pass out from the pain and weakness of our cancer, turned out she was aware but was caught up in a social conversation.
She then proceed to confidently give us wrong information about our cancer's tumor markers and immediately work to pressure us into one of the treatments she's leading.
She also receives significant speaking fees from the companies she does trials for (look it up, part of public disclosure). To top it all off, she looked the other way when there were warning signs about a close colleague an a man she was having an affair with, and covered for her after she tried to kill him (look up Dr. Ana Maria Gonzalez-Angulo).
Avoid this doctor unless you have to go to her for some reason. Good luck. There are many great doctors at MD Anderson, but this is not one of them (and she should probably have her license revoked)

The office said he was ""assigned"" to be my doctor. I never even met him and he did surgery on me at Methodist, and insensitive when I asked him about this after surgery. Not OK!!! Reading the other review, I guess this is the norm at Methodist. I will not be back to to this office"

Never saw me in the hospital after my surgery so I can't comment on his bedside manner, worst possible? I actually feel violated by the whole experience at Methodist. Do not recommend"
432,Dr. Reshma R. Brahmbhatt,Houston,Texas,General Surgeon, Female,1,1,2012-04-17T08:51:56Z,1,1,1,1,1,"Terrible, miserable, and worthless human being"
433,Dr. Suryam Kodali,Houston,Texas,General Surgeon, Male,1,1,2017-11-02T22:16:23.667Z,1,1,1,1,1,"I had a terrible experience with Dr. Kodali. I didn't really have a choice in surgeons since I was admitted with appendicitis from the emergency room.
When I asked for an explanation of the surgery before I consented, the surgeon showed up a few minutes before the scheduled surgery and threatened to cancel the surgery. After asking what was going to be done, I got a very basic explanation and the surgeon left. I felt like I didn't know what was planned for the surgery, but I decided to consent because I was afraid the surgeon would cancel my slot if I didn't just accept whatever he was going to do.
The next time I saw Dr. Kodali, he showed up the morning before I was supposed to be discharged to remove a drain tube. I had been having trouble urinating since the surgery. He speculated that he might have placed the drain tube against my ""bladder"" or something... shrugged and started yanking out the drain tube. It hurt a lot and reaggravated the pain in my ""bladder"" area again. He was very careless with the drain tube and flung blood all over the hospital room.
In the paperwork I received on discharge, Dr. Kodali had asked that I follow up with him in 5 days.
I started to call the number provided on the following day and got a voicemail and left a message. I did the same the following 5 days. No one ever called back. I tried again the following Monday and still got voice mail. Finally I got a callback and they only had one opening the next Thursday. I took it.
On the day of the appointment, I got to his office, and they put me in a room. and there I sat for nearly 2 hours. There was nothing in the office; I had nothing to distract me, no one came back to let me know the doctor was delayed.
I was ready to walk out when the doctor finally showed up.
He didn't know who I was or why I was there. He fumbled with his notes and poked me in the stomach a bit and asked me if there was any pain. He said he wanted to see me again in 3 months and walked out of the treatment room. Not an apology for being late. He didn't tell me anything I didn't know. And he expected me to show back up for more of this kind of treatment.
Then I go to the desk to check out. First, his assistant tried to schedule the follow up which I declined. I told her I would follow up with my primary care physician. Next the assistant didn't know if I owed anything even though they had collected my insurance information. I was sure there was a copay, but no idea what. She finally decided it was $60. I got out my credit card and she informed me at that point they don't take debit or credit at all. There was no indication of this when I made the appointment, in the waiting room or anywhere else.
I drove to a nearby ATM to get cash to pay for the visit.
I really hoped it was over, but when I returned with the cash, she asked if I needed a receipt. Of course I said yes. And she hand wrote out a hand receipt on a generic sales slip. It had no identifying information on it for the practice or doctor.
Overall this surgeons whole practice was very unprofessional. I had a great stay in the hospital other than these interaction with Dr. Kodali. If would never recommend anyone use this surgeon if they have a choice.
I have no dought his surgical work was adequated, but his people skills and the organization he runs is wholly inadequate."

I am, and was, 13 and he talked so i could understand him. My surgery was un-determined because he had to see my heart first. When he went into surgery he first did a repair but he wasn't satisfied with the results. He then decided to do the Ross Procedure. My surgery ended up being around 11 hours long. He hung in there and finished it the right way. I ended up only staying in the hospital for 3 days, unlike the doctor's expectation of 7-10. Now, I have almost no ""side effects"" with my heart repair, except a small arrhymia, which is common. Now I can run and do pretty much any sports I want to. Prior to surgery, I could not participate in any strenuous activity because it could lead to heart failure. Ya so Dr. Fraser is SO awesome and he really cares about his patients! ~~ <3 ~~ Cailey"
