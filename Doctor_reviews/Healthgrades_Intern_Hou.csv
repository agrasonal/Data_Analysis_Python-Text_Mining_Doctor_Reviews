0	Feb 14, 2019	5	Internal Medicine	Dr. Jose Cuellar Silva	Webster,	2	5	He is the best dr. I went to him because my arrhythmias were not better with meds.  He put in a pacemaker nearly a year ago. It has given me a new lease on life. He is very compassionate and takes the time to explain and answer my questions. He even called to talk to me while I was at Bay Area Regionsk. I highly recommend him. 	5	10 – 15 minutes	TX	5	5.0	5

4	May 08, 2018	3	Gastroenterology	Dr. Daniel Darmadi	Houston,	21	3	Dr. Darmadi is a great doctor.  However, I can't say the same about his assistant.  She DOES NOT return calls, even urgent ones.  During my last visit, I had to wait for her to get through talking on the phone to the college trying to find out how to register for classes.  Perhaps this is why she has no time to return urgent calls.	3	16 – 30 minutes	TX	2	3.3	3
5	Feb 01, 2018	3	Gastroenterology	Dr. Daniel Darmadi	Houston,	21	3	From the very first visit Dr Darmadi has been very thorough and very concentrated on diagnosising my condition. He has ordered all the proper test and fought with insurance to approve proper meds. 	3	16 – 30 minutes	TX	5	3.3	3
6	Nov 17, 2017	3	Gastroenterology	Dr. Daniel Darmadi	Houston,	21	3	I would not recommend ever using Dr.Darmadi for anything. He diagnosed me with chronic pancreatitis without even running the correct test..Went to medical center and had correct test run and by the grace of God I don't have chronic pancreatitis. So if I was anyone that is having any abdominal pain at all I highly recommend that you go somewhere else. Oh and the office staff is very unprofessional and very rude. If they make a mistake it always seems to be turned around on you the patient..	3	16 – 30 minutes	TX	1	3.3	3

9	Apr 24, 2019	4	Interventional Cardiology	Dr. Gerardo Kalife	Houston,	13	4	Our family loves Dr. Kalife and would/have recommended him to numerous people.  My parents are in their mid and early nineties so putting them into the car and up to his office only to be told that our appointment had been changed is very upsetting.  We have had the same problem in the last several visits.  I am not sure if it is a problem with this site or the doctors office.  I finally found out yesterday that he doesn’t even take morning appts.  I tried for three days to reach his office to set an appt verbally but finally resorted to this site.  I received a confirmation text that my mother’s appointment was at 11:45 am.  I had to take off work to take her only to find out someone changed the appt to 4pm.  Who changes appts without notifying the patient???? Again, I was very unhappy and actually had to show the front receptionist my phone as proof noting the confirmation I received showing an 11:45 am appointment.  Someone needs to work on the site to remove the morning options.	5	10 – 15 minutes	TX	5	4.7	5

He did give me a coupon for a new med, though, so at least he made some $.This practice (including nurse Elena Stockton) left me feeling like a profit unit. I have no confidence in Dr Desai whatsoever.	3	Under 10 minutes	TX	1	3.4	4
292	Feb 18, 2017	4	Internal Medicine	Dr. Minesh Desai	Houston,	22	4	Dr. Desai is amazing.  This clinic has had a lot of doctor turnover.  Dr. Desai has been there now the longest so I hope he stays!!!!!!	3	Under 10 minutes	TX	5	3.4	4
293	Aug 04, 2016	4	Internal Medicine	Dr. Minesh Desai	Houston,	22	4	I'm a doctor and see Dr. Desai for my care.  I was referred to him from other medical colleagues.  He is indeed the doctor's doctor because many of us go to him for our care.  He is thorough and caring.  Most people who have a great experience don't bother to leave reviews but I felt compelled to leave one after a recent visit.  If you care about your health, go see him. 	4	16 – 30 minutes	TX	5	3.4	4
294	Aug 03, 2016	4	Internal Medicine	Dr. Minesh Desai	Houston,	22	4	It was not a good experience. He didn't even do my blood work when I visited him with my illness.  Found an alternative Dr by myself.	4	16 – 30 minutes	TX	1	3.4	4
295	May 26, 2016	4	Internal Medicine	Dr. Minesh Desai	Houston,	22	4	My experience was poor.  I found Dr. Desai to be condescending.  My annual physical exam was incomplete:  he never listened to my heart or lungs, he did not look into my throat or eyes, he did not ask me about sleep apnea, despite it being listed on my history form.	4	16 – 30 minutes	TX	1	3.4	4
296	Feb 15, 2018	4	Internal Medicine	Dr. Cynthia Williams	Houston,	41	4	I loved Dr. Williams bedside manner and she actually takes the time to talk to you about your health!  The only downfall is that her office/nurse NEVER returns phone calls.  I was awaiting the results of a test and I guess it's normal because no one ever called me or sent me an update.  I tried calling the office 3 times to get results and was sent to voicemail where my message went to die (I suppose) b/c no one called me back.  She needs better staff.	4	10 – 15 minutes	TX	3	4.0	4
297	Nov 30, 2017	4	Internal Medicine	Dr. Cynthia Williams	Houston,	41	4	Dr Williams was a fantastic doctor. I think her office might be too busy now, or something, because I canNOT get a nurse to call me back. And last July, when I went for my booked appointment, Dr Williams didn't even show up, she went home with a migraine. Perhaps a follow up call or some sort of contact would have been nice. Plus i was charged for the appointment! I am very frustrated here, I actually need the nurse to call me back! When I can SEE  DR Williams she is nice. 	4	10 – 15 minutes	TX	3	4.0	4
298	Nov 17, 2016	4	Internal Medicine	Dr. Cynthia Williams	Houston,	41	4	Fantastic, caring, goes beyond to help her patients.  I think all of us feel so blessed to have her caring for us. Her staff is wonderful and follows her excellent lead. 	4	10 – 15 minutes	TX	5	4.0	5

She mainly refers when she could deal with health issues herself.  I believe that her primary role is that of seeing as many patients in as short a time as possible . I felt that going to an internist as opposed to go to a general MD would facilitate more hands on and less referring.  I was wrong.  	3	16 – 30 minutes	TX	1	4.2	4

I had allergy reaction to that medication, and he didn't care. I'm glad that I saved my life by stop going to him. 	4	Under 10 minutes	TX	1	2.7	3

And then they charged me for the visit, even though all I did during the visit was collect my results and leave. Lack of transparency for such mundane stuff to make extra $$ is a red flag in my book.	4	Under 10 minutes	TX	1	2.7	None

I was between 22 and 27 years old when I saw this doctor for an annual exam. Nothing was wrong with me but I wanted to get my A1C and cholesterol levels checked. In my patient history, I wrote that I had my annual well women’s exam already. I might have told him verbally that I already had my well women’s exam. Although he knew this, he pinched my nipples for abnormal discharge. I was not complaining about my boobs but he said he was going to do that “just to make sure.” I was too embarrassed to let the clinical staff know about this inappropriate situation.

After the month they told us that at MD Anderson oncologist change shifts and we ended up with Dr. Farajoli which was a bad move on MD Anderson’s part to us. I mean I know our patient was ill but we don’t understand how when we first arrived at MD Anderson she was very ill in ICU and the ICU staff did an extremely great job to bounce her back up and get her to the leukemia floor with doctor Masarova as her oncologist weeks later Masarova did her most best to try a treatment plan which was helping and other options which seem to be helping our patient but then once Farajoli stepped in all options were denied and we lost.	4	10 – 15 minutes	TX	1	3.7	3

Very knowledgeable, and spends enough time going over my health issues. She is able to quickly decide if she can help, or refer me to a specialist, and her diagnosis was always precise, and treatment always worked! which is rare in my experience. Disappointed that she had left the practice in Katy, and now I have to find someone else. Wait time is relatively long, maybe because she spends good time with patients	3	None	TX	5	4.4	None

1871	May 16, 2018	4	Internal Medicine	Dr. Ronald Killam	Houston,	16	None	Dr. Killam doesn't visit this office but the medical professionals seem fine. The problem is the non-medical staff. They are friendly and courteous but incompetent and the office is very poorly run. Anything administrative, even the simplest thing, is hit or miss. Faxes sent to them by other medical offices are apparently just thrown away. The good thing is I had developed A LOT of medical conditions and the NP has been willing to refer me for necessary tests, which has been a life-saver.	None	None	TX	3	3.6	None

Its impossible to get a phone call returned or any issue with medication and insurance resolved. Complete lack of professionalism from the admin staff here.  I would trust my health care to a school nurse before recommending this office.  I'm not sure about the Dr. as I've never met him in 5 yrs as his patient.

I explained that I have prolonged bleeding and abdominal pain that swelled my stomach and throat very bad, the response was again go see a psychiatrist.

On my very first visit, he listened carefully to my issues and examined me physically. All of my questions were answered.  Lab work was requested which resulted in hyperthyroid.  Immediately, I met with an endocrinologist and was given medication. Had Dr. Nautiyal not suspected a possible thyroid issue, I probably would be very, very ill. He's professional, compassionate and very smart.	None	None	TX	5	5.0	None
