Cuando recibimos los resultados de mis exámenes nos llevamos la sorpresa que tenía un Fibroma tumor de 15 cm, el me dio inmediatamente el pase para una Ginecóloga aquí en Salinas Monterey CA del Hospital ""Salinas Valley Memorial Healthcare"", no voy a decir su nombre, pero ella me recomendo dos opciones la primera era una histerectomia parcial y la segunda opción era una histerectomia completa a mis 35 años de edad, me sorprendio ya que le dije que eso puede afecta y darme una menopausia prematura y por ende tendría que tomar pastillas por el resto de mi vida por mis hormonas y estrógeno, y su respuesta fue tan absurda, que me dijo que NO, no se, si ella en realidad pensaba que era una persona ignorante o no se que pensar de esa Ginecóloga, ya que además me dijo que mi operación iba hacer como una cesaría, simplemente salí corriendo de su consulta sin programar ninguna visita por el resto de mi vida.
Comencé a investigar y a buscar por una segunda opinión y me encontré con el Dr. Willian Parker, ley su página web, ley los comentarios sobre las cirugías que el ya había realizado y como el promulga la cirugía por laparoscopia, cirugía menos invasiba y riesgosa como lo es una histerectomía parcial o completa.
Mi consulta fue el Lunes 18 de marzo; cuando fuimos a la consulta del Dr. Parker, me sorprendieron mucho, ya que me la dieron rápido, obvio que envíe copia de mi ultrasonido; el día de mi consulta el me dio mucha seguridad, ya que me informó detalladamente sobre mi caso, sobre mi fibroma, como tamaño, además me dijo que no son malignos, me detallo sobre el procedimiento iba a utilizar, como iba hacer mi cirugía, el tiempo, y además me ofreció de primera instancia la cirugía por laparoscopia pesar del tamaño de mi fibroma y localización; con mi Esposos nos sentimos con el muy confiables y seguros, nos dio tanta seguridad, que ese mismo día programamos mi cirugía.
Mi cirugía la realizamos el 26 de abril del 2019, sin ninguna complicación, salí al día siguiente de mi cirugía porque no vivo en San Diego, sino en Prunedale California, mi recuperación fue rápida con dolores duré aproximadamente 4 días, solo tome por 3 días las pastillas para el dolor, me cuide tal cual me recomendó el Doctor Parker, ahora 26 de Mayo me siento muy bien sin ningún tipo de dolor pélvico, espalda o calambre en la pierna.
Además quiero agradecer mucho a su Asistente Griselda, un amor de persona, ya que ella fue quien me ayudó con todo.
El Dr. Parker es el mejor Médico Ginecólogo cirujano para operar vía laparoscopia los fibromas, y por lo poco que lo pude tratar es una execente persona, te brinda tanta seguridad y confianza que te dejas a primera instancia en sus manos.
Que Dios siempre me lo bendiga Doctor Willian Parker. "

He and his team are the best I have ever come across: kind, compassionate, caring and Dr. Parker is highly skilled in what he does. He was able to remove a 25x20x7cm fibroid laparoscopically for me and it has truly changed my life! I thought I should only ever have surgery if it was life threatening... it turns out the positive outcome of this operation, while my fibroid wasn't life threatening, has changed my life so much (it's only been 3 weeks.) A huge weight has been lifted, not only physically but an energetically and emotionally. I cannot recommend him highly enough. Yes, pick up the phone and make an appointment.

2,Dr. William Parker,La Jolla,California, Gynecologists (OBGYN) , Male,197,4.89,2019-05-06T03:26:41.018Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr.Parker is the most gifted surgeon when it comes to removing Fibroids . I am beyond grateful to have found him and to have him as my surgeon to remove my Fibroids.
My journey with fibroids started two years ago when I felt bloated ,tired and looked pregnant . After an ultrasound I found out that I have fibroids (a word I had never heard before) After doing extensive research online I decided to have UFE procedure as I never had the heavy bleeding and my periods were normal.
This is where it all went south. After waking up from that procedure I was told that I have an additional blood flow coming from my right ovaries feeding the fibroids and that I would have to redo the procedure again. (This was terrible news).Then within a few days after having UFE (my first surgery ever) I started having massive kidney pains along with abdominal pains, resulting into a 5 day hospital stay. Doctors were unable to figure out why I was having these issues . After that I went to see a urologist that did many tests and said I have hydronephrosis of the right kidney and massive scar tissue. Long story short I had to have a stent put in 3 different times over a 7 month period , surgery to help resolve this issue and I was in and out of the hospital 6 times. I was heart broken having gone in for a simple procedure to help with fibroids and then having major kidney issues as a result . After all this I still had my fibroids and they were growing.
I went to 4 other doctors before finding Dr. Parker all of which said different things. Most had advised that I needed a total hysterectomy and would have to be cut open and left with a big scar as this would be a complicated surgery. I was scared to go through all this and was worried that once again I would have complications. Doing more extensive research I came across Dr.Parkers website and started having hope again after reading through many reviews.
At my first visit with Dr. Parker my worries were put at ease. We went over my MRI extensively (which no other doctor had done with me) he answered all of my questions taking his time and he told me he can remove my fibroids laparoscopically and recovery would be about 2 weeks. This sounded fantastic and I was immediately interested in doing this surgery . He did not rush into it like the other doctors and advised me we need to wait until my kidney heals completely and then we can go forward. Once that happened we moved forward. The day of surgery I was very nervous but Dr. Parker assured me that all will be ok and I felt at ease hearing that. After surgery was over I felt better than I thought I would . Dr. Parker removed several large fibroids the biggest being over 9 cm. I had a bit of pain for about 2 days and then immediately started feeling better each day. It has been several weeks now since my surgery and I have more energy, my bulging stomach has gone down, my scars are tiny and are healing very nicely and I fell better then I have in years. Dr. Parker is the best surgeon in this field and I highly recommend him over anyone else. He is so gifted and is also a very warm and personable doctor. Thanks to Dr.Parker I can now move forward without having to worry about fibroids and take my life back again.

3,Dr. William Parker,La Jolla,California, Gynecologists (OBGYN) , Male,197,4.89,2019-03-28T16:25:11.037Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Maria A.C. (Lima Peru)
Just twentytwo days after my laparoscopic myomectomy (March 6th 2019 )with Dr. Bill Parker, I feel strong and recovered and am feeling grateful and blessed to have had the best doctor and his wonderful team give me back comfort and feeling healthy again. As many of his previous patients have commented it was exactly the same for me, two gynecologists in Peru, where I live most of the year, had assured me my only option to remove my fibroids would be a hysterectomy. One of them said I no longer needed to keep my uterus anyway since I have my three children and no longer plan to be pregnant. I have friends that have recently trusted such advice and had hysterectomies for different, mostly non health threatening problems, and they are shocked at the immediate changes they have felt in their bodies. Hormonal changes and physical discomforts they had not been warned about. A few are quite upset about it and never expected such a big change.
Knowing this and having done my own research I was convinced that unless there is a real reason that outweighs keeping your uterus intact these doctors were not giving me the advice I needed.
Before deciding on surgery I had two appointments with Dr Parker, because one of my options was to just wait, since both my doctors in Peru and Dr Parker assured me the fibroids were no serious risk to my health, and that after menopause they most likely would begin to shrink naturally, but I have not started menopause and I didn’t want it to get worse before it got better, my fibroids were growing, I had three considerably sized ones and multiple smaller fibroids, the largest being over 8cms. It made me feel as if I was 5 months pregnant constantly, my stomach looked a little pregnant all
the time and the pressure on my bladder was very annoying and interfered with my daily life. There were moments where the pressure made it difficult to relieve my bladder and it was very uncomfortable and worrying to think it might become bad enough that I would need to have a catheter inserted, as one of my friends had needed done during a trip and that had led to her having a hysterectomy immediately after.
Deciding to have surgery for a non major health reason is not an easy decision and I had doubts and concerns, but meeting Dr Parker and talking to him really gave me the confidence to decide that this is what I wanted to do.
I could not be happier with the decision. A total of five fibroids were removed, including the three large ones. And apart from the comfort of not having that pressure on my bladder, feeling lighter and fitter again, I appreciate having my stomach looking flatter and feeling comfortable in my clothes, the sutures were always surprisingly small and nicely done. The largest incision worried me aesthetically for the first 10 days but I was so happy with the comforts and result of my surgery that it seemed a very reasonable consequence that I was happy to accept, but by now even that minimum swelling and unevenness has gone down and the skin on that area looks smooth and even, I know the redness will fade slowly but already looks good.
I am already recommending Dr. Parker to friends and family, I feel
I was wise and fortunate to find him, his team is also wonderful
and helpful and pre op and post op care and procedures were of the highest standard. Felt safe, cared for and protected throughout the entire process.
Thank you Dr Parker!

I found out I had fibroids 8 months before I got surgery. I live in Ventura County and I went to 3 different doctors locally and they all wanted to perform a hysterectomy. I did my research and I found Dr. Parker and I am so happy I did. He said I don't have get my uterus removed we could just remove the fibroids. I was so relieved this was an option for me since no other doctor gave me this option. He has a wonderful bedside manner and an excellent surgeon. I am still healing but it has been a wonderful experience. Dr. Parker and his staff are friendly, kind, professional, and super attentive to all your needs. I feel like I got my life back since surgery. "

He and his staff are very knowledgable, informative, and simply awesome. My experience with Dr. Parker and his office was amazing from consultation until post op.
If you're in the market for fibroid removal, I highly recommend this consummate professional. He was truly a Blessing to me and I urge any and everyone dealing with this situation to seek him out if at all possible."
6,Dr. William Parker,La Jolla,California, Gynecologists (OBGYN) , Male,197,4.89,2019-01-28T18:49:11.296Z,4.8,4,5,5,5,"Dr. Parker is one of the finest surgeons I have ever met. He recently performed a laparoscopic myomectomy for a 6 cm adenomyoma. Two and a half weeks out I am back to my regular routine and feeling fantastic. Having the tumor removed was a major life priority. Seeing Dr. Parker was one of the best decisions I have ever made. I wish I had made that decision much earlier. I cannot overemphasize the critical position Dr. Parker occupies in the treatment of uterine tumors (fibroids and adenomyoma) in America.
My story of how I came to him is unfortunately typical for many women. After a lifetime of regular periods, I began having very heaving bleeding in 2014. I didn't understand what was happening to my body. I resented having to carry pads with me everywhere. I bled randomly. This greatly exacerbated the regular stress I felt at work. The first doctors I saw only ordered ultrasounds. They said I had one larger fibroid and two small ones. Because I was not inclined to have children, one doctor offered up hysterectomy as a panacea. He would remove the uterus and cervix through the vagina. No more bleeding, no chance of cervical cancer. All problems solved he said. But I was still in my mid-thirties and felt strongly against hysterectomy because I believed it would affect my body in very negative ways and harm the pleasure I felt during sex. That doctor suggested a Mirena IUD. The IUD could eliminate all bleeding.
Fast forward to 2018. I was having constant light bleeding. Because my ""fibroid"" was submucosal it appeared to me I might be a good candidate for hysteroscopic myomectomy. I found a random gynecologist in the Phoenix area and asked her about this procedure. It seemed like a perfect solution. No abdominal incisions. Quick recovery. I asked her if I was a good candidate. She said yes and we scheduled the surgery. I asked if she wanted to see an MRI I had from 2016. She said it wasn't necessary. That should have been my first clue this wasn't a great idea. But the equipment manufacturer material made it sound like this procedure was a piece of cake. I woke up from surgery with the surgeon telling me she wasn't able to remove any part of the fibroid. The IUD was still in place. There had been a great deal of blood. She was afraid she'd punctured the uterus so she aborted the hysteroscopic myomectomy and performed an exploratory laparoscopic procedure to check for uterine damage. There I was in August 2018. Fibroid still in my body and possible pneumonia from my time in the hospital. In my post-op with her, she said she would have chosen hysterectomy for me, not hysteroscopic myomectomy. I had first learned of Dr. Parker in 2015. At this point in August 2018, I knew he was my only and best option. I had my Arizona surgeon order a pelvic MRI and mailed it off to Dr. Parker's office at UCSD.
I met with Dr. Parker after he reviewed the MRI images. He spent a great deal of time with me and explained what he saw in the MRI images. He was fun to talk with. It's clear that Dr. Parker takes the symptoms of fibroids very seriously. He truly cares about his patients and the psychological pain symptomatic fibroids cause. Dr. Parker, based on my symptoms and our long discussion, recommended ""watchful waiting"". Interestingly Dr. Parker said I was not a good candidate for hysteroscopic myomectomy given the location of the fibroid far in the back of the uterus. His recommended surgical option was laparoscopic myomectomy. I told him I'd think about it. After talking with my husband, we decided to go ahead with surgery. I wanted to be done with this long nightmare. Dr. Parker was key to helping me end that nightmare. Thank you Dr. Parker!!!"""
7,Dr. William Parker,La Jolla,California, Gynecologists (OBGYN) , Male,197,4.89,2019-01-15T19:27:43.722Z,5,5,5,5,5,"After living with a large fibroid for more than 2 years I finally found my way to Dr. William Parker. My fibroid had grown over the course of three years from 4cm to a whopping 13cm and although I tried every natural remedy under the sun including cleanses nothing was helping. I finally had to come to terms with either leaving it and waiting for menopause to shrink it or to have it removed. I chose not to do embolization because I don’t want the MRI dye in me for a second. And that wouldn’t have actually gotten rid of it anyway, it would only have shrunk it and even that wasn’t guaranteed. I saw 4 other OBGYNs over the last two years. Three of them said hysterectomy was likely and that I’d need to consent to that prior to surgery in case they felt it necessary once they were ‘in there’. One of them was even an Ayurvedically-aimed doctor. I was not feeling this at all. I found an OBGYN in La Quinta who referred me to Dr. William Parker. She said, if anyone can get this out, it’s Dr. Parker. I consulted my IVF doctor in Beverly Hills who said the exact same thing. My husband and I met with Dr. Parker and as quickly as I said ‘no way!’ to the other three doctors after meeting them, my husband and I said, ‘Yes. He’s our guy.’ You see, you either trust someone as a PERSON or you don’t. And THEN you can go and look up their professional reviews and records. Dr. Parker lay out the options and wasn’t trying to push any of them. And one option that was very much an option was to not do anything because menopause for me would be arriving in the next five years most likely.
Well, I decided to do the myomecmtomy. Laproscopically. I was concerned about the scars because I’m self-conscious and live in California so I wear bikinis often. I decided that I should be mature about it and choose the option that was the safest and had the faster recovery time AND no overnight hospital stay. So that was my decision. We don’t live in San Diego. We live 2.5hrs away. So we arranged our pre-op to be the day before the day-surgery. Stayed at Torrey Pines Resort for 2 nights. I think it was Dr. Parker’s nurse Griselda who suggested we stay over the night after the surgery. Smart move. I was in at 9am and out by 6pm and went back to the hotel and slept. Up the next day and back home by 1pm. No fancy painkillers needed, Advil was all I took. I also used a thing called a Bemer Mat which I think significantly sped up my recovery. I was told by Dr. Parker two weeks later I was good to go and resume regular activity. I still took it easy but I was able to walk right away. I would recommend a week off and lots of rest and reflection. This is an emotional surgery. Lots of gunk gets stored in those fibroids of ours!!
I am very glad I got to meet a doctor who one of the good ones. No nonsense, caring and does it because he loves what he does. If you have a fibroid and are thinking about it - I HIGHLY urge you to at least get a consult with Dr. Parker before he retires! Seriously. He’s not going to be doing this forever. I’m feel extremely fortunate that I was somehow led to him. I really wouldn’t have let any of the others touch me. You MUST trust your doctor implicitly when they are going into you.
Best of luck to you. Drink lots of lemon water and lay off sugar, alcohol, caffeine before and after surgery (for a month if possible) to help you heal even better.

8,Dr. William Parker,La Jolla,California, Gynecologists (OBGYN) , Male,197,4.89,2018-12-13T08:19:39.477Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Seven months ago due to lower back pain, abdominal bloating, pressure and pelvic pain, I decided to see a gynecologist in Los Angeles, and I was advised me to get an ultrasound​. After the ultrasound, I was told that I had three fibroid tumors. The gynecologist in question did not explain to me that fibroids are often benign, and I felt depressed and scared because I am still young and I would like to have children one day. After having researched about fibroids online, I learned that I do not have cancer, and ​they are often removed using laparoscopic myomectomy. I asked the doctor if she could remove them using laparoscopic myomectomy, and I was told that in my case it was not feasible to perform such a procedure due to the location of the fibroids, which would make them hard to remove using this procedure. However, I was not comfortable with the idea of having surgery because surgery would cause a large incision, and it was too invasive. Therefore, I decided to obtain a second opinion, and I began to search for a doctor who has extensive experience in the removal of fibroids. After having researched and called many doctors, I finally found a gynecologist in San Diego, and it was at that time that I found Dr. Parker. Through his website, I discovered a gamut of information regarding fibroids and how to treat them. His website was extremely informative, and after I met with Dr. Parker, he explained in detail how he could remove the fibroids using laparoscopy, which not only made me confident and comfortable​ but it made me feel safe. Dr. Parker talked me through the procedure and explained every detail to me so that I would feel comfortable, and he made sure that all of my questions were answered. My experience with Dr. Parker was extremely positive because he did not treat me like a number. I did not feel rushed. In fact, he even put me on his priority list due to my short time stay in the United States. After the procedure, I stayed one night at the hospital because I do not live in San Diego, and I had driven from Los Angeles to have the procedure done. The following day, I received a call from Dr. Parker. He wanted to find out how I was feeling, and on the follow-up​ appointment, he prepared a surgical report and pictures for me to take home in case I needed to see another doctor in Saudi Arabia. Now I am six weeks post-op from the laparoscopic myomectomy, and I feel great. All of the problems that I had experienced before the surgery are gone. I am very happy with the results and I only have small scars, which are not noticeable. I do not have large incisions on my abdomen. Dr. Parker is not only extremely knowledgeable, but he is kind and professional. He is an extraordinary physician and his staff provided me with the best care. I could not have asked for a better outcome and Dr. Parker went beyond my expectations in regards to care. He is one of the most caring and compassionate doctors that I have ever met, and I am blessed to have had him as my doctor. I am forever grateful. Thank you, Dr. Parker."
9,Dr. William Parker,La Jolla,California, Gynecologists (OBGYN) , Male,197,4.89,2018-11-19T20:49:51.886Z,5,5,5,5,5,"I started this review on the 18th of Nov. 2018 but mistakenly posted the introductory part due to the touch screen of my computer . The review deserved to be published in full as an act of testimony from my family and other families out there that might need Dr.. William H. Parker's excellent service.
We visited five medical doctors (OBGYN and Oncologist) and there nurses whom I rebuked to touch my wife with their pessimistic diagnosis. ""I am going to remove your Uterus"" , said by the doctor and my wife responded , ""can you keep my fallopian tube""? And the doctor said, ""everything is going to come out, it is a pregnant uterus"". Their champion slogan is to remove the uterus as soon as possible, that it is likely to be cancerous due to its size - what a myth! I could see the spirit of fear creeping into my wife and her life began to diminish during the awful bargain. What do you expect from a good country lady, who is faithful and spent most of her life in charity works for the lord and just got married. I rose my head up, stood for my dear wife, rebuked and debunked them on every occasion in order to detoxify the psychological poison deposited in her by their wrong diagnosis . I told my wife that God has not given His own diagnosis . We got our knees on prayer and worship . It was a real battle. What supposed to be a honey moon became a six months of staying at home without working but praying and searching through internet , to see if their is another opinion out there. Miraculously , we found fibroidsecondopinion.com after five doctors opinions.
Dr. William H. Parker is called by God . An authority with passion not only on female Uterus and Vital organs conservative but also for the entire well- being of his patients. He took the almighty coat of medicine and laid it down in front of his table and took a passionate coat of love and care and puts it upon every individual that visits him in his office. It was exactly what happened to my wife who had a fibroid tumor that looks like a nine months pregnancy.
""I am going to offer you abdominal myomectomy"" said by Dr. William Parker and my wife joyfully said, ""thank you Sir, thank you Sir"" as life came back to her. I believe strongly that with the Lord , you can make the best deal in every registers of this life . You have to be optimistic and strong in your Faith that balances with prayer while diligently searching for second opinion . Dr. William H. Parker is a treasure that is deserved to be searched for. He is the best among equals.
My wife is now wonderful in her spirit, gorgeous on her shape after an abdominal myomectomy in which a ten pounds weight of a fibroid that stalked on her uterus was removed, together with two to three tiny fibroids inside her uterus. The surgery was done on late march 2018 by Dr. William Parker and his best team in medicine. The nurses, front desk personnel , cleaners and Food Services department were all amazing . She was discharged at the 3rd day . Though we came from Texas but we stayed in the hotel nearby and the stiches were removed a week after the surgery and we flew back to Texas next day - what a miracle!
Watch out! Uterine monster (fibroid) , we are after you. Though you have spread your ugly tentacles of fear, pain, discomfort and shame to our dear sisters , wives and moms with your so called threats of destroying their divine organs and wrecking their families. I tell you this, your days are numbered at the hands of fibroidsecondopinion - Dr. William H. Parker.
Surely, we are going to pay visits to those pessimistic doctors. This time around, it is not going to be rebuking and debunking but peacefully and gently passing the flyers to them about fibroidsecondopinion.com . I believe that they are smart enough to take my offer so that both of us will be on the conservative side of life.
Spreading good news about fibroidsecondopinion will now be part of our missionary work.
Hi Prof. , I am still in search of journals that will contain your divine works in medicine. You are a genius of our generation and generation to come.
We love you so much.
Love and Dan. Houston TX.

While my twins had to be suddenly delivered via a c-section at 33 weeks, he made sure that both I and the twins were always cared. He even visited my twins at the NICU until they were released. If you are pregnant and in the Los Angeles area, do everything you can to make sure that he is your doctor."

20,Dr. Steve YU,Los Angeles,California, Gynecologists (OBGYN) , Male,58,4.41,2019-05-31T17:25:39.281Z,1,1,1,1,1,"I hate to leave such a harsh review, but after a lot of debate, I would strongly advise any woman to seek another doctor within the UCLA network. If you message me privately, I will refer the other doctor I had to go after Steve Yu.
I was recommended by a friend to see Steve Yu. It was a horrible and very expensive mistake. The nature of my periods changed recently, and Steve Yu suggested I had fibroids. We had an ultrasound, and then he mentioned I needed to get surgery.
He said I needed to get an MRI ASAP with UCLA which cost an estimate of ($5000).
When I tried to ask more questions he mentioned I needed surgery ASAP, without seeing an MRI or the details on my condition. HE GAVE ONLY ONE OPTION - SURGERY!
I went to see another doctor at UCLA, he mentioned that my condition was not bad, and I definitely did not need to get surgery. This is unfortunate because under Steve Yu's direction I already got a rather expensive MRI. My new doctor stated it was not needed and that 70% of women have fibroids, and not all 70% of them had to get surgery.
Steve didn't give any other options besides surgery, the new doctor gave a list of options to help, and listened to my concerns. He also mentioned that my MRI was not necessary. One thing I appreciated about my new doctor was that he was honest, he mentioned if I wanted to get the surgery I could, but it was not a need. He also mentioned that this type of specific surgery was not his strong point, but was happy to point me to a doctor that would be excellent with this surgery. (In comparison to Steven Yu, my doctor was very honest about what I needed and even recommended options that wouldn't benefit him).
It is rather unfortunate that in today's day a doctor will pick fattening his pockets instead of selecting the best option for a patient. Upon my research and the second opinion of the other doctor, it did seem that Steve Yu's recommendation of surgery as my ONLY option was not in my best interest.
Again, I hate to leave such a harsh review.....please seek other options. I would hate for any other woman to have a similar and expensive mistake.

He spent no longer than 5 minutes with me. Did not answer any of my questions and rushed with my appointment. I left the office having a lot of questions unanswered and I did not get a chance to ask them. My medical chart said that I was due to other tests and he did not even bring them up. Really dissapointing. UCLA really should look better at their doctors...

I had an established doctor in my home town, but never felt confident that my diagnosis was completely correct and my options were never explored. I learned more from Dr. Yu in one examination and visit, followed by imaging to confirm his diagnosis than more than two years at my local dr. He diagnosed me with Adenomyosis, and Fibroids, confirmed it with imaging and then gave me his professional opinion - although he specializes in alternatives to hysterectomies for fibroid tumors, my best possible outcome would come with having one. I completely trusted his opinion as he had proven to my husband and I that I was not a ""number"" to him, but an individual with a unique situation. I had my hysterectomy on February 11, 2019. He, his staff and the entire UCLA team were amazing. I cannot say enough good or recommend him any higher. "

Twenty-four hours after my laparoscopic hysterectomy from Dr. Yu, I was able to work on a book I'm writing and two days later, I was able to go shopping at the mall with a wheelchair. A few days later I was able to take an international flight.
I just want to share with women like me who have very large fibroids, to know that they don't have to go through surgery with large incisions, a long recovery, and much pain when there is an alternative.
Dr. Yu is the best and his team is excellent. I was so comfortable, treated with warm friendliness. I felt like I was among my family rather than a stranger patient.
I'm sleeping and eating well, taking short walks with my husband beside me for safety, and have no serious pain less than a week after the surgery.
I highly recommend Dr. Yu and UCLA health for this kind of procedure.

I have Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) which can be challenging from all the co-morbidities. He was patient and really took the time to make sure everything would go smoothly. Dr Yu & his surgical team took almost 45 minutes before my surgery so nothing would go wrong. I have great confidence in Dr Yu & highly recommend this wonderfully caring & knowledgeable practice. I'd also say he is wonderful for anyone with EDS seeking an Ob-gyn. I have had horrid experiences in the past & finally found the rare gem.

He's professional, a good listener, experienced and well-trained on the latest medical techniques. I saw him for a second opinion, and it was the best decision I ever made. The first doctor I saw recommended a hysterectomy. Dr. Yu explained that a hysterectomy was not necessary, and he successfully removed 14 huge fibroids with laparoscopic surgery. My uterus is intact, and I only have two tiny scars on my belly instead of a huge c-section scar! I couldn't be happier with my results. His nursing staff at UCLA is also AMAZING AND KIND, and the surgical hospital was so clean, you could eat off the floor. I fully trust and highly recommend him!!"

I double checked after using it for one day and his response was to continue using as discussed. This caused a chemical burn and allergic reaction after a couple days of use. When I emailed him to explain the new issues I was having he said to stop using hibiclens and contact a surgeon if i continue having problems, not even willing to correct the issues he caused with having a patient do something that was unsafe. SO UNHAPPY WITH HIS RESPONSE AND INITIAL CARE INSTRUCTIONS. Do not see this doctor if you care about your hooha."

During the initial evaluation, he took the time to clearly describe the procedure and encouraged questions and dialogue. His manner is kind, self-assured and open. He demonstrated clear knowledge regarding the procedure which was very reassuring. I was scheduled for surgery in an expeditious manner and he was at the hospital to check in with me prior to surgery as well as afterwards. He presents with excellent bedside manner and has a warm and caring approach. Importantly, the surgery went smoothly and I was back at work in less than week post operation. Two weeks later, it is hard to tell where the 4 small incisions were made and I feel great! I strongly recommend Dr. Yu to anyone who is considering this type of surgery. "

I can not rate Dr Yu highly enough. From a personal perspective, he was extremely communicative, reaching out to call me as soon as he had any results. He took the time to explain everything that I needed to know in a calm and thorough manner. I never felt rushed, and always felt he was happy to answer any and all questions. Additionally, I believe he has a great deal of respect for women. He had a healthy respect for a women's ovaries, likening removal of them to removing a man's testicles. Between this conversation and the tests that he performed, I had confidence that the likelihood of any unforeseen changes to my surgical plan were minimal. In addition both the office staff and his assistants were friendly, thoughtful and always helpful.
My surgery was done at the SM Outpatient Surgical Center, a newly built location across from SM UCLA. The surgery went well and I returned home the next morning. My recovery went as expected. I had one question a few days later, and Dr Yu returned my call the same day. I have just gone in for my post op appointment, and everything looks great! "

It's clear that my health and the health of our baby was always her top priority. Working with Dr. K is a collaboration in healthcare, she is patient, attentive, and supportive.
When our son was measuring small for his gestational age, she recommended induction and it was 100% the right decision. I was worried before each intervention, but I felt safe knowing they were recommended and monitored by Dr. K. Even though induction was not what I wanted, I had a 10 out of 10 birth experience thanks to Dr. Kumetz.
Her team is amazing too. Marlyn, Flora, and Joanne continue to support me past delivery and postpartum. Some may scoff at the fact there is an annual administrative fee, but I would choose Dr. Kumetz in a heartbeat as our OBGYN if we become pregnant again in the future."

I thought she was really great. I asked her if I could get a pregnancy test done, as I felt that I was with child. I was not going to keep the child, as I wanted to terminate the pregnancy.
When she told me I was pregnant, she was very jubilant and happy, and wanted to schedule me for all my tests. I had to interrupt her, to explain it was an unwanted pregnancy. Her tone changed abruptly, and she curtly mentioned she could do the termination. In each appointment, she continued to try to avoid the paperwork, and conversation.
She didn't really want me to have it, and that's fine. She's allowed her opinion. But to give me the runaround consistently, instead of just being honest and telling me she didn't want to give me an abortion would have been preferred. I ended up going somewhere else, which was fine. I think she would be excellent for women deciding to have babies, as she is knowledgable, kind, and loves delivering babies.
I just think her lack of professionalism was very telling."

I agree wholeheartedly. She is patient and caring, listens carefully and welcomes feedback about her office staff, office services and procedures she performs at outside surgical facilities. Dr. Kumetz strikes me as being extremely knowledgeable about her speciality and conservative about only ordering tests, medications and procedures necessary for optimal patient care. She obviously loves her work and has great compassion for her patients. I am in menopause and was a little hesitant to see a young GYN, wondering if she would understand or be interested in me. She has been fabulous from day one, put me at ease immediately and makes me feel as important as her younger OB patients. I am very happy that I found Dr. Kumetz and recommend her highly."

This is my mothers second time having breast cancer and he performed a procedure to remove her ovaries. Following the surgery he never reported to my family or my mother anything about the procedure nor did he pass the information on to anyone else to relay. After having the nurse try to contact him for over two hours, I finally received a call back from him. His attitude was the most egregious, condescending belittling tone that I have ever felt with. After asking him why no one had contacted me after I was promised a call even from the initial cut and him responding, "" I've never met you, and didn't even know you existed,"" I was floored! Along with him insisting that I needed to try and find the nurse that had my number and ask her why she didn't pass my information on and how he didn't use the same system as the other employees that work at UCLA , I was baffled. The fact that a doctor that just performed a surgery didn't feel the need to inform the family of the outcome is unbelievable. With this being my mothers forth procedure this year this is defiantly not my first time In a waiting room and I have alway had great doctors who communicated more than enough to make me feel comfortable. After dealing with Dr. James Heaps and his lack of communication or empathy I never want to return to Westwood UCLA. Santa Monica has a much more friendly and better bed sued man jot than Dr. Heaps could ever display! The fact that he repeatedly stated that he has been here 30 Years was even more irritating, because that means that he has no leadership skills or order in his team, and the lack of communication is unheard of!"

But Dr. Heaps is above all THE BEST DOCTOR! Very caring, he listens to your questions and answers them in a very through way. He treats you as a whole being. He understands your health and emotional needs while you go thru difficult times. Also, he considers the impact of the diagnosis on the other family members. He is very honest and he is very pedagogical when explaining your health issues. He colleagues call him “angel hands”. He did two surgeries on me and I healed so quickly, I was up and running if half of the recovery time. I would recommend his practice 100%. The employees are also incredible.

He is also misinformed about which birth control pills (BCP) are best for each individual and highly recommends BCPs that are known for having severe side effects like blood clots in the legs. He was not very proactive in researching the causes of symptoms and was content to agree with a previous doctor's diagnosis, without reading a report, testing, or consulting with the previous doctor. Disappointing, as these good reviews presented him as THE doctor to see. Wait time for appointment is long (2 months+), and parking is $11, no validation offered."

He spends quality time with his patients. He will answer any question (no matter how silly you think it is) and he returns calls personally. They don't make doctors like him anymore. He genuinely cares about his patients and is extremely professional with a great sense of humor. I brought my 16-year old niece to him for her first OB/GYN visit and he spent over an hour with us in a comprehensive consultation and he made her feel comfortable and helped ease her fear about this first visit. His staff treated her with the utmost respect and kindness too. I can't say enough good things about Dr. Mandel and his staff. They are fantastic.

His level of knowledge allows for him to maintain calm in all situations. I was diagnosed early (and by another doctor) as a high-risk pregnancy and, as one might imagine, this caused me a great deal of anxiety and I was full of questions. There was nothing that Dr. Wyatt wasn't prepared to answer and, further, his demeanor and knowledge assuaged my worries each time. I loved that Dr. Wyatt came and remained in the delivery room with me for several hours as, luck would have it, I did end up having a complication during labor that I'm certain a less experienced doctor would have been ill-equipped to handle. Dr. Wyatt made sure that I did not know about the complication to diminish my fear in the moment, but was quick to get the nurses ready to allow for a successful and quick delivery (without even a stitch necessary!) I ended up with a very healthy baby girl! I shopped around for an OB this time (2nd pregnancy) and am so happy to have found Dr. Wyatt!"

In that time, he has delivered my two children, helped to ease my mind after dealing with preeclampsia with my second. He cares. He's there. I know some would complain about his appointments running on time, but I can appreciate that usually it is due to him needing to be there for a patient with an emergency earlier in the day, or another patient that has more questions he very respectfully answers. I've been one of those emergent patients. I have been one to have a lot of questions about procedures, and prognosis. There is NO ONE I would rather have as a doctor than him. His bedside manner is compassionate and kind. It says something when the nurses at Cedars look forward to working with him, and see him as respectful and kind even to them which isn't what many would say about some other doctors working at Cedars who talk down to the nurses and patients.
Dr. Banooni is knowledgable in all things related to fertility. He is up on the latest research related to the field. I don't mind that I drive nearly an hour to see him. He is worth it. "

I have NEVER met a doctor who has such a gentle and patient bedside manner. He is friendly and funny and always makes me feel at ease. I was blessed to have him deliver my 2 girls. He very recently has helped me get through my 3rd pregnancy, which sadly ended in a miscarriage. He never brushed aside my pain but truly cared. Regardless of living about 40 minutes away from his office, I will never change doctors."

He's always available to his OB patients when they're delivering, and knowing he was going to be there was so comforting as an expecting mom. He calls back, he answers questions fully, and he is very personable and human at each visit. Definitely put me at ease when I was worrying unecessarily. I would recommend to a friend."

I had a very difficult pregnancy - was in the office every week. I was incredibly ill the entire duration of the pregnancy and I had contractions for months before the baby was due and was constantly in and out of the ER. Dr Banooni was ALWAYS on call. He took my calls, listened to my concerns and always made me feel like I was a priority. He always stayed in contact with the ER, at all hours of the night and he ALWAYS called me back, EVEN WHEN HE WAS OUT OF TOWN ON VACATION! I understand that he is sometimes late for my non-OB appointments, but after going through a pregnancy with him I am understanding as to why. He is hands down the BEST doctor you could ever have if you are having a baby!!!"

He delivered both of my children, helped me through a miscarriage, and I'm starting on my 4th pregnancy, 3rd child. I honestly don't know what I would do if it weren't for Dr. Banooni. He's extremely caring, understanding, professional and knowledgeable without being intimidating or ""holier than thou"" like way too many doctor's I've seen. He answers all my questions, and my appointments never feel rushed, even when he has a baby to go deliver. There are times when the wait times are fairly long. But considering the patients I see going in and out of that office who are there for JUST Dr. Banooni, and the fact that part of his job IS delivering babies which, after delivering two, I know is ALWAYS unpredictable, I understand. It's the price you pay to see such a wonderful, dedicated doctor."

He's reassuring without being cavalier, which is something that I find very important in a doctor. His wealth of knowledge is extensive, and his bedside manner is terrific. (I am one of those women that screams and yells during labor, and he took it all in stride!) Unlike many other obstetricians, Dr. Banooni is ALWAYS on call , so you never have to worry about another doctor showing up at the hospital when you're in labor. Dr. Banooni WILL be there -- ( even at 3:00 am, EVEN when he has an early surgery scheduled later that day!) He is also excellent at returning his pages in a timely fashion. While my experience with Dr. Banooni was during a normal pregnancy, I've spoken with other women in his waiting room who have seen him for other issues, and, they also think he's wonderful."

He spoke to me very disrespectfully because I screamed during the birth of my child. I guess I must be the only woman he ever delivered who screamed while she was pushing her baby out. I think he realized he was out of line because afterwards he said to me ""oh I didn't mean that"" but he didn't say ""I'm sorry"". In the end I am just grateful to have a healthy baby but the way he spoke to me was inappropriate, especially since I had no pain medications for the birth.. He is a qualified doctor but he needs to work on his temper."

I feel very lucky to have him and that he delivered 4 of my kids. He SAVED my LIFE with my last pregnancy - I developed a sudden complication at birth of my last kid. Yes, he is handsome and caring. It is unfortunate that he got caught with one patient the way he did. He is a nice guy. Professionally, he is superb. Caring, empathetic, compassionate, knowledgeable. I've always recommended him and will do. He helped me through a tough decade. His humor lifted me like no other anti-depression drug would have. I trust him with my life.

He delivered both of my children (1998 and 2002) and both times, he was extremely professional and caring. Dr. Fischbein is the ""tell it like it is"" type. And if you can't appreciate it, then maybe he's not the doctor for you. But I appreciated his frankness when I overreacted about symptoms of pregnancy. EVERYONE has had a lapse in judgment at one time or another. He's not a deviant. He is an excellent doctor and a good person. I would still recommend him to anyone who needs a great OB."

I was check into the hospital 12 hours ago before push , was not emergency at all, i believed she was informed , so i really don't understand why Dr.B decide to not coming in time ?
During the pregnancy , few appointments , Dr.B was not shows up for me , I understand she must busy with deliver babies or emergencies , so i just let nurse to check baby's heart beats, that's it .

She has very excellent knowledge and explain everything in detail and answer our questions with smile! We found all the people in her office are very kind and helpful! We waited not more than 20 min, unless Dr. Boyer is in the delivery room or seeing some emergency cases. We use to take our first Daughter with us for my wife's appointment during her second pregnancy and Dr. Boyer enjoyed talking to her. Dr. Boyer gave us an atmosphere that we are seeing our family member every time we went to her. I think it is really hard to find such a top rated Doctor with all good qualities!

Worst doctor I've come across - I had been in labor for about 7 hours and was pushing and was told Dr Boyer was coming from her Palisades home. I was crowning and the nurse had to put 2 fingers out to stop the baby from being delivered - all this while Dr.Boyer, who was being kept abreast of my situation, decided to take all that time to come. She did not congratulate nor look at me once when she finally did arrive to deliver the child. She may be knowledgeable but what's the use of all that brain if there's no compassion in your service."

She has delivered something like 9000 babies and has seen it all. Her personality can be quirky which I appreciate. She rarely sleeps as she delivers all of her patients and still manages to make it to the majority of her appts in the office. My advice: schedule the early appts so you don't have to wait long. Her main nurse knows more than most doctors. You can email her nurse with any questions and she replies the same day. I stayed in LA only so I can deliver my 2nd baby with her. These women are amazing and Dr. B does the best C section incisions you have ever seen. If you can get in with her, don't think twice!!"

Being a high risk doctor, she's done it all. She can be rushed at times, but I personally think it's because she has so many patients, so many births and so little time. I don't blame her. And if it were me in Labor, I sure hope she'd be late to her other appointments. :) As for bedside manner, I think she's great. I have no complaints and I've had SOOOOO many different Dr.s in this field the past 20 years. Now, since I will be having my second child with Dr. Boyer we'll see how that birth goes. But I'm pretty sure, considering I met with 3 other doctors before I picked her, that it's going to go as planned."

We were confident going into deliver about Dr. Boyer's capabilities and bed-side manner. However, three hours into active labour and heavy pushing, Dr. Boyer still did not appear at the bed side. She refused to leave her scheduled check-ups. Her resident asked her to come many times, but was repulsed each time. It turns out that our baby was occipital posterior (face up) and had his head cocked to one side. This made passing his head very difficult. Apparantly, Dr. Boyer was aware of this fact and chose to keep it from us. After almost three hours of pushing with no progress, the Resident made one more attempt to get Dr. Boyer's attention. Dr. Boyer refused again and suggested that my wife ""stop pushing"" and wait for her. After three hours, that was absurd and incomprehensible to me! Only after my wife demanded that the resident deliver the baby did Dr. Boyer come rushing in."

I liked his friendly manner. Other than that I wish I hadn't trusted his advice. I only have one ovary and rather than tell me that I have a limited amount of eggs and should consider getting pregnant sooner than later. He continually assured me that his wife had their first child at 45 yrs. of age and there was no rush. At 35 after never getting pregnant I went to a fertility specialist and he said my FSH was the level of a 90 yr old woman. He was appalled that Dr. W was telling me that I had plenty if time to get pregnant. Weinberger never once mentioned estrogen level was abnormally low for my age. The fertility specialist wouldn't even accept me as a candidate for fertility treatment. Half the time he would tell me my urine sample looked fine when i didn't even leave one. Needless to say, I will never recommend Dr Weinberger to anyone."

Fifteen years ago, my primary care physician -- and I use that term loosely -- called to tell me that my most recent mammogram looked normal, and while admitting there was initially ""some concern"" on the part of the radiologist about my left breast, he assured me that no further action was necessary. By the grace of God, I told the primary to forward my film to my OB/GYN, Dr. Weinberger. The very next day I got a call from Dr. Weinberger saying, and I quote, ""You need to see a surgeon asap, honey."" Shortly thereafter, I received life-saving surgery for what turned out to be early-stage breast cancer. Had I not insisted that my film be forwarded to Dr. Weinberger, my cancer would have gone undiagnosed, possibly until it was too late, and I would not be here today writing this review. He is the best. Accept no substitutes."

Over seven years without my cyle I went to obgyn after obgyn who told me each and every one that I went through menopause as well as a host of other problems including in two cases, cancer, (I was 30yrs old at the time of my first doctors visit in which I recieved this info) and that due to this I obviously could not have another child, which was devastating to me. Then, seven years in and absolutely crestfallen, my friend suggested I see Dr. Weinberger and said if ANYONE could help me, it would be him. Well, after two quick visits, Dr. Weinberger informed me that I had indeed NOT gone through menopause and might still yet get my period, but either way I COULD have a baby with hormones. 3 days later I got my cycle + continue to this day. In addition, Dr. Weinberger has the lovliest bedside manner. Because of him I am pregnant today!"

He is a kind man and a knowledgable man and he delivered my child. He is currently helping me through menopause. I am always wary of negative comments in these forums... I have a friend who also went to Dr. Weinberger and she ""fired"" him after he refused to accomodate her in some of her pregnancy requests. I know my friend and she is an unreasonable pain in the ass. She fires all her doctors eventually because she has such ridiculous expectations and has a huge sense of entitlement.

This was my wife's second (and last) pregnancy. Both were high risk and while the results with Kaiser, who was our previous medical provider, were good in that she and our first son left the hospital in good health, Dr. Tabsh's care was head and shoulders above. The man is an eminent expert in this field and the reasons for the long waits are due to the fact that exclusively treats high risk pregnancies. He is not a social butterfly, but neither my wife nor I were looking for a party planner. We wanted the best care for her and our unborn son and that is exactly what we received. Moreover, the criticisms I'm reading about his communication style are unwarranted. Like I said, it is true that he is not going to talk your ear off, but he will answer any and all questions posed to him and he will tell you if the baby is doing well or not. If you want to converse, talk to your friends. If you want your baby and the baby's mother to live, see Dr. Tabsh!"

He misdiagnosed my pregnancy, sent me for numerous unnecessary tests, caused me unnecessary stress on myself and my baby and cost me lots of extra money for nothing. He does not communicate well, the wait time to see him is hours (even with an appointment). Luckily, I went for a second opinion and received a proper diagnosis and proper care for my pregnancy elsewhere. I feel it is time for him to retire."

I had a high risk pregnancy and had to see Dr Tabsh regularly 1st and 2nd trimester and then every other week 3rd trimester. talk about a lot of waiting room time! but so worth it. He is brilliant. Who cares if he doesn't make small talk? It is because he is concentrating on the baby and pregnancy people! I would much rather be in excellent hands and skip the small talk. Anyhow, I actually got to know him a little better as I was there so much and contrary to many comments below - he is an absolute teddy bear - the SWEETEST man. He just has a lot of patients and gets the job done then moves on. I had a very healthy baby - all thanks to his great care. I actually did have an amnio done by him - he took great care in trying to make me comfortable. It wasnt so bad (just some light cramping). Love this doctor and would use him again if needed. he is brilliant. love his staff too!"

He didn't talk to us at all the first visit! We go no pictures and we had no idea if our baby was ok - he wouldn't answer any questions. We had a 3 1/2 hour wait. The second ultrasound we had a 4 1/2 hour wait and he was still very rude. We asked to find out the sex and he wouldn't tell us until my husband became clearly upset. He didn't speak this ultrasound either. I asked for pictures this time and he said why? What a difficult doctor - I hope I don';t ever have to see him again! Other people have given him good reviews and I clearly can't figure out why. He's rude, doesn't speak much. wont answer questions, and has NO redeaming qualities! His nurse is nice but the check in staff are also rude and are NEVER there at the window to ask questions, We had a terrible experience!"

My baby is the best thing that ever happened to me and I'm grateful that he is healthy. However, because of Dr. Tabsh ,his birth was the worst day of my life .He has way too many patients and you may fall through the cracks as I did .I found him to be focused only on the baby 's well being and not mine. You may be injured in the birth process ,as I was, and find that he does not care. He does not tell you what is going on at any stage of the pregnancy or during labor and delivery. I heard that he had a "" bad bedside manner"" but that does not describe him well. I would describe him as cruel. I know that he is smart and that he has many articles published and many people love him. I went to him because of this and it was one of the worst decisions of my life. I hope that I can help someone out there by letting them know that while he is great for some ,he was devastating for me."

After my first baby I developed high blood pressure and will soon be 36. I was told that I am a high-risk patient at this point and need to see a specialist. I wanted to see Dr. Tabish so that he could advise me before I get pregnant as to how to have the best pregnancy possible. For example, change blood pressure meds. I was referred by a friend who had Dr. Tabish deliver her baby. I find it really disappointing that I cannot even get an appointment to see him. I was given no explanation as to why. I called to request this and the person I spoke to said she didn't know why, he just ticked a box saying NO. I don't think this is the correct way to deal with potential patients and if this is the kind of attention they give I am happy that I am not a patient. I would have felt very secure to be in Dr. Tabish's care during my pregnancy. I would recommend that people look else where for a doctor since this is how he treats people."

I also found her wonderful, kind, and knowledgeable. I remember liking her staff, especially the younger girls who were close to my age, but, it was about ten years ago so maybe her staff has changed. On my second pregnancy I did not have insurance. She gave me a very reasonable rate for all the check-ups and delivery and got us a flat rate for the hospital as well. I would not hesitate to recommend her and she is truly what I miss now that I had to switch from Blue Shield PPO to Kaiser."

She seems nice at first, but question her a question and she gets extremely defensive. Also a C-Section doctor so beware. I switched to a different doctor because when I asked her why I needed a C Section she had the nerve to say to me ""Do you want your baby to die!""

She is exactly what I had been looking for - a smart, informed ob/gyn with an open mind and positive outlook. She was my ob during my fantastic pregnancy, which I credit her with helping me achieve.

Dr. Lem is approachable, and direct in regards to his thoughts on your health and how to make it better. During my pregnancy, he was not afraid to tell me when I was gaining too much weight, and helped keep me in check. afterwards. Helped open my eyes to understand that I wasn't eating for 2 adults. Thank god he did, because it was much easier for shed the baby weight. Baby was healthy and delivery was easy."

I can say without a doubt that if it wasn't for him I would be dead. He is the most thorough doctor I have ever seen. When I leave his office I feel as though I just took a class on my own body. The wait can be a bit long sometimes, but it's well worth it knowing that when your turn comes you're going to leave that office with answers to questions you didn't even know you had. He's the go to doctor. Wish more were like him."

H'es so down to earth, very honest, and direct. if he commented about the woman's weight it must've been for a reason. like we all know being overweight is not healthy specially if you're pregnant. he watched my weight so close through out both of my pregnancies. Dr. Lem has delivered both of my boys with c-sections and there's no other Dr. I would trust but him. and yeah he usually doesnt tend to wear a medical robe, but come on its 2011 we're not in the 1940's. and if the man was napping in his office, so what, he gets tired too and wrks on call 24 hrs any day of the week. give him a break those are just bad speculations to base a whole life time career over those things. he's great period"

First of all she is my first female OB, for some reason I have always had males and wow what a different approach. To have someone relate you on so many levels, as a woman, as a mother, etc. It was refreshing. She NEVER ever rushes me. If we spend 5 minutes and thats all I need thats what we do. If we spend 30 minutes, never do I feel like I am getting short changed like I have in the past with other doctors. Every question gets answered in a way that I understand it best. If I don't grasp something, she will explain it in other ways. She is great at giving you options and facts about your vbac questions. I had a successful vbac a few days ago and it was the best experience of my life. Thank you Dr. Valenton for making it possible"

195,Dr. Scott P Serden,Los Angeles,California, Gynecologists (OBGYN) , Male,6,4.25,2017-07-27T08:43:47.163Z,1.5,1,1,2,2,"Dr. Serden nearly killed me 15 years ago when he left a piece of placenta in me after delivering my child.
I knew something wasn't right after delivering my child. I wasn't healing the way that I had with my previous delivery. I kept on calling his office to seek help, and was disregarded. Once I developed a fever, the dr. covering for him because he was away, took me in and checked me. The man felt my uterus, and the pain nearly made me jump to the roof. He should have done an ultrasound right then and there, but he didn't. He said he would give me an antibiotic. That night, while at home, I started hemorraging. It was awfully terrifying. Blood could not be contained, so I called Dr. Serden, and he responded by telling me that it was almost midnight, and that what did I expect him to do at that moment...he was almost yelling at me. I had no time to argue. I was loosing blood fast. My husband was afraid that if he called 911, I would not make it, so he carried me to the car and drove me to the ER. Thank G' for the Tarzana Hospital Staff because they worked hard and stopped the bleeding. They were insisting that I call Dr. Serden. That this was a serious medical emergency. I begged and pleaded that I didn't want to wake him up because he was mad earlier when I woke him up. The ER staff reluctantly agreed. They did an ultrasound and found that he had left a piece of placenta inside. Just for this, a medicine student would fail his medical exam. You never leave a piece of placenta. You make sure you check that it all comes out. It's a deadly mistake. In any case, they released me in the morning and made me promise that I would go see Dr. Serden as soon as his office would open. I did as I was told. Dr. Serden decided to try and remove the placenta with some tools without any anesthesia. That was extremely insensitive on his part. I was completely infected, after having delivered my baby 10 days prior to this ordeal, so the pain was intolerable. He kept on trying to take out the piece of the placenta with different thongs and instruments, and every time the pain was the worse torture I can describe. Once he finally was able to pull the piece out, I started hemorrhaging profusely and he could not stop the bleeding and the humongous blood clots that were coming out of me. They were like jelly bouncing off the table and onto the floor. he kept on pushing on my abdomen and the blood clots would keep them coming. It was like a horror movie. In the meantime, the nurse started laughing with him (I swear to God) because they couldn't clean the blood fast enough. Completely insensitive to me, as I was dying in the table. It was so unprofessional of him to do this in his office, do the danger it posed for me. The craziest part is that his office is at Cedars-Sinai. It would have been very easy for him to just do the right thing and take me to the hospital instead of being lazy and doing it in his office, without any pain medication or anesthesia for me. Going back to the awful description of the day I cannot forget, he started getting frantic because he couldn't stop the bleeding so he started injecting me with methrogen. The block did not stop, blood clots kept on coming. He then called another one of the doctors in the office. Both of them now frantically trying to stop the blood. More injections. In the meantime, my mother who is waiting in the waiting room with my ten day old baby (because I was breast-feeding at the time, and I didn't expect to be almost dying during the appointment) sees people running up and down the hallway and realizes that the emergency her own daughter. She pleads with the doctor to let her in, the doctor refuses, and by the time my mom pushes her way in... I am literally passing out from the blood loss. My mother is slapping me and begging me to stay with her... desperately trying to prevent me from slipping away. It is at that point that the incompetent Dr. Serden finally dials 911, and in just a few minutes about 15 paramedics come into his office and take me via ambulance to the emergency room at Cedars-Sinai which was just another building. These paramedics start me on an IV, they put my feet up on a box so that my vital organs can get the blood left in my body. The whole nightmare is one I will never forget. It took me 15 years to write this review, because the trauma was so unbearable. We are all human, and can make mistakes, but what I cannot forgive is the laughing as I was dying in his office. The fact that I called him when I had an emergency, and he reacted by telling me that it was almost midnight. I didn't choose the time that I was going to hemorrhage. (Due to his mistake). Needless to say, I do not recommend Dr. Serden to anyone ever!!!!!!"

With my last baby, he detected a very serious heart defect at our 20 week ultrasound. He didn't say much about the condition because he is not a cardiologist, but he sent us to the Los Angeles Children Hospital on the next day, where the diagnosis was confirmed. Thanks to him and his team because they took us in charge in this very difficult situation. Then, a few months later, I am pregnant again. I wanted to see him particularly because I know he is actually very competent. He is polite and empathetic. I have seen him for the nuchal translucency test (12 weeks), then he told me he would see me back at 18 weeks, then 21 weeks to make sure everything is ok. I have nothing but good things to say about him, he is professional and very human."

Like the reviewer below me, I find most of the reviews here (understandable) expressions of distressed, disappointed but ultimately unrealistic patients. Silver and bedside manner is refreshing, frank and empathetic. I think the reviewer who was so put off by silvermans joke about her baby's squished face missed the fact that he was trying to help her find a little lightness in a tough situation - as opposed to the opposite."

I find him and the technician to be very personable and have had good experiences with them. Plus they have crackers in their waiting room. :) Some of the reviews on here seem ... misguided. What kind of person cries for an hour because a doctor makes a joke about their frowning baby? And aren't most people already aware of the risk of miscarriage that is associated with CVS (I was)?

Regretfully, we had a miscarriage following our CVS test. This led us to research more information regarding this MD. You will find a lot of negative feedback in the community, especially online. Simply google this for yourself. You will find a website titled “Dr Neil Silverman killed our son”, postings speaking to the number of malpractice suits against Dr. Silverman. I have even seen other grieving mothers simply posting the words- beware and look into his malpractice history. The information is there. Use google. Learn more about the tests before you decide to consent to them. Feedback from UCLA is the Fetal DNA blood test will one day replace the CVS. Most miscarriages are categorized as for “reasons unknown”. What MD is going to admit to their own negligence? They wont. This is your pregnancy and your decision. We suggest you educate yourself and do your research first."

I was there because of my risk of gestational diabetes. After Dr Silverman pointed out how large her stomach was compared with her head I was very concerned as any mother would be. So feeling already a little sensitive he then commented on her face, literally saying ""Ergh! Look at that face, it's all screwed up, she's frowning and all squished in there."" It was the way he said it, rude and demeaning. I wish I could've responded, but I was so hurt and shocked by his comments I was on the verge of tears and could barely keep it together. I cried for a good 45 minutes after seeing him. No mother to be should have to hear that kind of comment. Especially from a so called professional!"

In all, he is a very sympathetic doctor and THAT is the most refreshing of all because I have seen 3 obgyn's before him and they were all just out to make dollars. They could care less how I felt. All they did is treat me like I was a guinea pig! Dr. K informed me of what I was to expect. He was candid and straight forward about my results and objective about the plan of action.

It was the most disgusting ""medical office"" I have ever seem. It was not in a medical center like I assumed. There were clothing shop & liquid mart right next door. The office was dirty & it didn't seem equipped. There was no actual nurse & anesthesiologist there. To perform a general anesthesia, you need a licensed anesthesiologist. The frontoffice staff wanted to change me $100 co-pay for emergency Medi-Cal. However, my case worker told me there were NO such fee. I have to put her on the phone to talk to the front desk staff. After they realized, they were wrong about ""co-pay"", I talked to the office manager. She then told me it was to pay for the pain med& the anesthesia during the surgery. I feel they were trying to scam me into paying them extra money,& the office was super disgusting. So I left. I called Family Planning Associates & made an appointment with them the following week.So ladies, please don't make the same mistake I made by going there."

The only good thing about this office is they get you in quickly. But they tried to charge me a $100 copay when I qualified for medi cal. They are not HIPA compliant. The office is dirty. One of the younger girls at the front desk was playing on her cell phone, feet up on her chair, while I stood there waiting for somebody to help me. Another woman was talking on her cell phone and didn't stop to help me. A third was standing there going through files, didn't even look up at me. I would NEVER use this office for anything again. In fact, I left without finishing my appointment."

I have been told so many times about how it would take a miracle, well, I think I found one, Dr. Aliabadi.
Since she is also a surgeon,, I did not have to be farmed out to yet another doctor to address my underlying issue, which no other doctor thought was the cause. Well it was, she was right and now, thanks to her, I have a family and no time to sleep anymore! :)

Just have lots of sex and you will be fine"" SHE IS VERY IGNORANT of health conditions and downright rude. Her office furniture is fancy but she hurt me so much i was in pain for weeks after seeing her. She gave me terrible advice as well.

After a while, around my 5th month or so, I endured terrible pain of purib separation of pregnancy, i tried to tell her this symptoms, and seek for advice to relieve it, she gave the explanation of ""it is what it is, sometimes we just don't know why some women has it"". I personally allergic to some seafood, and always have bad short breath that i genuinely can't sleep at night, i was not sure if it'll have anything risky if i want to use epidural, i raise the concern, hoping she can tell me what the risk mitigation plan, and what might be the symptoms if i m allergic to epidural.

When my old OBGYN left to go to Kaiser (I do not have Kaiser Ins) I had to find a new one. I looked online & kept finding great things about Dr. Dwight (who works in the same office as Dr. Y). I had originally scheduled an appointment w/ Dr. Dwight but came down with a terrible yeast infection before my appointment & called the office again to see if they could squeeze me in that day. They said they had space open with Dr. Yamaguchi & I am SO glad they did! I prefer a female doctor & she shares all the same philosophies as Dr. Dwight in terms of natural childbirth, etc. You won't find a lot about her yet on the various rating websites, but that is just because she is new to the practice.

She is young and energetic but don't let that fool you. She is also very experienced and knowledgeable. She delivered my first child and she was so patient with me and listened and repsected my wishes to not be induced synthetically. In the end, I opted to be induced because I wasn't making any progress on dilation but the point is she waited without rushing me to get induced. Same thing when it was time for me to push. I was pushing for almost three hours and she didn't push for a c-section. She was very encouraging and gave me good directions/advice while I pushed. I gave birth to a healthy boy vaginally thanks to her! Thank you Dr. Yamaguchi! Only downside is the wait and the staff are sometimes slow to get back to you."

On numerous occasions, I have gotten checked in and changed into a robe and and end up sitting in the examination room for a lengthy time, while Dr. Poladian is not even in the office yet. This is not the worst of it. I was billed twice for the same thing and overbilled at that. But the worst of all is when I received a bill that should have been paid by my insurance company.

He didn't question my desire for a more permanent form of BC, and respected my decisions to go with an IUD.

I wanted to avoid a section and when things went badly he had a very ""see, I told you so"" attitude. I ended up getting a nasty infection and my incision burst open when he tried to remove the staples a week after surgery; it took seven weeks of home health care to recover from that experience.

During a followup conversation on phone, seemed preoccupied. I asked if he had my chart in front of him.He admitted he didn't. I felt I could have been anybody. His pelvic exams (I've had 2 with him) are very much more rushed than with my prior gyns."

A Must See Doctor!!! -"

She takes time with patients and knows her stuff. I have not had surgery yet but feel like I will be in knowledgeable and compassionate hands. I have been very nervous in the past dealing with doctors and female issue but from the day I first walked into her office I felt very comfortable. I only wish I had gone to her from the beginning.

He is extemely knowledgable and helpful in every way. He takes a personal interest in every patient and he is very respectful of your opinion and the choices you make for yourself as a patient. I have never felt rushed during a visit and Dr. Kline is always willing to answer as many questions as you may have. In my mind, he is exactly what I want in a doctor."

He is such a nice and caring doctor, but most important he is smart! He truly studys the facts, his follow up is excellent. Thanks to him our family is complete. After seeing many doctors who seemed to run up a bill and filling my body with hormones, shots and unnecessary tests for more than 9 years. I began to see him and 1 year later at 41 years old I had my baby girl!!!"
283,Dr. David Klein,Los Angeles,California, Gynecologists (OBGYN) , Male,4,5,2006-08-04T16:24:05Z,5,,5,5,5,"He is an AMAZING doctor. I have been a patient for 10 years and see him as a primary doctor and not just for OBGYN issues as it is so difficult to find someone of his caliber. I have to disagree with the comment about his bedside manner and while he's not necessarily chatty, he is personable and kind. He is very caring and concerned and is better than any doctor I've known about returning phone calls promptly and being generally responsive. He is always willing to listen and feels than any concern is valid to consider if a patient is concerned enough to bring it up. He always listens thoughtfully and responds interactively/conversationally rather than talking at you as some doctors do. He never makes you feel like your concerns are trivial even though they might be - he treats patients like equals and with respect. I give him the highest marks and we should have more doctors like him with their hearts in the right place."
284,Dr. David Klein,Los Angeles,California, Gynecologists (OBGYN) , Male,4,5,2005-08-07T09:36:06Z,5,,5,5,5,"This is a great doctor, but don't expect huge things in the bedside manner department. He's super knowledgable and is quick to tell you not to worry if you do something that you're worried about while you're pregnant, for instance. He's a calming influence. On the other hand, he's ALL business. Not a lot of chitchat. Not a lot of conversation. Nice, but not gregarious."

I have struggled with pelvic pain and infertility for the past year due to a large tumor. I've been to drs who have scared me to death and then I was thankfully referred to Dr G. She made me laugh when so many others made me cry, gave me hope when I felt hopeless and eased my fears. She has one of the kindest bedside manners and is really funny. I needed her in my life and I'm so glad I found her to care for my unique needs! She's just wonderful. I felt at ease but also really felt like she cared and was extremely thorough in answering all my questions. She knows her stuff! "

Each reviewer gives her work five stars. This fact should make you wonder about her competence. She has a SUPERIOR attitude. I recall that after she performed surgery on my sister, Bess, many years ago, I went to Cedars Sinai Medical Center to see my sibling, and this so-called ""physician"" completely ignored me. I felt like I was invisible. She simply never acknowledged my existence. My sister was very ill, so her offensive and hurtful behavior toward me was enhanced. She is a real b####! She is bereft of empathy, the essential ingredient that creates stellar doctors."

Except during my baby-years (she was no long delivering and recommended a great baby-doctor). As a surgeon there is no one like her. She goes beyond anything required to make you feel and know that your health is her first priority. I don't look for a friend in a doctor, I look for a professional who can save my life in surgery. Perhaps the posters who are seeking friendships should call their friends before visiting their doctors. I went back to her after my last child was born, and really appreciate her medical expertise."

In normal times and in times of medical emergencies, I have found her to be at the top of her game professionally, warm, patient, a good listener, and unrushed during my time with her. She also explains all available options, and treats me with great respect. I have 4 or 5 friends who are also patients, and I know they agree completely with me."

She may be well-regarded in her field, but she has always had a horrible bedside manner and been cold and callous. Until recently, I accepted that fact. However, this week, I have attempted numerous times to speak with her on the phone to discuss a concern. Each time,she has been too busy to be responsive, even going so far as to get on the phone only to tell me in a very rude and inappropriate manner that she cannot speak because she ""could not leave patients waiting."" Her nurse proceeded to tell me that she has had a full day of appointments and has a ""personal appointment"" this afternoon so will not call back for 3 days. Mind you, she also had a ""personal appointment"" yesterday afternoon when I called. The behavior of this doctor is inconceivable; she thinks only her time is valuable. I highly discourage any woman from going to this doctor. Interacting with her is a profoundly unpleasant experience."

From the very beginning, my one and only visit to this so-called professional was a nightmare. Her staff was indifferent almost flippant when I came in for my appointment. When I went in to meet with Reichman I sat in her office and she began to ask me several questions about my medical history (which I know is normal). Her demeanor was pretentious and bored. Basically, she did not wish to be there working. She had an air of holier-than-thou which was very off-putting.Reichman is a very bitter, unprofessional woman who was obvioulsy unhappy with her life because of her hate for life.This visit was 5-6 years ago and to this day,I remember her callous disposition.I am glad that there are now ways to share my story so that others can make an informative choice on whether to select her as their gynecologist or not.I have seen,I am not the first to notice her negative behavior."

The diagnosis to my medical issue was simple and yet missed. I went back 3 times (and paid all 3 times) for the same issue but left feeling dismissed and with no solution to my condition. I do agree that she has a rather cold beside manner.

I was told by another doctor that if you ever have a serious female health problem, that you would be lucky to have Dr. Reichman as your doctor. She has an abrupt, cold bedside manner, but is an outstanding doctor who is recognized internationally. A friend of mine went to her for a fibroid, and Dr. Reichman, instead of scheduling surgery weeks in advance, actually cancelled all her appointments for the day, and immediately drove over to Cedar's Sinai to perform surgery. I'm a firm believer that in the end, bedside manner is far less important than having the best doctor in her field. I can't recommend her highly enough."

I mainly had one of his staff doing my ultrasound, her name was Stephanie and while I’m sure she does her job well in a technical sense, she lacked bedside manner. She was very robotic and hardly acknowledged me as a person. Also there was very little talking and no explaination of anything which was so off-outing. Even something as simple as how are you feeling today? Are you excited to see the baby? She barely said hi. "

But it is crucial that the baby be in the right position, and that he can see everything he needs to see. So I appreciated that I got a great look at my baby, and a DVD of the whole ultrasound. I've seen the list of Dr. Platt's work, and it's clear that he is primarily a researcher and lecturer. I feel very lucky to have gotten a clean bill of health from someone who is so trusted in this field."

He and his staff have always been helpful and easy to be around in every way. When issues have come up he has been right on top of it with my GYN.

He has misdiagnosed me and 4 of my friends and we all have healthy beautiful children. Upon telling me my first child had downs he suggested a CVS and an abortion right away... I can't imagine if I had done that... my son is beyond perfect!! And chromosomally healthy! Run away... see Dr. Samadi. He is awesome and caring.

Dr. Diego who up until this point had always said we were friends, never came to see what had happened. After this awful ordeal she promised to deliver my fourth baby to make up for the trauma I had to endure and even said she was willing to go to another hospital to make it happen. Now I am pregnant with my fourth child (she is no longer an OB) and when I called to try to get to see her for confirmation of my pregnancy and the length of gestation it seemed my friend was no longer a friend but a stranger. I have never been so hurt by someone who claimed frienship for so long just to find out that to her I was nothing but dollar sign and this sign no longer thickened her wallet.

She is a specialist in vulvodynia yet uses her patients for studies just to enhance her portfolio of crappy conducted studies with little to no actual help to those suffering from this condition. She made me go through a horribly conducted study of hers which involve painful injections. The injections were inserted by her colleague who did SUCH A MESSY and terrible job (he's like a 99 year old dr). They did nothing to improve my condition. She called to checkup on me ONLY for her study and i said im still suffering she didn't care in the least and said oh ok thanks BYE.

In addition to a medical condition, I also met with her to address bio-identical HR and I again like what she had to say and what she prescribed. Can't comment on her follow up as I only met with her today. Hope this is helpful."

Dr. Rapkin has done two surgeries for me and both times were a good experience and she is always there to talk to you afterwards.

I am a younger patient who has been suffering from very severe pelvic pain and has tried many medications, biofeedback, -EVERYTHING. I thought I had seen the worst of the medical community-until Dr. Rapkin. She blew into the exam room like a hurricane, distracted & VOLATILE. As soon as she saw I was younger & decent looking-the HATE began. She actually said ""You're pretty, you don't look sick to me...You should be happy you don't look sick"" Really? I cry in pain every night, hurt all day, haven't been able to be intimate in six years. I swell, cramp, pee like I'm 90 yrs old but I look okay so I should be happy?? She basically just yelled at me for looking okay the entire visit then accosted me during the most painful pelvic exam I have ever had! After all of this she offered me NOOO-zilch-options! She said do yoga. I TEACH YOGA. She is cold, rank, arrogant & inefficient. Save yourself heartache --go somewhere else! Even the PT & nurse were TERRIFIED of her."

She called me after my pap smear to inform me that I must right away make an appointment with her office because she needs to see me and monitor me by doing more test to make sure that I have no cervical cancer.
She told me that the test result came back and it showed that I had Genital infection HPV (cause of cervical cancer). She told me that it is very important that I see you right away.
I was shuck since I was not sexually involved with anyone for the past several years.
As well my annual pap smear was always satisfactory and HPV 16 and 18 test (cause of cervical cancer) done with my pap smear was always not detected and negative.
When I questioned her she got nervous and started screaming that that it is very important that I see you right away.
After, I hang up the phone with Dr. Taz Elizabeth Varkey, I called her office and asked her staff to fax me a copy of my test result. My pap smear was satisfactory and HPV 16 and HPV 18 result was not detected and negative.
She is a con art-ist that would do anything that is possible to make more money.

When I told Dr. Varkey is was impossible that I could have herpes she didn't consider the fact that the accurate herpes test (which the lab also pulled) showed as being NEGATIVE. She went SOLELY on the ImG test results and basically just wrote me a prescription for Valtrex and got off the phone. She is a TOTAL hack.

Dr. Varkey was reccomended by my internist but she refused to do an ultrasound on me even though I continually complained about pain. I sought a second opinion and the new ob-gyns referred me to an ultrasound that found an extremely large ovarian cyst. I lost my ovary. I never looked back when I left this over extended practice and Dr. Varkey. Too many patients and perhaps too much effort to accommodate the insurance companies. Also they refer you a lot to the nurse practioner even though you still are charged the saw an obgyn. I would have paid for better care if I could have my ovary back.

The two major complaints I have is for one her staff. Dr. Cohen is extremely busy and she needs more help. Her receptionist is a total bull dog with major attitude that doens't let you speak with the doctor. The receptionist is the one answering phones, answering personal questions which I feel should be answered by a nurse or doctor. I dont like that Dr. Cohen herself does not call you with results, I feel that as a patient you deserve those few moments to discuss results. Although Dr. Cohen has great high level energy I feel the appointments are sometimes rushed. She herself is a wonderful person but dont get on the bad side of her staff"

Her front desk staff acts as a guard screening phonecalls and asking private VJ related questions to anxious patients hoping for a call back. Once you are with Doctor Cohen you are in the most capable hands I know. She is kind and experienced and held all the answers to all of my pregnancy questions. Her billing staff is great as well and will work with you as they only take Anthem Blue Cross or Cash. The secret to getting to speak with the doctor is to call the after hours number or call at lunch. The exchange is much better at giving patients acess to their doctor than her front desk staff... but Doctor Cohen is such a sweetheart! Can't recommend her enough"

She delivered my daughter and it was my first pregnancy. She made me feel comfortable during every visit and came to visit me twice while I was in labor (once was on her lunch break) before I deivered and softly talked me into having an Epi! Which I was totally against. She was so right...I delivered within 45 minutes of the epi after 12 hours of nothing happening. I let her do her job and guide me and it was the best thing I could have ever done. I am going back to her (just found out I am pregnant) and I have moved over 100 miles away!!!!!

I had two miscarriages prior to being under her care and therefore, was ""high risk"" pregnancy with my first and second child, in addition to having thyroid issues. Dr. Lee has a way of making you feel at ease and her nurse Flora is equally calming and helpful. Dr. Lee is a parent herself with young children so she can understand, relate, and be empathetic with her patients. Expect to not be seen for at least 1 hour after you check-in for your appointment. But, this was never a problem for me because Dr. Lee is worth waiting for. Once, you get to see her, she relays takes her time, answers all your questions/concerns, goes over everything with you. In my experience, no other doctor takes this much time with patients. My two boys were born healthy and exactly one day before due date. I truly am so thankful for Dr. Lee and her team, they are amazing and I can't recommend them more.

She was an absolute blessing; she kept our son safe while also respecting our wishes for a natural birth process. I was in labor for 6 days and she really advocated for us with the resident doctors even when she wasn't there - a true gift when it came to dealing with inexperienced, yet eager residents in a sensitive situation! I will also add that she had great bedside manner; made us laugh even in the stressful situation. I wish there were more dr's like her!"

I am goinghome"" and then all grumpy you go In to see an upbeat straight forward asian. A typical Dr. Will do a 10-15 turn and burn and send you on your way. Dr. Lee is well informed, knows the latest pregnancy trends and 45 minutes into your visit you realize ""wow, this Dr. Is exactly what we want"". Here is a woman with two young twins of her own and a husband and still is on call 24 hours a day. This was proven when she showed up at 9:00 on a holiday weekend and stayed over an hour taking care of my wife.

She always spent extra time explaining everything and provided the very best medical care. Because of her I delivered a healthy full term baby. Many Doctors would have blown off my symptoms, but she always took them seriously and because of her dedicated care we were able to stop my preterm labor. Her wait times are insane. I know it is because she spends so much time with every patient, fits everyone in who is worried, and does not leave until she makes sure you are comfortable with your plan of treatment. If you are having complications in your pregnancy that is what you want, so to me the wait was worth it."

She blew through my lunch and I was told I couldn't empty my bladder until after the appointment... Leaving a pregnant woman hungry and needing to pee is a sure fire way to piss her off. Lee knew I was displeased and barely talked to me throughout my appointment, which was the supposedly so-important 'first trimester screening'. She lamely apologized but then blamed the other patients in front of me. The front desk staff, nurses and waiting patients all agreed this is her standard operating procedure. There are many other docs and midwives out there who can be professional and considerate. I'm not wasting my time with Lee."

I've had a rough couple of years gynecologically and she has been a wonderful doctor throughout, also referring me to the right specialists when needed. I definitely felt comfortable talking with her and asking her questions. The office is pleasant and the staff are nice as well. Another big positive is that they have nurses on the staff so you can get your blood drawn right there rather than having to go to another facility and the office is connected to Good Samaritan Hospital. The only downsides are the wait times (which is not unusual for any doctor these days) though the actual appointment is pretty quick and that you will have to pay for parking."

The stuaff and nurses in UCLA med plaza are nice, too. He has a lot of patients and usually his day is fully scheduled; so checking in may take some time because you have to wait for him to finish seeing the previous patient. The only holdback is that my insurance is HSA and I have to pay full amount under $1250, so one annual physical costs me $300+."

I had a normal vaginal beautiful birth with her help. VBAC! So yes you might wait for her because she's willing to take time with her patients when we need it. She waited for me!

He saved my life and I am glad that God put in my path. He is extremely patient and caring and in no way has he ever been disrespectful or unpatient.

The doctor that wanted to do surgery on my fibroids even though I have no problems with them. With Dr. Hernandez, so far I have had two neg. paps and told me that I have mild Dysplacia (the other doctors were very admant that I have my cervix removed) and he feels no need to remove my fibroids. Hopefully I continue to have luck with him. I have had no problems."

He told me that I had ""a very high level of ascites""and that it could indicate that I had cancer. He was rude and condescending and practically screamed at me that not only did I need a hysterectomy, but that I needed to have my ovaries removed too. (female castration). When I went to have the ascites removed and biopsied the paracentesis doctor told me that I had NO ASCITES and therefore he could not remove what wasn't there. I had clearly told Dr. Hernandez that I was NOT interested in hysterectomy. I sent a letter of complaint to California Hospital and a copy of the letter to the Medical Board."

I had a miscarriage and needed to have a DNC and he acted annoyed when I asked him questions and genetic testing as my fertility doctor had instructed. He reminded me that I was 40 and would have had a miscarriage 1/2 the time anyway. Everyone I know that has had a DNC was put into twilight sleep. They gave me demorral(sp?) and I was awake during the procedure, which was exremely unpleasant. Do not go to this doctor unless, for insurance reasons like I had, you HAVE TO."

He's the ONLY Dr. I don't mind seeing. He has excellent bed side manners and takes time to answer all my questions and concerns. He explains everything to me. I have seen other OB/GYN's and I won't go back to them (a few female). We make jokes during the exam. His assistant, Diana is THE BEST!. She makes me feel at ease every time I've been there. I have recommended several friends and they have had only positive experiences with Dr. Ewertz. The only negative experience I had with him was that he didn't deliver all my kids. Wait time? The very few times I've had to wait is because people show up late, causing the back up. Another time, someone went into labor; not his fault. I didn't select an insurance company as it has changed for the three pregnancies. He has even tried to get me into a mammogram screening."

He spent very little time with me, but then it wasn-t an issue. Then I was trying to get pregnant for a while, and wanted a consultation to that regard. I waited 45 minutes, to see him look at his watch 3 minutes into the consultation. He treated my questions as idiotic, told me I was past ""my fertility curve"" (I'm 34), and I should have had children in my 20's. He did recommend my husband have a sperm analysis. We received results at home, which were abnormal, but we didn't really understand them. Ewertz NEVER called back to interpret the results. Not once. A nurse finally spoke to me telling me a wrong diagnosis and told me to go see a urologist. Unacceptable behavior, terrible bedside manner, no psychology whatsoever, makes you feel like he wants to get you out of there as soon as he possibly can. I'm changing doctor."

Although it's been over 17 years since he did my emergency c-section, I still have nightmares about it. It was very late at night (early a.m.) on a holiday and his demeanor spoke loudly that he did not want to be there. I felt the incision and the pain was nearly unbearable. The anesthesiologist kept saying ""wait"" to the doc but he went ahead anyway. Medically, waiting the appropriate time for the full effects of the epidural to kick in would not have been taking any chance with my baby. And, his bedside manner was beyond horrible. I sent letters to the appropriate people (at the hospital, AMA, etc.) regarding my experience so that this incident would be on file somewhere. Since there were no ""damages"" (my son thankfully was and is healthy), a lawsuit was out of the question. Beware!!"

Thorough, not so much. My breast exam consisted of checking each side briefly and that was that; he did not check under my arms nor did he have me raise my arms above my head for a second angle. Totally disappointed and won't go back. It's been over 3 years since my last pap, but he didn't seem concerned by that enough to take the time to do a proper breast exam."

He was wonderful my first appointment- so sweet and funny and put me at ease. So I decided to stick with him. seven months later, I have NEVER SEEN HIM again, although I am technically still a patient. I go to his office at least once a month, but I guess he never has time for me because I have only seen his nurse/midwife every other visit. She is kind of cold and is always giving me contradictory information- and expects me to know things about tests and pregnancy without telling them to me. This is my first baby, I am now getting close to delivery, and I don't want some stranger to deliver my child. I am so upset that I have never gotten to see Dr. Noel- even when I came in with severe cramping that might have been a miscarriage. The nurse just told me to go to the ER. Now I have to find someone new, this late in my pregnancy. I'm very upset."

It is against the law to refuse service for not signing the HIPPA form. They have to ask you to sign, they can not MAKE you sign. The three women I encountered in that office are extremely ignorant and over-the-top rude.
When I first got there, my referral had expired. This was because I had an appointment a week before that that the office cancelled because the doctor had an emergency. I don't have a problem with that. We all know this happens with doctors from time to time, but do not treat me like I am some criminal or trying to get away with something when this is just how the system works. I was able to call the insurance company and get an extension which was faxed to them. Still more attitude. ""I don't have a fax. We can't see you without a referral."" No kidding, lady. Give it a minute to come in or look it up on the computer.
The they called me to the desk about the HIPPA form. I never sign them. I don't agree with the policy and I won't give them acknowledgment they can use against me if they make a mistake. Period. They end up sending e to the office manager who is either inept or stupid. I told her to check the law before she sent me away and she said ""I don't need to check the law. The insurance company requires it."" No, actually, they do not. I filed a complaint with them too.
If they do not understand the law enough not to violate my rights, why in the love of christ would i sign a document that states that they ""have explained the law to me""?
They have no idea what they are doing and they are rude when they try.
Go elsewhere.

Waited 2 hours in a Ghetto office. Unless you are a minority having a baby don't bother. He was unprofessional and all about making money on tests I didn't need. Did not understand medical terms I was using. He didn't know I was a Nurse. Told me if I didn't consent to the tests he wanted to give me he wouldn't refer to the Specialist I neede to see and that I was wasting his time. He got paid and he wasted my time. Horrible doctor.

He has always been very interested in what i have to say and always remembers my children, even their names. I think he is a very good Dr. If i do the math I think I was 19 and Dr.P was 40. which makes him about 65 now. so if any one thinks he is moody it might be old age. And him being late to the office well he does deliver babies and babies come at any time of the day or night. I have know Dr. P to work hard and be up for hours. when i went into delivery at 1am on a weekday Dr.P was at the hospital and my first question was dont you ever sleep? cuz i knew he had been at his office all day. lack of sleep can make you moody too.

What I liked about him was that he was always accessible if I had a question. What I didn't like was that he was abrasive when I had questions, negative in his approach to my health, would bring students in during my pap and would not ask my permission and the staff were often times slow to respond to request for paperwork.

He may be moody sometimes, but has never NOT done what is needed. Dr Perat is my families doctor, from my sisters, daughters, cousins and numereous friends. Trust me he has more patients than he can probably handle and that is because he is a fab. Doctor. You know doctors are like finding the right pair of shoes to fit so if you are unhappy then find another Doctor.

Every appointment she was over and hour late. At the later stages of pregnancy that can get very uncomfortable sitting for that long.
She was late to my birth, and after 31 hours of labor the staff told me ""Not to push"" until the doctor arrived. You can imagine my answer. Luckily, she arrived just in time. She also saw that I had eventually asked for Pitosin and an epidural after 24 hours of labor and laughed, ""So much for the birth plan!"" I wanted to punch her.
After the birth, something was wrong. I wasn't healing and the pain got worse and worse. I slept on the couch with my baby because I couldn't make the stairs. Three weeks of calling her office every day and she did not return my call. I eventually went to another OB/GYN who rushed me into surgery telling me my uterus had literally split all the way up. AND DR. JORDAN-HARRIS DID NOT RETURN MY PHONE CALL.
I cannot tell you enough what a nightmare this was--the care was extremely sub-standard and she never cared one bit. This doctor should retire or get her license revoked!"

In hinds sight I dismissed her constant comments as a form of quirkiness. I later realized that her comments convey her judgement of you. When I would inquire where she would make the incision she would often avoid answering the question, and comment, ""You California women"". I later realized she was just condescending. I finally got her to tell me where she would make the incision, she took out measuring tape and stated that she should be able to make a bikini incision. I awake to discover from a student resident (not Dr. Harris herself), that she proceeded to cut me from about two inches above my belly button, the scar curves around my navel and continues to my pelvic bone. He also stated that she did not use a small camera (as discussed) to better assist with the surgery. At my post op. visit she told me to have kids in 2 years and then walked out the office.

Next, I had to have a biopsy, her nurse didnt know what to do and I left crying, feeling violated. Next she called and told me that I had to have laser surgery to remove HPV. I had a bad feeling and consulted a new doctor to discover that I DO NOT HAVE HPV at all! I would have had surgery for no reason!!!...but to fill her pockets with money. I sat in her office crying, asking questions and she could not care less, she told me I needed to read up on HPV if I wanted to learn.

By the 2nd week, I started spotting & itching all over my body in addition to the other effects. I called early one morning to speak with Dr. Harris, as I was worried & ready to quit the ring altogether. I was told to leave a message & that she would get back to me. By the end of the day no call was received; I called back. I was asked to repeat everything again & that she would call me the next day. The 2nd day came & went. My THIRD attempt to reach Dr. Harris I was put on hold for over 10 minutes. When experiencing negative side effects to any medication, this is NOT the manner a patient should be treated.

This was really comforting - especially since she always had a kind word or advise for us.

She truly cares for her patients. I absolutely love her and so glad she is my doctor, I wish I would have known about her for my first baby. Not to mention she has the best office staff as well which makes me extremely happy."

The pap smear was over very quickly, which was great comfort-wise, it's just that I prefer it when doctors spend more time with me. I thought she was very friendly and nice overall though. I would just recommend that she spend a bit more time with her patients."

Basically, I woke up each morning feeling like I had the worst hangover of my life. My only ray of hope, was my monthly visit with Dr Crecelius. I excpected a typical doctor visit with Kaiser- they are so busy, there really is no time to build any sort of relationship with them, and let’s face it, you never know who you are going to get when you make an appointment. I was surprised by not only how caring she was towards my condition, but also her dedication to finding something-anything!-to help me. Every month, she had a new game plan. While it may not seem like a huge deal to someone else, to me, it was the only thing keeping me from continuing on. I thank her for my beautiful and healthy baby boy, she even checked in on me while I was recovering and I am grateful to this day that she kept looking for ways to relieve my misery."

Crecelius,Los Angeles,California, Gynecologists (OBGYN) , Female,2,4.13,2008-02-23T19:23:11Z,3.5,4,5,1,4,"The first thing she said to me (at three months pregnant) was that I would almost certainly have a repeat c-section because second babies are larger than the first, especially if they are boys. She obviously was not supportive of a VBAC. She did not appear to be particularly ""patientcentric"", or willing to deviate from her standard approach. She gave me a print out list of classes we could take, but commented that she'd never taken them, and didn't know if they were any good. Six months later, I had an unmedicated VBAC, with a son nearly a pound lighter than his sister. She may be fine if I had wanted a repeat c-section, but I refused to have any further dealings with her."

She is very polite and caring. If I ever have to wait to see her I dont mind its always worth the wait. Good doctors are hard to find. She treats you like a friend not a patient. She even visited me while I was admitted and helped with my baby. I would definitely use her for my next pregnancy and she highly recommended.

He removed a perfectly HEALTHY OVARY which put me into an overnight menopause.

Told I most likely had ovarian & uterine cancer hidden in 8 endometriomas. She rolled her eyes & would sigh when asked questions, scheduled me for ovarian surgery. Kids would never happen. This is nuts no matter how recommended this woman was, rescheduled the surgery & went for a 2nd opinion. Guess what, I was pregnant & if I had the scheduled surgery this nutbag would have aborted my kid. New doctor, now seen on a national med show these days said ""this is bad medicine"" & ""why do you have a non disclosure from XYZ pharma company in your file?"". Never signed even though I'd been asked directly by Templeman twice. Forgot I'd rescheduled the surgery so when I was contacted to come in for my pre-op appt I said I'd like a call back to tell the doctor I was pregnant. Do you think I ever heard from this woman? NO! Shameful. Today I have the most amazing daughter. Please remember the medical world is big business. Please don't go see this woman."

I use to see her for years until I moved to Washington and she was very attentive and caring. She took a great deal of time with me. She delivered my babies too. So I'm hoping this is not true, but I'm a medical administrator and would sure like to be able to turn this around for her if it was true. The long waits and lack of patient care falls on management as the doctor should be set up for victory and to have time for her patients. Every patient needs to feel great about their service and doctor."

My results have been lost for over a month. I was given the wrong fax # to give to my lab. No calls back to confirm results. The overall service has been poor. This has not been a good experience. My confidence in the Dr. is lost.

I had SottoPelle about 9 months ago with a different Doctor and it worked well. I went to Dr. Jackson about 1 month ago for the same treatment, the results are totally different. I still have hot flashes and I still fell bad. She has made every excuse in the world why this happened. But what's so bad, my girl friend went to her for the same treatment and she has not gotten any positive results either. Don't waste your money or time or health with Dr. Jackson you will regret it."

Having said that - I'm not happy with services provided. I originally went since her practice is at Cedar's Sinai, a very reputable hospital, and assumed that she would be a good doctor. She diagnosed me with a UTI, but I later realized after I left that she and her assistant forgot to take a urine sample (which is basically the only true way to know). I later realized that she was probably wrong in her diagnosis, and I had to go to another doctor. Also, she said that I would receive results back from other samples she took within 3-5 days. 3 weeks later, the lab she hired STILL had no results for me, and I was told - ""didn't they tell you we were backed up?"" I answered no, they did not. The results came back ""inconclusive"", but in my opinion, the lab probably did even not do the test in the proper time to even make a correct analysis."

Dr. Jackson seems like she knows what she's doing and I felt that she was competent, however, I eventually stopped seeing her based on several factors. One, I can't remember ever getting in to see the doctor on time, and sometimes would wait over an hour to see a doctor/nurse practitioner, and the office was so busy that often every seat would be taken, sometimes with pregnant women standing. Two, every time I called, I asked to make an appointment with Dr. Jackson, but all but a couple of times I saw a revolving door of other doctors and nurse practitioners, with no explanation given as to why I wasn't seeing the doctor I made the appointment with. Three, Dr. Jackson never remembered me, even after going to her office for four years. Four, she was very brusque and never spent a lot of time in the exam room. Overall, while I feel that I was provided satisfactory care, I feel that this office should pay more attention to customer service."

Strike 1: In my second visit we were asked to reschedule or wait an hour. We waited 2 hours and when we finally saw her she was rude and didn't answer any of the questions. Instead she sent in Ashley who just confused us and said i was high risk (i am not). On my third visit i waited over an hour in a paper sheet waiting for her to enter the room. Strike 2:Dr. Jackson has given me 3 vaginal ultrasounds due to spotting. In all 3 she has removed the probe cover and placed it in my lap. The third time she did it i asked her not to and she said just to ball it up in the paper gown i was wearing. That is extremely inappropriate considering she has a trash can, that paper sheet is currently being worn by ME, AND i asked her NOT to do it. Strike 3: I had morning sickness and was losing weight. She swore to me the medication she gave me was ""safe"" and was offended that i even asked. I got it and not only was it a CLASS C drug(harm to fetus)but it was also for RECTAL use. RUN!"

The dr. said she was going to conduct a certain number of tests but when I called for results I found out only two of them had been done. In addition it took me multiple tries to get any test results at all. The staff kept putting me on hold and coming back with results from one test but not the other and having to go back to ""check (my) file"". The exam she did was not at all thorough and she seemed to just want to churn through as many patients in one day as possible. All in all the worst gyn experience I've ever had. I am going to repeat my pap with another doctor as I don't trust this doctor or her staff at all. She is a complete waste of time."

I waited well over an hour to be seen. There was only 1 person that had went in before I did and no one else in the waiting room. When I entered the patient area, it looked like some East LA free clinic. When I called to make appts, the staff was rude - got hung up on twice during extended hold periods AND they called me to reschedule an appt 10 minutes before the appt was to occur! the doctor herself was just okay but was extremely rushed during our few minutes together."

She takes her time, and there are no surprises. I love that she explains what she's doing before and while performing each procedure. She's thorough, precise, and I trust her. Not only has she helped me with gyn issues, but other medical concerns as well. She really cares about the whole person! And.. she has a great sense of humor too! which helps me to relax, as I'm always tense when seeing a doctor. She's very easy to talk to, and a great listener. She provides the same excellent service as when I first met her years ago. I've seen other gynecologists in the past, and Dr. Adberg is by far the best!"

God only created one human like her. I thank her for my life and my son's life. And by the way, she is cool and a straight shooter, but above all smart.

He's an older doctor and I found him to be very kind and gentle. He listens to you, and many doctor's don't. It was my first visit and I will most certainly come back. The staff was very nice. I didn't have to wait. But, parking is very very difficult on the street. The doctor's office does not validate. I was there for a little over an hour and it cost me $10 in the building's parking lot. I suggest a morning or late afternoon appointment - times when street parking is more available. Arrive early so that you can look for a spot. Be aware that some of the streets around the office are one-way, so it takes a long time to traverse the area. I gave up after 20 minutes and just parked in the lot. I highly recommend Dr. Robert Pushkin."

Went in hoping to get an IUD because of all the adverse side effects I was having with the pill and she was incredibly knowledgeable about not just every form of birth control but which ones would work for me given my history of migraines and weight gain from the hormones. She thought the best thing for me before I tried an IUD (which is harder to just stop using if it gave me side effects) was the Nuvaring and over a year later I still use it and love it.

As a clinical as well as academic specialist, Dr. Nathan is clearly on the cutting edge of her field, which is why she was able to share with me the most up-to-date treatment approach to my condition. Her clinical manner is exemplary, as she was patient, courteous, and accommodating. Moreover, Dr. Nathan was extremely meticulous in examining my symptoms and extremely detailed in explaining my condition. When I was receiving an ultrasonic test, she was with me in the test room to make sure that I fully understood the process and results. She also discussed with me the advisability of avoiding an unnecessary surgery. Among all the physicians I have seen Dr. Nathan is the only one whom I am more than willing to give a 5-star rating, a top rating she richly deserves. Thank you, Dr. Nathan!"

Had a medical issue and was forced to speak to the receptionist, who wouldn't take a message for a Dr. to call me back and instead relayed ""medical message"" from doctor. Highly unusual and very unacceptable. Requested medical records several times before they were ever sent. Office staff needs to be either re-trained or fired. Highly unprofessional. Takes significantly longer to get a call back than it should and the actual medical advice given is vague. I would strongly advise avoiding this medical practice altogether. Particularly if it's your first pregnancy. It's an assembly-line practice with little apparent care for patients."

Everytime I am there, the wait is an hour until I finally complain and then they take me in. She ordered tons of blood work I did not approve of, which without insurance would have cost me slightly over a thousand dollars. And then she did not even call me to tell me the results, I had to call myself to the lab technician and she told me the results. Afterward, her front office calls and tells me I HAVE to come in for a visit to know my results and when I refuse because I already told them I had called and asked about them already, they attempted to bully me into an appointment by telling me personal information I had told the doctor and ONLY the doctor.

After a nightmarish 4 days with 2 visits to the emergency room and a futile visit to a couldnt-be-bothered urologist for acute urinary retention, I was referred to Dr. Tarnay. I feel so lucky to have encountered Dr. Tarnay. I got an appointment for the very next day. Even though he seemed very busy when I showed up, he saw me on time. He is thoughtful, easy going and confident, and figured out my problem within 2 office visits and fixed it within a few weeks. Everyone at his office is friendly and professional. I highly recommend Dr. Tarnay. My only gripe: The office phone goes directly to voice mail if you call after lunch. Not sure if it's a technical glitch or intentionally set up that way, but it needs to be addressed.
A tip for those who find themselves unable to pee (at all). Go to the emergency room soon. I wasted precious time driving myself to urgent care only to be told by the doctor there that 1)what I needed was a Foley catheter and 2)that it could not be done in urgent care, only in the ER. I had to drive myself home, call 911 to get to the ER, and even though the paramedics got to my house in 5 minutes, by the time my bladder was emptied, it was 2 hours later, and I was in great pain."

This doctor at first appears funny and personable but is extremely outdated and unprofessional. He recommended that I get an open oophrectomy and when I said I wanted a second opinion, got surly. And gave a really rough pelvic exam. When I went to get a second opinion at UCLA with the head of the department there, the UCLA surgeon said to ignore everything this doctor had previously said. I ended up getting a laparoscopy with an excellent surgeon/professor outside UCLA, and I didn't need the absolutely unnecessary oophrectomy. The story doesn't end there. The staff at this office can't deal with billing to save their lives. They're nice but I've had so many wasted hours between calling Quest and Aetna both, only to find out that the office had billed incorrectly. Visit at your own risk.

I am extremely satisfied with the care I received before and during my pregnancy. He always made sure my questions were answered and was even helpful outside of office visits via emails. I felt that I was in good hands all the time. He did not hesitate to contact other specialists when needed. I was impressed when he called me to make sure I knew what was going on while I was under observation at the hospital. He performed my C-section even though it was on a Saturday, and stopped by my hospital room before I returned home. He was also very helpful postpartum when my insurance denied coverage of my birth control and he helped me appeal the decision. In summary, I only have positive things to say about Dr. Lu. In my opinion, he clearly cares about his patients and does more than ""just"" his job. I will continue seeing him and will not hesitate to go back to him for the next pregnancy."

I saw Dr. Lu 5 wk into my pregnancy. He did an ultrasound and saw the gestational and yolk sac. He told me to come back in two weeks for a second ultrasound and we would be able to see the baby and heartbeat. I explained I was nervous with this being my first pregnancy and he told me to come back in a week even though we probably wouldn't see any changes in the u/s. I went back for my second u/s a week later. Dr. Lu saw what we saw the previous week, but this time told me that I had miscarried. I was waiting 20 minutes plus from the time he gave me the diagnosis to the time I was able to ask questions. By the end of my appt I was sked for a D&C the following week. I cancelled the D&C and got a second opinion. I saw the new doctor two weeks after my original u/s. He did another u/s and there was the baby heartbeat and all!"

To make matters worse, he didn't even remember my wife who had been there twice to see him for pre-natal consultation, once for post-natal examination (when he said that everything ""looked perfect"") and then - on her fourth visit when he misdiagnosed her as having miscarried - he actually asked her if it was a planned pregnancy. Dr. Lu is quite literally one of the worst doctors I've ever encountered, and I wouldn't let him deliver a litter of kittens, much less a human baby. It's my sincere hope that the medical board revokes his license to practice medicine before he terminates another planned pregnancy. DO NOT HIRE DR. LU UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES!!!!"

Thankfully my daughter is fine.Dr. Logan never visited me the next day for the exam that new mothers get.She said she would prescribe pain medication for and internal tare from pushing so hard.

In addition, you should note that he has no interest in talking to you nor learning about your medical history.

I said I was in hold for over 30 minutes to now be told you're closed and going to hang up on me, at least you could say you were sorry for having me on hold; he refused. Never ever again.

Is unable to provide basic information and answer question. He is very full of himself and is more interested in talking about himself more then taking care of his patients. He never gave me a chance to ask any questions, always rushing me out even after I waited over an hour to see him. The practice is outdated and there are no nurses on staff. He uses his receptionist who is a medical assistant at best, to supervise his procedures. I don't know how he managed to maintain his medical license for as long as he has but unprofessional people like him should never be Working with pregnant woman or delivering babies. He should have retired long ago, because he obviously hates his profession and only does this to make money, not to help people! I will be contacting the medical board because at his age he is defiantly displaying signs of diminished mental capacity... That is very dangerous and puts his patients In danger!"

However, my experience with him during my pregnancy was unsatisfactory. He is an older doctor, very set in his ways, and while I think he is probably competent, he was very inflexible about anything that wasn't his way of doing things. There were a couple instances of VERY messed up communication. Once I called with a question and instead of answering on the phone, he told me ""come in right away"", and made me come in to tell me in person I was fine, which scared me needlessly (besides, I have a job! and I'm not a child). Then I had an abnormal measurement, and it was like pulling teeth to find out if I needed additional tests. My husband asked again at our last visit, and right after that he sent me a letter telling me he wouldn't treat me any more! Just because we advocated for my proper care. If you are proactive in your care, as you should be, he is not the dr. for you."

At 5 weeks not much shows up, obviously, but since the baby was on it's side she shook her head and said very matter-of-factly the pregnancy probably won't take. What?! Who says that?? No explanation, no sympathy, then she left the room. My whole pregnancy was perfectly fine and she never mentioned that incident or apologized for it. I was naive to stay with her. When I went into labor I asked for an epidural, got one, and only found out later that she ordered the drug to stop way before I got to a 10. I was pushing that stupid button for nothing. No wonder I was in so much pain. She never discussed anything with me or even hinted at that when I discussed pain management options with her. I was in so much pain that I couldn't push effectively and it took 3 hours, and I tore from it. For 3 hours she stood there silently watching me and never said a word. She's a horrible doctor."

She seemed to have very little compassion and concern for my well-being and for my baby's. My labor took 2 days and she didn't show up until the last hour. By that time the baby had been in distress for some time. At the followup, she ignored my concerns about the injuries to my bladder during the birth. She claimed she didn't understand what I was talking about. I left that office in tears. A horrible experience and now my son was just diagnosed with ADHD, probably caused by the lack of oxygen at birth. Every day is a struggle and I curse the day I ever stepped foot in her office.

The office admitted they were wrong, and said they would give me a refund, but never did. They said this many times. Finally I filed a complaint with Blue Cross and they asked the doctor to give me a refund since the doctor was in the wrong. They refused. Blue Cross has decided to refund my money themselves. I also have friends who have had this same exact experience with this doctor's office in the past year.

She was always friendly, usually on-time (w/in 10 minutes), and took the time to double-check minor concerns during my pregnancy. She knew that I did a lot of individual research, and answered questions if I had them. However, if you are the kind of woman who needs/wants a doctor who will walk you through every step of your pregnancy, Dr. L may be too ""hands-off"" for you. For example, we decided to induce when I was 2 weeks past my due date; Dr. L. didn't tell me that inductions are sometimes unsuccessful, so I was totally surprised when I went home after 12 hours of induction/ labor. My pregnancy ultimately resulted in a c-section after 48 hours of labor the following week, and she performed the surgery well. I felt comfortable and in very competent hands with Dr. L, but you must be the type to do your own research."

He talked down to me and my mom and was offended that I had asked him ANY questions at all and then got defensive and shouted his answers back.
He also lied about sending a request to the primary physician’s office for a test. I had to follow up with the primary physician’s office and found out the request was never received.
After the meeting in his office he tossed my mom’s file onto the nurse’s desk without signing and initialing the file.
He is careless and insensitive. I do not know how he can be an OB/GYN caring for women’s sensitive needs when he is such a rude person. I would never recommend this doctor to anyone. I will take my mom to another OB/GYN who’s in her network.

My wife and I expected to be advised of the risks, benefits, and alternatives of our particularly difficult situation. He refused to answer any questions and told us what we would be doing. Appalling in this day and age."

I am now switching though because she has absolutely no idea what she is talking about. I went in for the ultrasound thinking I was about 7 weeks along; so we did the ultrasound and she couldnt find anything but the sac. Her first words were you might have miscarried. ARE YOU KIDDING ME???? First off that is NOT how you broach that subject. Second she instilled no hope in me and when I asked for a blood test she basically said they dont work and that if I was pregnant I was 3-4 weeks. I recieved my HCG levels and was over 12,000 as of last week meaning I am much further along than 4 weeks. She is a blathering idiot. "

590,Dr. Taz E. Varkey,Los Angeles,California, Gynecologists (OBGYN) , Female,1,1,2017-09-12T04:17:49.385Z,1,1,1,1,1,"I am questioning the accuracy of all these positive reviews since Dr. Taz Elizabeth Varkey is a con art-ist. Please stay away from her office.
It was my first and will be my last visit to her office.
She called me after my pap smear to inform me that I must right away make an appointment with her office because she needs to see me and monitor me by doing more test to make sure that I have no cervical cancer.
She told me that the test result came back and it showed that I had Genital infection HPV (cause of cervical cancer). She told me that it is very important that I see you right away.
I was shucked since I was not sexually involved with anyone for the past several years as well my annual pap smear was always satisfactory and HPV 16 and 18 (cause of cervical cancer) done with my pap smear was always not detected and negative.
When I questioned her, she got nervous and started screaming that it is very important that I see you right away.
After, I hang up the phone with Dr. Taz Elizabeth Varkey, I called her office and asked her staff to fax me a copy of my test result. My pap smear was satisfactory for evaluation NOTE: No Endocervical /Transformation zone component present and HPV 16 and HPV 18 result was NOT detected and negative.
She is a con art-ist that would do anything that is possible to make more money.
