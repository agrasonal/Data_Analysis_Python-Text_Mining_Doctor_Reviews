1,Dr. Paunel Grivej,Detroit,Michigan, Family Doctors / G.P.s , Male,13,4.39,2015-04-28T16:56:58.373Z,3,3,3,2,4,"He is thorough and knowledgeable as he should be, he is a doctor. He does not communicate and his office hours are very inconvenient. I feel I was discriminated against as without notice the day before an appointment I got a call from his office stating he would no longer be my primary care physician for a reason I was never made aware of until refusal to treat. I feel there are circumstances that have nothing to do with me as a patient that relate to his refusal to treat me. The reason I was given could have been taken care with a phone call from his office. How was I able to make an appointment if I was no longer his patient? Why was I not notified prior to my appointment that this decision had been made?
Go to him as he his is a doctor, but just know he seems to forget he deals with humans, and in a random moment of need when you are in physical pain due to an accident unrelated to anything else he could say you are no longer his patient. "

He is thorough, knowledgeable, patient, kind, and if I have questions, he goes out of his way to give me helpful answers. He suggests solutions that I haven't thought of, and he is NOT anxious to prescribe medication. He encourages me to avoid meds if not necessary. I am so glad that I found this physician. I am very satisfied with his care. He does encourage bloodwork to be done to be sure that everything is all right, and when it is, he is obviously pleased."

I was referred to him as I was new to the area. Dr. Grivej is an excellent, caring doctor. The fact that he remembers things about me between visits still amazes me. The fact that he has the same staff as he did in 2003 I believe says a lot about him as an employer, as well as a person and doctor. He has never ran any unnecessary tests to make money as another has suggested. As a matter of fact, he doesn't like to do x-rays unless medically necessary so we are not exposed to the radiation. I have had doctors in the past that will do that just for the cash. When I was having financial difficulties, he wrote off my family's debt. He takes the time necessary with his patients and does not turn you away if you walk in without an appointment. He sees everyone, even if they have to stay late. He's not a God, but he is a very good doctor and a good person. I recently moved about half an hour away, yet will keep Dr. Grivej as my doctor."

Move on!"

I had a different problem with him: I asked him to write a script to get the tests done at a different lab that is closer to home, but he wanted me to come and do it at his office (I got the impression he tries to maximize his office visits). So after I asked for a script to be called into a lab near me that my insurance covers - he literally screamed at me on the phone suggesting that I am questioning him and threatening that unless I do tests in his office, my insurance won't cover it. I never saw him again. I was very upset the way I was treated."

Watching him listen patiently and compassionatly while my 82 year old mother rambled and slowly complained while trying to explain her ""situation"" he gets all my admiration.

She was extremely personable and I liked her and her qualified staff immediately. Very professional but down to earth and spent a large amount of time going over with me the proper procedures for different ways of handling my medications. I felt I was in very good hands and I look forward to returning for my follow up visit. Unlike most doctor's offices, I didn't have to call back for my test results, they must work pretty quickly because I got a call from them about 3 days later telling me my test results and it was very reassuring that she and her staff take the guess work out of medicine. She was amazing and I loved her personality!"

Her assistant told me that she is a thorough doctor and as the day goes on patients have to wait a while to see her. She prescribed me antibiotics and sent me on my way. After finishing the dose for ten days my sinus infection had not gotten any better. I called the call center on Tuesday 2/7/17 in the morning to see if she could give me a different prescription or if she needed to see me again for an appointment. On Wednesday 2/8/17 I had yet to hear from the doctor so I called again. The call center was confused as to why the doctor had not reached out to me yet and that they would put a second notification for her to call me. The call center also stated that they couldn't offer me an appointment either because she was booked up. I ended up seeing a different doctor who was able to prescribe me a stronger antibiotic. I am now feeling 100% better. Today, someone from her office decided to return my call to check on my symptoms. A week after my second phone call to their office. Some thorough doctor she is. I am in the medical field and understand how schedules can change with emergencies and add ins but that is rediculous! Clearly, she only values her own time."

I have never written a review on anything before, but felt compelled to so after my visit with her today. This is a Doctor who truly cares about her patients, she never once made me feel like I needed to rush and is extremely compassionate and understanding.

I have a chronic condition so I felt it would be helpful to advise her what was going on. She was extremely hostile, demanding to know why I was there before she hardly even introduced herself. She basically said she couldn't help me before I could even get my story out about needing a new primary care doctor. She made me feel so uncomfortable and unwanted. There was no loving caring demeanor here. She was rude and hostile. I have never been treated like this by a doctor before."

She left the room for a moment and I could hear her laughing and talking with the nurses and then came back eating a granola bar or something. Clearly helping me wasn't a priority.

Friedman,Richmond,Michigan, Family Doctors / G.P.s , Female,9,3.69,2008-11-03T09:45:09Z,2,2,3,2,1,"This doctor made me bleed during a routine pelvic exam, refused to test my thyroid even though I asked her to, and was generally careless during each appointment. She did things like jam the instrument painfully into my infected and swollen ear, and over-prescribed unnecessary medications in order to get the appointment over with."

I came to her with a skin issue (years later confirmed as simple psoriasis by another doctor), which she diagnosed incorrectly. Her directions as to how to treat the skin issue involved the use of alcohol scrubs and treatments to rid the infection. This of course seriously dried out the psoriasis ridden skin, causing immense pain, peeling and cracking and more than likely was a large reason why the area in a short period of time developed MRSA. YES, MRSA. Not once, not twice but THREE times in the course of a couple of months. She continued to treat it incorrectly again, and again and again until I was hospitalized and put on IV antibiotics that caused my spleen to swell while I was on them. I was told just not to take any hits to my torso because it might cause it to rupture. Eventually, I just stopped going to see her all together, because dealing with the skin issue sans MRSA seemed better than her treatments that obviously were not working. Flash forward to a couple of years later when I confront a new doctor about the skin issue. It took her maybe 2 seconds of looking at the area to know what this very common skin condition was. She gave me an ointment, and voila! It began clearing up the next day. My grand parents had numerous health issues in their old age, which of course is to be expected. Puno was their primary care doctor, and both have since passed. As I said, they certainly were nearing the end of their lives, but I shudder to think if she could miss such a simple thing and put me through so much turmoil, what could she have been missing with them?

I trust her with my daughter, and she has overseen my daughter's health since childhood and now in to her teen years. If she is not as knowledgeable about a particular condition she has never hesitated to refer us to a specialist. When my daughter and wife both had their respective health issues, Dr. Puno referred us to excellent specialist. One doctor was so go I credit him, and Dr. Puno, for saving my wife's life. I will keep her as my family doctor for years to come.She is usually pretty good on getting us in on an emergency/urgent basis too."

I loved her at first but lately I've started thinking about changing doctors. First off they are always running behind, my standard wait time has turned into an hour or more each visit. The staff seems stressed and not very friendly. They never say hello or greet you at your appointments. Dr. Puno used to take the time to listen and really get your background, now too she seems stressed and in a hurry. Instead of finding a solution she is always prescribing medicine to mask the symptoms. I'm just starting to get very frustrated."

It might be due to the foreign accent that she does not seem to be articulate or thorough in explanation. This is a critical must in having good communication with patients. She mumbles and her voice trails off- again, not a sign that gives me much confidence that she knows what she's talking about. I just really did not feel that she was competent."

He has always been professional and given me very good care. What I find most important is that Dr. Harris will go a step further and make a referral to a specialist anytime my health made one mandatory. He can be rather aloof, but always professional. I saw him yesterday and he seemed jollier than usual; possibly because I chose to follow him to his Sterling Heights office when the one in Detroit was closed. He gave me a very effusive greeting and smiled during my entire office visit."

Her employees are not certified and they write her scrips. People don't even come into her office because they know if they call with a sob story shell just give them whatever.

But that doesn't happen anymore! She's compassionate, caring, friendly, family oriented and nice, but I sometimes questioned her. Everytime we had to see her (for whatever) we had to go get XRays (became a joke at home). One time, I was desperate and took my baby to her (pediatritian not avail), she did a urine test and told me my daughter had alot of blood in urine. *Cups were kept upside down in bathroom for anyone to touch and not sanitizing wipes for clean catch* Went to pediatritian first thing in AM and there was no blood. Poor call. She has one GREAT Nurse, but the rest of them are Extremely unprofessional, dress and talk the same way. One time actually came into my room to pull her out for a phone call of a patient who just wanted to know what time her appt was(I could hear). I was hot!!!

She is knowlegable and kind. She once drove me home after an appointment because I was 15 and pregnant and had no transportation.Hows that for being a caring doctor. I also enjoyed her staff greatly (shout out to Sonya). Only thing I did not care for was the hour-half to two hour wait from each appointment in the small waiting room. I do believe that is the only reason I had to stop going there. I just couldnt take a day off work each time one of us had an appointment.

What has been said about appointments meaning nothing is basically true--however, it's because the doctors in this practice spend as much time as is necessary with each patient, rather than rushing them through like other doctors I've seen. Dr. Rice thoroughly listens, follows up, and sends you for a second opinion when she feels it's needed. She is the most thoroughly un-arrogant doctor I've ever seen. She knows a lot, but she is not afraid to acknowledge her limits. I'd much rather have a doctor like this than one who pretends he knows all the answers when he doesn't."

To this day we still go see her even though its a bit of a drive. And I was happy to have her deliver and now care for my daughters health. Only complaint is how hard it is to get an appointment with her. And dont think about walk-ins you will be waiting for several hours in a cramped over packed office.

Just because someone acts arrogant and as if they know everything, does not mean they do. He's friendly but that is of no value to YOUR health or pocketbook. He babbles without really saying anything useful or that will actively get your illness diagnosed (tests, etc). Be condescending and treat the symptoms, don't bother to find out what the h*ll the illness is. That's him! Hope it's not life-threatening. I really don't understand the positive reviews. Friendliness and confidence should never be construed as knowledgeable and competent. What's wrong with people...."

He makes a point of treating you as if you were a member of his own family. Dr. murphy saved my life. I had another physician before him and had been misdiagnosed for many years, however when I went to see Dr. Murphy he quickly corrected that and now I'm on the right track I am truly thankful for him and I let him know every time I visit his office. One of the main things I like about Dr. Melvin Murphy is if he can't seem to figure out what is wrong with you he has no problem sending you to someone who does. That means a lot to me because as I stated before I had been misdiagnosed for years because my previous physician would not refer me to another physician or run further tests, he continued to guess. However Dr. Murphy is not that type of doctor.I truly believe that he was sent to me from above. Dr. Murphy has truly saved my life. He is excellent."

She diagnoised me with Strep Throat even though the rapid test came back negative and it turned out to be nothing more than a sinus infection. I ended up taking antibiotics that I didn't need to take.

The wait time is horrible- have never seen the doctor within one hour of my arrival time. But when I do finally see him, he is very interested in what you have to say, takes time to catch up with you, and always explains diagnosis and treatments in terms you can understand. I understand why there may be a slight wait to see him, as he spends a great deal of time with his patients, but I still cannot understand why it takes so long to be seen once you sign in."

He helped me in getting stable with a new condition (that the specialist wasn't getting right), and always took the time to listen. He made good suggestions, and worked with me to help me. He was never on time for my appointments, but I stayed with him in spite of this because he was good for me. The only reason I left was because of a move, in which it wasn't practical to continue to see him."

I had several with wrong dosages, strength, etc. Thankfully my pharmasist caught his blunders. When talking to him, his mind wanders, making you wonder if he is even listening. I have changed doctors, and they have changed most of my meds and treatments from him. He was a good doctor, but gives the impression he may be drugged or have a mental problem. I will never recommend him to anyone."

He treats everyone equally and i assure you that you will keep going to Dr. Awada once you have met him. Please do not listen to these awful comments because i am sure this is just being done out of hate for a person who does not deserve this kind of treatment ! DR.

He will write you a script for anything without even examining. I said I had an itch, he wrote me 2 antibiotics. What itch? Where? Who cares?? He didn't. One time, he actually said I should thank him for spending so much time with my son that day (4 1/2 min). I'm worried about my son's inability to breath, he's not interested. Sends me to an endocronologist instead. He is rude, egomaniacal, over scheduled, no empathy. People are only appts. no faces, he will argue with you, lie to you, and ignore you. Stands with the door open and talks about your private health in the hall, and then walks away as you ask a question. I've moved on after 1 year of this abuse. I found a great doctor now, and I am happy and much much healthier. This doctor will kill you if you don't get away from him. He only cares about $$ and scamming and lying. He is definitely a sociopath!"

He is 1st concerned with the almighty dollar. He thinks that he is a specialist in all areas, when he should really just stick to family medicine and continue his studies. If he (or ANY doctor) tells you that you can ""stop seeing your specialist because I can do that here,"" do not listen to him. Unfortunately our family trusted him and she stopped seeing her blood specialist and neurologist. Could things have been different if she had stayed with them? Perhaps - but we will never know. Regardless, ANY doctor who recommends to stop seeing your specialist is money hungry and trying to get more business himself. There are other docters in the St. John network who refuse to work with this doctor. St. John is a good hospital, find a differnt doctor besides Awada."

The assistant asked me to get on the scale, then just stuck a thermometer in my ear as it was calculating my weight.No warning.She actually got her hand caught in my hair trying to get under my hair to reach my ear. I would've tucked my hair behind my ear for her -rude and unprofessional. The exam room was dirty & smaller than a hotel bathroom. The Dr. came(and already on a short time frame-they give us about 15 min.)& proceeded to waste the time with trivial questions pertaining to my married life & my vagina.Voiced my annoyance(was there for a lump on my skull), Dr. got pissy.WTH was I thinking-BAD CHOICE.Walked out"

Then me and about 10 other patients were all herded into his office waiting room like cattle. . . to wait and wait and wait. The worse was when it took Dr. Baul 1 week to call in my refill to the pharmacy. Unacceptable! Please avoid this doctor if you value your health!

She was nice, kind, and was able to make me feel comfortable being at the doctors. She is very knowledgeable about anything that I asked questions about, from immunizationsto specialty doctors.

Went in for a simple problem and without even examining me assumed what my issue was and blamed it on something irrelevant. Do not see this doctor if you don't enjoy the stigma that lingers with anxiety/depression. She lectured me for a good hr on something irrelevant but couldnt even figure out a simple diagnosis, which came to me a few days later and my problem is now fixed, no thanks to her. I have no idea how she can work in the field that she is in... she needs to work away from people since she acts like she is a million times better than everyone and speaks down to you. Will never, ever go back or ever recommend her office. Terrible."

She ran tests on me without even so much as telling me what they would be. I thought it was going to be something small, but it wasn't. I have a large bill I have to deal with and none of the staff will help me. She is rude and would not let me tell her my history and assumed what my problems were. Will NEVER go back here.

She was rude, and condescending. She wouldn't listen when attempting to discuss symptoms of what was wrong with me. She told me I was being ""Nitpicky"", and that I was just going to have to accept the fact that I will struggle with (my ailment) for the rest of my life. I self prescribed a treatment based on information I found on the internet, and all of my symptoms were corrected within 2-3 months. Today I went in only to have her order a blood test recommended by my mothers hematologist due to a genetic blood mutation. She was very condescending in her questioning. She acted like it was a waste of her time. After she left the room I waited for about 20 minutes for someone to give me the blood work order. That will be my last trip to her office."

She didn't look at my file nor did she look at the x-rays I brought in. She didn't even look at my shoulder, which was the main reason I was there, to ask for help with the pain. She cut me off with all the new patient questions, like I was stupid and needed redirected or like she didn't have time to actually listen to me. She corrected me on one of my diagnoses, which was odd b/c it has been read to me like the way I said by every other doctor I've ever had. I guess she's smarter than everyone else. She didn't even do an exam, just judged me from where she sat. After she made her snap judgment, she was done and I actually had to ask her to examine me a little bit for flu-like symptoms so I could make sure I wasn't giving anything to my daughter. I haven't had a panic attack in weeks, after seeing her, I have had four so far. I hope they don't let her see kids."

She told me my pain was normal even though I was miserable. Upon me explaining my concerns/symptoms she didn't listen and cut me off multiple times not even letting me complete my concerns before she left the room.

You can't ask questions, you can't get a return phone call from the doctor, and I was told if I didn't CALL THEM BACK and confirm my appointment 48 hours prior then MY APPOINTMENT WOULD BE CANCELLED. WHEN WILL I FIND OUT MY APPOINTMENT WAS CANCELLED - WHEN I SHOW UP! SERIOUSLY?

His time (& lack of)-MY MONEY! Ordered a bunch of tests on child. Said the strep test was negative & NEVER called about results of the MRI which WE insisted on. Took my child back in, with worsening symptoms-debilitating migraines that just started occurring for no reason with no triggers & almost every day. We saw a different QUACK in the office. New Dr mentioned the positive strep results & how high/low the various test level were. WHAT?????? Dr Lieb never called parents about. Now it's weeks later & new Dr doesn't see point in addressing further. Mentions the BRAIN cyst on the MRI- that Dr Lieb never contacted parents about. Because her mother has had a few headaches a year(literally probably three & those were due to eye strain & lack of sleep) blew the whole gd thing off as hereditary migraines. Child will probably have a life-threatening crisis & we'll bear the emotional & financial horror.FIRED"

I am to take onec a day she prescribed for twice a day. I was not notified of a need for change. I called the pharmacy to confirm my normal dosage. I called the doctor she told me that, the girls up front(receptionist) wrote my precription. my concern is those people that are not catching her mistakes. The two incidents with her incompetence were caught with me but there is something wrong. Why would she lie and say the girls up front wrote the prescrition unless she is aware of her wrongdoings.

The people they service look like they are at a free clinic. They don't listen to your healthcare needs or problems. They mix blood and urine work, stuff is improperly labeled. Making an appointment is useless they will still be a waiting period unless you opt to see a Dr. you really don't want to. I have never seen a doctor's office ran with such sloppiness and filth. How do you misspell your patients name or address? If they can't properly fill out a form no way they could properly take in, label, and file paperwork. Save your time and your children if you are looking for a family or personal doctor then look elsewhere, this dump is not for you. So sad, I knew I shouldn't have ever gone there let alone my children, thank God they never did my pap, probably would've mixed some results and told me I had cancer or something... Smh!"
