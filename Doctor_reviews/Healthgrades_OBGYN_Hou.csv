4	Aug 04, 2016	3	Obstetrics & Gynecology	Dr. Marcos Ikeda	Houston,	15	3	No c-section option. My baby was measuring 8.2 at 32 weeks. I delivered at 41 weeks because he would induce me.

5	Jun 15, 2016	3	Obstetrics & Gynecology	Dr. Marcos Ikeda	Houston,	15	None	Over 3 hours waiting time, no sense of urgency at all for pregnant women. This doctor schedules other activities before his patients and instead of asking his staff to reschedule patients, makes them wait. Accotding to several women in the chaotic waiting area, this happens regularly. I had to leave my children unattended because i was unable to pick them up on time. Its sad that healthcare is reflected in such a nonchalant manner. I was really excited about this appointment until i got there.	None	None	TX	1	3.4	None

By her own admission, it was ""unconventional.""  I never asked for an unconventional labor.  As a result my pubic symphysis separated, and I had to use a walker for 6 weeks.  She wouldn't concede that it was her fault or that there was anything wrong with me at all.  The physical therpist was the hero in this scenario.  The PT diagnosed me and put me on a regimen to recovery.  Would never recommend Leeds-Richter to anyone."	4	16 – 30 minutes	TX	1	3.8	4

Everything was benign. She said, ""Only three or four of her patients had results like me."" That's three or four too many to feel horrible everyday! One is too many! I just survive everyday.

595	Sep 16, 2018	3	Maternal-Fetal Medicine	Dr. Joanie Hare	Houston,	65	3	Not a good experience for me. We went twice and  it only was her bedside manner poor, but she completely forgot to check something on my baby that she had raised concern over two weeks prior. I was already stressed and when I asked one question she seemed so annoyed. I called the office to request a change of doctor and they said they would have to know a specific reason why, and then said they would tell her.

598	Mar 22, 2017	3	Maternal-Fetal Medicine	Dr. Joanie Hare	Houston,	65	3	I had my anatomy scan with Dr. Hare. Her first initial approach to my husband and I was a little off putting, and I can tell she was just raised by very serious parents. Once we sat down and started the ultrasound she was very serious, but my husband started random conversation with her(he talks a lot) about her hometown. From there she became very pleasant and more comfortable with us. She even gave us a shot of our baby's face in 4D which I know lots of doctors don't do. She's was great! 	3	31 – 45 minutes	TX	4	3.0	3
599	Mar 16, 2017	3	Maternal-Fetal Medicine	Dr. Joanie Hare	Houston,	65	3	I had my 1st visit with Dr. Hare today & it was horrible!  Her attitude was atrocious!  She was extremely rude to me I couldn't ask any questions  ! My ultrasound was so unpleasant with her ,  I wanted to get up and run out the room. Her ultrasound tech had to apologize to me for her nasty attitude. I was told she's always like that. I called my obgyn and immediately asked her to refer me to someone else. I wouldn't refer a stray dog to her for services. 	3	31 – 45 minutes	TX	1	3.0	3
600	Feb 24, 2017	3	Maternal-Fetal Medicine	Dr. Joanie Hare	Houston,	65	3	Dr. Joanie Hare is an excellent physician. She was referred by my OB when I went on bedrest during pregnancy. When she came into the room, she allowed us to explain why we were there and put us at ease. She was funny and respectful and very giving of her time. She explained everything to us in great detail ( her measurements, the equipment).

602	Dec 05, 2016	3	Maternal-Fetal Medicine	Dr. Joanie Hare	Houston,	65	3	My appointment time was set to 12:40 pm. 2hrs later, I was called in. 1 patient walked out while I waited. The others told me she was late. There was no communication from her to patients about the delay. She walked in without any welcoming intro/eye contact. She did not apologize for her behavior for lack of keeping her commitments. She was not personable (I spoke to my husband and she interrupted saying she couldn't talk and think at the same time). She accepted a call while doing my scan! 	3	31 – 45 minutes	TX	1	3.0	3
603	Oct 13, 2016	3	Maternal-Fetal Medicine	Dr. Joanie Hare	Houston,	65	3	She came in while i was on bedrest at Woman's Hospital of Texas. She was not my doctor however was the on call doctor for the weekend. To say her bedside manner was awkward would be an understatement. Dr. Hare burst in my room at almost 8 that night, barely introduced herself or even came into the light so i could see who she was. She was unfriendly, asked 3  questions and walked out. I remember telling my fiancee that if i went into labor and she was there u would try and tie my legs together!!	3	31 – 45 minutes	TX	1	3.0	3
604	Sep 20, 2016	3	Maternal-Fetal Medicine	Dr. Joanie Hare	Houston,	65	3	The office wait time is extensive. I had an appointment today at 10:40 and was not seen by the doctor until almost 11:45. When Dr. Hare came into the room she did not greet me with a smile or a hello. She simply sat down and poured the ultrasound gel on my stomach. She then began clicking on the ultrasound machine for about 30 seconds before she even said anything to me. I will not be going back to her and letting my OB/gyn know about my experience with her. Unfriendly, long wait time, etc. 	3	31 – 45 minutes	TX	1	3.0	3

606	Dec 22, 2015	3	Maternal-Fetal Medicine	Dr. Joanie Hare	Houston,	65	5	She is the most rudest women I have ever met. She doesn't seem happy with her work and expresses it vividly to her patients and coworkers. I would highly recommend seeing doctor Reiter instead. While seeing her I felt so rushed and when we confronted her with our concerns for our child she so rudely ignored them as if we didnt know what we were talking about at all. I wouldn't recommend her to anyone. Her attitude is unacceptable and creates a stressful environment for all involved.	5	10 – 15 minutes	TX	1	3.0	5

653	Jul 27, 2016	4	Internal Medicine	Dr. Carmen Perez	Kingwood,	28	3	We have been waiting on hospital bed for the last 7 months. DR. Perez's assistant Wynn, is the reason. She swears she hasn't seen a request.  I had to get someone else involved 3 times recently &  everything was there. DR will issue new RX & she doesn't call them in because she thinks they have enough. Pharmacy waits for weeks on her to call them in or correct her mistakes. I waited a month on insulin RX to be corrected because there were no directions or dosage.  That was a deadly error. 	2	31 – 45 minutes	TX	1	3.2	4

Today I waited 2 hours to see an orthopedic surgeon for a fractured arm.  The referral was done I was assured weeks ago by Perezes office person.  Well the surgeon would not take me cause in the end we find it was never done.  Perez again the good Dr. Is not worth the constant problem with the office staff.  Today I leave with an arm that needs attention badly.	2	31 – 45 minutes	TX	1	3.2	4
