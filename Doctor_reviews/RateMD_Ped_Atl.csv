LeDuc,Atlanta,Georgia,pediatrician, Female,25,4.47,2018-09-27T21:20:40.956Z,2,1,1,3,3,"The center seems to be busy, staff does not seems to be well trained professional for infants/toddlers. Expect your appointment to be delayed anywhere from 30 mins to an hour. Billing charges is very confusion, charges billed could not be explained."
1,Dr. Elizabeth M. LeDuc,Atlanta,Georgia, Pediatricians , Female,25,4.47,2014-10-29T03:23:41.060Z,4.8,5,4,5,5,"Dr. LeDuc has cared for all three of our children for nearly ten years. She has been so fantastic. We find her advice and guidance to be helpful and thorough. Dr. LeDuc is progressive in her methods and uses all available resources . She stays with you in order to help you feel comfortable with any situation that has come up from tubes, heart murmurs and even required surgeries. She is caring, knowledge and kind. We can always get an appointment and she has been available to us even after hours with the same level of care and enthusiasm. Her office staff is also helpful and great with the kids, even when it's shots. We trust our children's health to her!"
2,Dr. Elizabeth M. LeDuc,Atlanta,Georgia, Pediatricians , Female,25,4.47,2014-10-26T17:13:43.309Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr LeDuc has cared for my four children for over a decade. I followed Dr. LeDuc to her new practice several years ago because i knew she was interested in the whole child and the family SYSTEM and not just the SYMPTOM that was presenting or precipitating the ""appointment."" Dr. LeDuc has gone out of her way and ""partnered"" with me to find the best solutions that fit my particular child and issue at hand...She has guided me through broken bones, chronic (not live threatening but annoying) health conditions which have gone into ""remission"" so to speak and just the overall health of my kids. I have received no judgement and only support when i was ""last minute"" on physicals and shots needed for camps and other activities. I have appreciated that Dr. LeDuc takes the time (rather than rushing off to see another patient) to TALK with my kiddos and help them to embrace for themselves, positive health habits and choices. I have especially appreciated the fact that Dr. Leduc will folllow your child, if already a patient, through college! It was traumatic enough as each of my older kids left home for college, without now having to FIND another doctor to treat them while in college! I can't imagine trusting anyone else with my precious ones."

She is very knowledgeable, caring ,remembers details about past experiences , and follows up with us if needed.She's my kids favorite dr.We love Dr. LeDuc !!!"

LeDuc,Atlanta,Georgia, Pediatricians , Female,25,4.47,2014-10-25T12:17:41.919Z,5,5,5,5,5,"My daughter's have been patients of Dr. LeDuc's for over a year now, and we will never see another Pediatrician again. Dr. LeDuc is very knowledgeable, yet very compassionate at the same time. She takes her time and has no issue listening and helping me resolve my ""list"" of concerns. She is also very knowledgeable about natural remedies to common childhood illnesses. My oldest daughter has asthma, and Dr. LeDuc is great about same-day appointments whenever she is sick. We also really love Dr. LeDuc because she focuses on prevention and wellness, so our kids become healthy adults. Her office staff is very friendly and helpful too. My husband actually enjoys going to the kids' doctor visits, because Dr. LeDuc acknowledges his role in the girls' care and takes the time to listen to his concerns as well. Best Pediatrician in Atlanta!"

I have never seen a doctor care so deeply for her patients. She takes the time THE PATIENT needs with her. She is very thorough and smart. As patients (or parents) we don't always want to hear what the doctor tells us but she delivers news with extreme passion and concern and I cannot say that for very many doctors. My son was very jaundice after he was born and he should have been treated with bili lights in the hospital before they discharged us. She was our advocate made special phone calls for things to happen stat for him to get re-admitted and then called us after hours to check on us. This woman is truly a one of a kind pediatrician."
6,Dr. Elizabeth M. LeDuc,Atlanta,Georgia, Pediatricians , Female,25,4.47,2014-10-24T19:21:01.264Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. LeDuc is an amazing pediatrician! We have been with her since my daughter was born (13 years ago) and we could not be happier. Dr. LeDuc is a very professional and compassionate doctor who listens and cares. She has children of her own, which I personally think makes her an even better pediatrician -- who better to understand what you and your child are going through. Whether the office visit is a well visit or sick visit, she is compassionate, understanding and uses common sense -- we love that. Dr. LeDuc talks directly with our child, listens and asks her questions too. The last 13 years have been a very positive experience and I would not change a thing. When I tell my child we have an appointment with Dr. LeDuc, she is never scared or worried… she knows that Dr. LeDuc always takes good care of her. We could not ask for a better pediatrician and medical partner -- we have recommended Dr. LeDuc for the past 13 years and will continue to do so!"

Dr leduc always cared enough to figure out everything that was wrong before we left. She never left with my daughter on treated. She was the first doctor to realize my daughter was depressed and needing immediate attention before it got even worse. Without Dr. Leduc paying that close attention I don't think we would have been able to get my daughter the help she needed before it was too late. Dr leduc is a warm hearted well knowledge doctor. That review below is not accurate at all.

I can't thank her enough for all that she has done for my Kids. Not only does she care about my children, she has been a great support for me as a friend! My both kids goes to her office since they were born. Dr. Leduc is very personable & knowledgeable. She takes the time to answer all of your questions & is always reassuring me that I'm a good mother. She is always educating on the use of vitamins, exercise & correct foods to eat. She is the best doctor. We love her."

I can't thank her enough for all that she has done for my family. Not only does she care about my children, she has been a great support for me as a mom! She has taught me so much. She has been there around the clock to help my children on sick days as well as at well check-ups. Couldn't ask for a better doctor!"
10,Dr. Kirsten S. Mekelburg,Atlanta,Georgia, Pediatricians , Female,21,4.46,2015-05-28T21:11:53.686Z,5,5,5,5,5,We have a child with some extra needs and had a really difficult first year as we searched for more answers. Dr. Mekleburg went above and beyond for us. Called us at home from her vacation to let us know that test results were taking a little bit longer than she had hoped to get back. She is innovative and very well respected by all of the gazilluon specialists with which we have come into contact this year. She's always been so patient with our first time parent questions. Never made us feel rushed. So normal and breaks things down for us -- not just bombarding us with medical jargon assuming that we are all well-versed with complicated medical jargon. We cannot sing her praises enough. 
11,Dr. Kirsten S. Mekelburg,Atlanta,Georgia, Pediatricians , Female,21,4.46,2013-09-16T09:08:50Z,4.8,5,4,5,5,"I have a child with special needs, and Dr Mekelburg helped us through a very difficult first few months. She coordinated care with my child's specialists who were all saying the main issue we had fell under a different specialty's management. She helped resolve confusing study results from the hospital by getting us an appointment with the right specialist to review the study and answer our questions. We never feel rushed at our appointments, and Dr Mekelburg always asks how the parents and baby are doing. Sometimes we have to wait up to 45 minutes, but that is just the nature of going to the doctor's office: patients run late and put the doctor behind, some appointments take longer than others, and I am sure some parents have a million questions. I would rather wait occasionally and know all my concerns will be addressed than be rushed but always on time. Dr Mekelburg has gone above and beyond what most doctors would do to ensure my baby is getting appropriate medical care."
12,Dr. Kirsten S. Mekelburg,Atlanta,Georgia, Pediatricians , Female,21,4.46,2013-08-01T19:42:56Z,4.8,5,4,5,5,"WE LOVE DR. MEKELBURG! She is an amazing physician, and just an awesome person. She is a mom and the combination of her medical knowledge and her mom smarts has helped me so much. She is able to offer great perspective and is a very laid back, personable physician. She takes each visit on a case-by-case basis, not lumping my kids' problems into some chart of averages, but instead looking at my children's overall health and physical situation and medical history. We love her - we moved, and still drive a long way to go and see her. Highly recommend!"
13,Dr. Kirsten S. Mekelburg,Atlanta,Georgia, Pediatricians , Female,21,4.46,2013-07-12T15:23:20Z,4.5,5,3,5,5,"Mekelburg is fantastic. Our first born is now 9 months, and she and her staff have always been responsive, informative and patient. I have great faith in Mekelburg's competence, and, find her to be very reassuring and no-nonsense. Although we sometimes have to wait long past our scheduled appointment time to be seen, she always takes her time and answers the long laundry list of questions I bring to every visit. My husband and I feel lucky to have found her."
14,Dr. Kirsten S. Mekelburg,Atlanta,Georgia, Pediatricians , Female,21,4.46,2012-12-30T15:25:15Z,1.8,1,4,1,1,"Your concerns will most likely be dismissed by Dr. Mekelburg. I was told that ""you are just a nervous first time mom"". My concerns later confirmed by 3 specialists. I found this practice to be lax and full of their egos. Rather than listen to the parents who know their children best, they are dismissive. I was very disappointed b/c this practice came so highly recommended. Nearly 3yrs after leaving this practice I've talked w/at least a dozen moms who also had bad experiences. My son’s neurologist said great I pursued my concerns re my son’s development early b/c many are often diagnosed with Autism too late. After 3 years of early intervention my son is transitioning into a typical public school class– thanks to trusting my instinct & following my gut! Mom’s know best; always seek out opinions until you are satisfied. You're your child’s best advocate!Mekelburg never called to find out why we left her practice – just shows the true level of concern for patients. Hmmmm."
15,Dr. Kirsten S. Mekelburg,Atlanta,Georgia, Pediatricians , Female,21,4.46,2012-11-16T08:01:53Z,4.8,5,4,5,5,Dr. Mekelburg is terrific. Every visit with my twins has been a pleasure. She remembers their names and an incident that happened at one of their very early visits over 10 years ago. She takes time and fully discusses issues and options. Nearly always on time appointments.
16,Dr. Kirsten S. Mekelburg,Atlanta,Georgia, Pediatricians , Female,21,4.46,2012-09-14T13:15:13Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Our family is so happy with the level of care we receive from Dr. Mekelburg. She is kind and empathetic to both the kids and their concerned parents. She explains her insights in great detail, but also in a way that's easy to comprehend. Dr. Mekelburg is also very respectful of parents' wishes and seeks to find the best method to treat the situation so the end result of good health is achieved. We're so grateful to Dr. Mekelburg. Thank you!"

Mekelburg,Atlanta,Georgia, Pediatricians , Female,21,4.46,2009-02-19T10:19:11Z,4.8,5,5,4,5,"Dr.Kristin has been my daughter ped. since birth and I liked her since I went to my pre birth appointment and she was pregnant herself. She is a no nonsense Dr. and she will tell you what you need to know ever step of the way so be ready to be hot with A TON of INFORMATION when you see her as yes the visit can be rushed but being in the medical field myself I know how many patients these Dr's have to see in a day so that they can keep their practices open, pay their employees well and your child healthy.The only thing I didnt like about the practice qwas that on a coupe of occassions I took my daughter in for the dreaded ear infection that we knew she had, her tests would come out as not an infection and then literally 2 days later we would be back in with a true infection and we asked that since we had just literally been in 2 days earlier if our co-pay could be waived becasue my daughter had just been on 2 days earlier and now we had to pay again and we were told no.Overall=recommend"
18,Dr. Kirsten S. Mekelburg,Atlanta,Georgia, Pediatricians , Female,21,4.46,2008-10-10T20:09:40Z,3.3,3,4,2,4,"We recently left Children's Wellness Center because of issues with the doctors. Not sure why they have to talk down to parents but this happened on more than one occasion. Using things like ""...I am sure this is over your head"" is not the way to talk to new parents. We were very impressed with our pre-birth visit but were very disappointed with Mekelburg and Seigel. Dr. Bussey saw us once and seemed better. Too bad cause it was a convenient location and we thought i would be perfect. I prefer my medicine and that for my child to be attitude free. Always felt rushed too. Oh well. Just our honest opinion."
19,Dr. Kirsten S. Mekelburg,Atlanta,Georgia, Pediatricians , Female,21,4.46,2007-12-17T16:12:08Z,5,5,5,5,5,We had our son 01/08 and completely forgot to find a Pediatrician. A Dr. friend of mine told me about Kirsten Mekelburg and we couldn't be happier. The ENTIRE staff is amazing.

24,Dr. H. Robert Harrison,Atlanta,Georgia, Pediatricians , Male,5,4.9,2008-07-16T09:11:31Z,5,5,5,5,5,Dr. Harrison is very practical and VERY knowledgeable. Nurses and Doctors at other practises in other areas of medicine have always spoken very highly of him and his expertise when I have stated he's my daughter's pediatrician. Receiving such high accolades from ones peers speaks volumes to me. I'd highly recommend him.
25,Dr. Philip R. Spandorfer,Atlanta,Georgia, Pediatricians , Male,3,5,2017-10-19T16:20:14.957Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Best doctor anyone could ever hope to find. He is patient, kind and knowledgeable. He goes out of his way with his own personal time to assist patients in need."

27,Dr. Philip R. Spandorfer,Atlanta,Georgia, Pediatricians , Male,3,5,2012-05-30T10:26:30Z,5,5,5,5,5,"When searching for a pediatrician while in my 8th or 9th month of pregnancy, I had no idea what to look for. I visited multiple doc offices and asked my friends, but only after meeting Dr Pip Spandorfer, did I understand what the term ""compassionate doctor"" means. Pip is quite simply awesome. He is understanding and patient, he answers all of your questions without making you feel like an idiot (this is important, because as a new mom who is lacking in sleep, you ask alot of simple questions!) Best of all, Pip will respond to emails. The phone nurses and other docs in the practices are also top notch, but when you have a non-urgent, specific question, I just love the option of emailing Dr Pip to get his expert opinion. Our oldest daughter is now 3 1/2 and our youngest is 18 months. We love going to see Dr. Pip :-)"

She was in a swim team and needed to use tampons and was not ready to do so. I needed some advice from the Doctor. I heard the Doctor say to her nurse outside that it was stupid and that she won't do it. When she came in, she said to me rudely that it was not her job to do this. She could have simply given some advice and referred us to a gynecologist. Instead she chose to be rude and obnoxious. She was also rude to my 11 year old daughter. She kept saying, ""keep your feet down. I don't want to get banged on my head"", even though she wasn't getting banged on her head. Apparently some other kid did that to her and she chose to take out her anger on my daughter. I did not expect this from my kid's pediatrician of 10 years. I will change the doctor and will never go back to this one. I was fighting back my tears as I walked out of the office from all the insults this woman threw at us."

I was a little apprehensive initially since she came from Kaiser but that was completely unfounded - she definitely knows her stuff (which we should have expected given her partner's credentials) and our kids love her! you definitely won't be disappointed w/her or any of the Dr(s) at Sandy Springs Pediatrics!"

58,Dr. Vicki W. Morgan,Atlanta,Georgia, Pediatricians , Female,4,3.88,2008-01-24T16:39:16Z,1.8,2,1,1,3,"I waited an hour to be called back to a room. Then my sick baby waited with no clothes on for another 45 minutes before I gave up and left. The doctor never came to see us. My only interaction with her was wandering around the office to ask for a drink of water. She didn't want to be bothered by a patient. Needless to say, I won't be back."

65,Dr. Patricia C. Nevius,Marietta,Georgia, Pediatricians , Female,6,3.5,2014-04-29T10:28:55Z,4.3,3,4,5,5,I've been taking my twins to Dr. Nevius for 7 months now. She is very knowledgable and our babies adore her! She has always been very warm towards us but she can be very to the point when she needs to be. I will take a doctor that knows her stuff over a bubbly doctor who is clueless any day.
66,Dr. Patricia C. Nevius,Marietta,Georgia, Pediatricians , Female,6,3.5,2009-12-17T11:16:30Z,2.3,4,3,1,1,"Our family has been utilizing this pediatric practice for 26 years. Dr. Nevius came on board about 3 years into our relationship with the practice. She is consistently rude, speaks in a demeaning manner to parents, cannot be bothered with questions (guess that's beneath her). I go out of my way to go to another office or will wait longer to see a different physician if I discover that she is at the office where my children's charts are kept. Fortunately, this practice has several other excellent options to Dr. Nevius."
67,Dr. Patricia C. Nevius,Marietta,Georgia, Pediatricians , Female,6,3.5,2009-02-05T11:54:21Z,1.8,2,1,2,2,"It is rare to find a doctor who will carefully listen and sincerely work with you, and Dr. Nevius is no exception. I might be a young mother and have no medical training, but I do know my children probably better than she does. I always leave her office feeling like I've just been talked down to. I switched to another doctor after she ordered some forms (paperwork for school) that my child didn't need. I didn't ask for the forms; she didn't ask me if I needed them, she just ordered them after the exam and then charged me full price because it wasn't covered by my insurance."
68,Dr. Patricia C. Nevius,Marietta,Georgia, Pediatricians , Female,6,3.5,2008-07-15T11:02:40Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Nevius is wonderful! She is very thorough and loveing with my son, she answers any and all questions and offers helpful information on future needs or standards. She works with each child indovidualy and helps bring out their best as opposed to rating them again textbook standards. I could not ask for a better Doctor for my child."
69,Dr. Patricia C. Nevius,Marietta,Georgia, Pediatricians , Female,6,3.5,2007-02-21T17:23:18Z,4.7,,4,5,5,"I have been my two boys to see Dr. Nevius since my 4 yr old was born. Although she may sometimes come across as a bit stern, she is wonderful. I was having difficulty nursing. She showed me how to solve the problem and I went on to nurse both my boys with no more issues. Furthermore, my kids love her too. Being stern is fine as long as you are receiving great care for your kids. And as far as the meds are concerned, I have personally never experienced her ""pushing"" medicine."
70,Dr. Patricia C. Nevius,Marietta,Georgia, Pediatricians , Female,6,3.5,2006-08-20T20:52:32Z,3.3,,4,3,3,"I have a child with several medical problems. Dr. Nevius was very good at attending to those issues. However, she lacks any sort of positive attitude or decent bedside manner. She possesses a disposition which makes a parent feel terrible upon leaving her office (I felt this on MANY occasions). Once, she even told me I was neglecting my daughter because I didn't want her on yet more medicine (she's on many - all of which are mandatory) if it could be helped. I was told, in no uncertain terms, that if I was a better mother, I would do it. What??? Better mother? Well, this mother just took her business elsewhere."

We have 2 children and have been going to him for over 5 years. He is always so kind and my children love his gregarious bedside manner! His wait times are usually less than 10 minutes and we love his staff also!

My complaints are very similar to the other people, I can go on, and on with a list of things, but I will make short. I used to bring my 2 kids to his clinic, no much because of dr. Deeb since he is a complete jerk, but he had Doctor Britanny Wilson as partner, which was the Sweetest doctor ever, well she has been replaced by another arrogant doctor just like dr. Deeb. Her name is dr. Nakeshia Brown, a complete knowledge less.
This is the third time in 5 years that he changes hid doctor partner( I'm assuming is because they all run tired of him being a such jerk. Maybe dr Brown will stay longer than the other ones, since she is has similar manners like him. "
77,Dr. Raymond J. Deeb,Atlanta,Georgia, Pediatricians , Male,9,2.67,2016-03-30T22:14:24.560Z,1,1,1,1,1,"Our experiences here with our newborn baby were very negative. They were rude to us (rushing us out the door one time, because it was ""lunchtime""; another time Dr. Deeb yelled at us ""put the cell phone down, guy"") and they were insensitive to our concerns. They also refused to deviate one bit from the AAP/CDC vaccine schedule; even telling us to ""go find another MD if you disagree"" at one point (so we did!). They thought we were crackpots for just wanting to slow down the shots a bit. (we are NOT anti-vaccine). Unfortunately we had to fire Briarcliff Pediatrics."

The staff are always friendly and the wait time is usually very short. Dr. Deeb and the other physician are always kind and make my son feel comfortable. My son actually looks forward to his doctor appointments.

This physician (that is not doctor) gave me the worst treatment, it was thought to be Hispanic, but seeing the other reviews I see that gives equal treatment to all.
Cada vez que le expresaba mis preocupaciones o le preguntaba algo, el me respondia bastante ironico y me hizo sentir como idiota muchas veces... siempre con respuestas bastante estupidas.
El 95% de las veces yo tuve que ir al hosital, porque él me daba malos diagnosticos... (pero claro que el cobraba bastante bien)
Whenever I expressed my concerns and asked him something, he answered very ironic, and made me feel like an idiot... always with a petty stupid answers.
95% of the time I had to go to hosital because he gave me bad diagnoses ... (of course he charged very well for the bad service)
lleve a mi hija con otro doctor y fue diagnosticada con varios problemas que debieron ser atendidos antes de los tres años, Ahora tiene que tomar terapias de todo tipo para ayudarla. Antes de los tres años ella podia haber obtenido mucha ayuda, pero como el disque doctor nunca escucho mis precupaciones ahora mi hija esta muy atrasada y los seguros no cubren su problema y baby's can wait era hasta antes de los tres. Estoy muy arrepentida por ir con ese imbecil
I take my daughter with another doctor and she was diagnosed with several problems that must be addressed before three years; now she has to take all kind of therapies to help her.
Before three years she could have gotten a lot of help, but as my doctor never heard no worry now my daughter is very backward and my insurance (private and expensive) does not cover the problem. The program of ""baby's can wait"" was until before three. I am very remorseful about going with that imbecile."
80,Dr. Raymond J. Deeb,Atlanta,Georgia, Pediatricians , Male,9,2.67,2013-05-09T23:02:55Z,1.5,1,3,1,1,The worst experience I've EVER had with a doctor. My husband and I were spoken to like we were complete idiots ( when I raised concerns over certain shots) and were basically told to take the shot or get out. He did not have the time to sit and talk with us about it (which he actually said ). I cannot believe this man deals with people's children on a daily basis.
81,Dr. Raymond J. Deeb,Atlanta,Georgia, Pediatricians , Male,9,2.67,2010-02-10T14:54:45Z,3.5,5,4,2,3,"I have several friends who swear by Dr. Deeb, but in my personal experience, he was very hostile, and spoke to me like an incapable child. I was a new mother at the time, and when I had questions around supplementing the baby with formula, he turned to my mother and asked her ""She will do what I'm telling her to do, won't she?"" At any rate, he may be a great doctor, but I found his bedside manner to be severely lacking. We moved to Children's Medical Group, and have been happy with the staff there."
82,Dr. Raymond J. Deeb,Atlanta,Georgia, Pediatricians , Male,9,2.67,2009-01-08T15:13:26Z,3,3,4,2,3,"Dr. Deeb is a self righteous and made me feel like a moron for questioning him. After vaccinations a couple days ago, she was acting very strange, not at all like herself. She slept constantly and wouldn't eat. I went in to make sure that it wasn't due to the immunizations (and was charged another copay) onl to be told that she was fine and was probably just in ""a bad mood"". When I asked him about the immunization/autism link theory, he got huffy, saying it was ""horse manure"" and that if people didnt agree with immunizations, he wouldnt be their doctor. On top of that, he rushed through (both) examinations of my daughter, which frightened her to tears but he didnt seem to care. Only see Dr. Deeb if you agree with the Dr.=God mentality and plan to kiss his rear for even making time to charge you."
83,Dr. Raymond J. Deeb,Atlanta,Georgia, Pediatricians , Male,9,2.67,2008-08-01T20:49:31Z,1.8,1,4,1,1,"Dr. Deeb was my pediatrician based on a wonderful experience my nephew had with him. When I had my daughter, he did NOT show up at the hospital. She had reflux, and he treated me like I was an idiot. He made me feel like I was overreacting to a little spit up. My daughter was projectile vomiting and crying ALL NIGHT LONG. Finally, he put her on Zantac and Reglan. Reglan=worst drug ever and made my 4 months old act like a Zombie. When I asked for a different med because Zantac stopped working well, he wouldn't help her. Every encounter with him came off like he was God. I finally found a different pediatrician who took me seriously and referred us to a pediatric gastro who put my daughter promptly on Prevacid. She got soooo much better!"

88,Dr. Gerson Aronovitz,Atlanta,Georgia, Pediatricians , Male,1,5,2008-07-16T22:51:11Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Aronovitz was my doctor when I was a child growing up in the 1960's, and when I had my own child I couldn't think of a better doctor to bring her to. Dr. Aronovitz and his staff have always been the most kind, considerate and compassionate individuals. He has always been 100% accurate in his diagnoses and ahead of the pack in dispensing advice."

We weren't a manila folder with green, red, purple letter stickers on the edge. We weren't a number in the electronic filing system and we never had to wait for a Dr. to remember who we were. Instead, it felt like we were family. When we spoke my concerns were genuinely addressed. I now see there is such a difference in the quality of care that he provides vs. majority of doctors still in the traditional practice. This has been such an experience for me. I have realized that doctors are normal people! We are used to having to communicate through nurses and sometimes we feel intimidated and we are scared to voice our concerns. But with Dr. T....it’s none of that. What he does for his patients, the attention given to them, and the quality of care he provides is unmatched ...... literally. He's the BEST pediatrician in Atlanta metro!"

I would rank her in the top one percent in her field. She not only treats the whole person as opposed to just his or her symptoms, but she also takes the time to get to know children and parents. Dr. Maxey has been treating my daughter for ADHD and reflux. Dr. Maxey took the time to figure out what was happening with our daughter's health and made a diagnosis after carefully weighing all of my daughter's seemingly unconnected symptoms. Dr. Maxey also helped us to diagnose and treat my daughter's ADHD and visual dyslexia. After diagnosis, Dr. Maxey spent two hours with my husband and me after hours outlining a comprehensive plan for treating my daughter's ADHD and learning challenges and answering our questions. We are forever grateful for her knowledge and for the time that she has spent with us and our daughter, getting to know our challenges, and helping us to find solutions.

My daughter didn't want to see anyone else. Then she came down with medical problems that were difficult to diagnose. The first test he did came back normal,so he wanted to label her as depressed and sent her to psychology. I fought for a refferal to a specialist. Once we started getting tests back (MRIs, EEGs, blood work, etc) showing there was definately something going on, he actually told me that the neurologist, EEG techs and lab didn't know what they were talking about. She had several seizures while undergoing one of three EEGs and he tried to tell me she does not have seizures. He said that, although the lab said she had abnormal blood work, that he was of the opinion the lab erred. He called me prejudiced because I refused to send her to a psychiatrist. I changed doctors 2 months ago and my daughter was given a diagnosis on the first visit. She had the same abnormal blood work as before."

She spent 2 hours with us, and we were very, very happy. She was right on with her diagnosis, and gave several good options for treatment.

She is not a caring practitioner. It is all about the money. Your consult starts at $600 but by the time you leave the office you are over a thousand dollars in. No insurance is accepted. There is horrible follow up care. After your inital $1000+ appointment, she wants you to schedule a follow up. The staff does not give you an appointment as they have nothing available and say they will call you when Dr Taz opens up her schedule. Then they call you and want you to come in the next day when they probably get a cancellation. My husband and i both work so we would prefer if we could schedule our daughters appointment and not be at the mercy of a cancellation. We were also told by Dr Taz that we can always email her with any questions or concerns. Well i emailed her and then 13 days later i still had no response. My husband followed up with the office and we were asked to email again. I emailed again with concerns regarding lack of improvement in my daughters health. Once again no response. Finally frustrated i called and asked to speak to Dr Taz. Ofcourse she was too busy to speak to me. I asked when would she be able to call me back. I was told that the staff member would find out and get back to me. The staff member called me back and said that Dr Taz would call me back the next week. I am a doctor and if a patient asks to speak to me i call my patients the same day. Obviously she has no empathy or concern for her patients as she is too busy. SHE IS GREEDY. HER MOTIVATION IS MONEY AND NOT CARE FOR HER PATIENTS. "

Bhatia,Atlanta,Georgia, Pediatricians , Female,5,2.3,2015-06-08T12:30:26.742Z,2,1,1,3,3,Dr Bhatia seems to care at first but after your first visit you never seem to get any follow up care. It is almost possible to get an appt. and then you only get about 10 min of her time after waiting for over an hour. Her staff doesn't have a clue and can't answer any questions. Dr. Bhatia seems to be more interested in being famous than caring for her patients. Save your time and money for another doctor 
132,Dr. Tasneem H. Bhatia,Atlanta,Georgia, Pediatricians , Female,5,2.3,2013-10-19T14:44:19Z,2.5,2,1,3,4,"Dr. Bhatia seems like she has a little to much on her plate. If she recommends coming back in 8 weeks, I usually have to wait at least 10 weeks to see her and the appointment is not at a time that is convenient for me. The amount of time waiting to see her at the office is at least an hour, if not longer, and I only get to see her for a brief 5 or 10 minutes. She seems very knowledgable, but her staff is never on the same page as the Dr. They have called me to go over lab work and they can't properly answer any questions that I have. While I feel like there have been some improvements to my health by visiting Dr. Bhatia, the inconvenience (wait times, no available appointments, doesn't accept insurance) far outweighs everything else. Dr. Bhatia's practice seems like a trendy place to be, rather than a practice focused on patients."
133,Dr. Tasneem H. Bhatia,Atlanta,Georgia, Pediatricians , Female,5,2.3,2013-08-30T17:12:36Z,2,3,1,2,2,"Dr. Bhatia is overly stretched doing other things to be a true clinician and care about her patients. It felt to me that her clinic was more about making money, she makes a good deal of money on the testing that she recommends - much cheaper if you go direct. I did not get much specific advice for my condition - I think her advantage might be that she tests more than traditional doctors. The wait times were outrageous and disrespectful to her patients. Plan to take at least a half day or maybe 2/3 a day off of work for a routine appointment, this was not the exception, but the rule - 3 to 4 hours or more waiting for her. Staff were generally nice, and tried to be accommodating. Most of the people I know that used to see her are not going back due to high cost of testing and crazy wait times which don't outweigh the value of the care."
134,Dr. Tasneem H. Bhatia,Atlanta,Georgia, Pediatricians , Female,5,2.3,2012-08-13T11:32:32Z,4,3,3,5,5,"Dr. Bhatia is wonderfully warm, accurate, highly intelligent about all practices of medicine. She is a holistic doctor M.D. so she knows all about natural alternatives, but weighs it against traditional medicine. She's the best of both worlds. You have probably seen her on Dr. Oz or the Today show because she is constantly being invited on these shows to enlighten people. She diagnosed me with celiac when I went to three other doctors from Kaiser that couldn't figure out what was wrong with me even though they took x-rays and blood test. Dr. Bhatia gave me one blood test and the Alcat and diagnosed me on the second follow up appointment.My digestion has greatly improved and I am on my way to recovering beautifully.Her staff is young, slightly on the rude side, and always in a rush.They are nice enough, but I wish they were as friendly and calm as Dr. Bhatia. It's stressful enough to go to the doctor without being rushed from the front office staff. I wish they were more patient."

She does not take the time to review and evaluate your baby/child, she is a risky Dr for your child, she prescribed a very strong antibiotic to my baby even though I told her she had adverse reactions to her previous medication. Dr Alli would not listen and she has always been very agressive, **** and offensive. I went to another peditrician same day to have a second opinion and my baby DID NOT HAVE AN INFECTION, he told me those antibiotics would have been harmful for my baby. Even though her practice is always EMPTY, she would make us wait over an hour and just spent with us less than 3 minutes, very unprofessional. She becomes agressive and offensive when you ask her any question, she should not be called a ""Doctor"". If you love your baby/child, do not take it to this ""Doctor""."

She sat down on the bed and talked to her to calm her down because she was so scared. She smiled the entire time, went over treatment and home plan 3 times, amd was always within ear reach.

She didn't do a good job checking my child out. She talked to me very nasty then started ignoring me talking to her. She looked over & around my head... talking to everyone else except me (purposely ignoring me). She wouldn't even give me answers to my questions about my child's condition or get an understanding. When I asked her for her name, she refused to give it to me. I had to find out her name from one of the nurses. I took my child somewhere else immediately."

Dr Shayna Smith was very rude to me during my visit. She talked nasty to me and was short. She is uncaring, unsympathetic. It feels like youre just another number. She makes you feel like you're just someone to push to the side in a packed children's hospital. She refused to give me her name after I expressed my concerns for how she was treating me. I ended up having to take my little one somewhere else. I would advise any mom to advoid her by all means. When your child needs medical attention, you're already stressed, the most important thing to you is your child's health, and you don't have time to waste, choose someone else who at least acts like they care.

You need a doctor who cares about you as a person, and not just another case, one who listens and is respectful. That is where Dr. Johnson (at Piedmont Hospital) falls short.

Receptionis always frowns. You can hear through his walls very clearly. I am not trying to listen but there is no kind of barrier so you can hear everything, no privacy! Waiting room is very small and toys everywhere. I understand kids play but no one bothers to try and keep it tidy, at least not when I am there. I always have to ask him to wash his hands he never does. On a number of occasions he forgot to give me paperwork, prescriptions. You should hear how his staff talks to him, like he was a child half the time. You will hear them say, “do you remember Dr. Thomas we gave the parents this form but they still need this other form, you said you were going to fill it out, remember. His response is oh yeah and even when I get to the front he has forgotten again. Time for our family to move on."

She never did. Either she didn&#8217;t care (as she said she have TOO many patients to practice professional follow-up), or she just want to keep the patients money coming in while ignoring the real medical need (a pediatric neurologist). She constantly made us feel as if we were just another number that takes up patient apmt. slots. She view patient feedback as telling a doctor how to run her practice and as not getting along with the staff or dr.

So because we refused, he said that we don't care about our newborn and that we should kill ourselves. And he also threatened to call social services, essentially black mailing us, just so he could get more money for an extra visit. There's a special place in h@ll for people like this doctor Rabbat.
