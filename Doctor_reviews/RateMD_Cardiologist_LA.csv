10,Dr. Debra Ruth Judelson,Beverly Hills,California, Cardiologists , Female,10,4.1,2013-10-27T17:04:01Z,3.5,1,3,5,5,"Dr. J cared from my mother prior to her passing and she has cared for me since 2000. While her scheduling secretary Charley is extremely rude, the doctor herself is brilliant and caring and well worth the effort to get past the unpleasantness to see her. Dr. J. is a consummate pro and her office is equipped with the latest diagnostics and tech support staff. Highly recommend Dr. J!!"
11,Dr. Debra Ruth Judelson,Beverly Hills,California, Cardiologists , Female,10,4.1,2013-10-21T17:53:23Z,5,5,5,5,5,"A top notch doctor. Wonderful, caring, and very smart woman.. Takes her time to explain everything to you. Makes sure that you understand from the beginning what is happening. I will recommend her to anyone."
12,Dr. Debra Ruth Judelson,Beverly Hills,California, Cardiologists , Female,10,4.1,2013-07-30T13:07:09Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. J is one of a kind, my all-time favorite doctor. No, she's not the one to hold your hand when you're scared over a funny looking pimple, but she's a bulldog about finding and fixing the real problems. She's the one who knew I needed a pacemaker even though I looked healthy (unlike several doctors before her), and the one to order the CT scan that found my cancer at the earliest, curable stage. So, life saved twice, what more can you ask?"
13,Dr. Debra Ruth Judelson,Beverly Hills,California, Cardiologists , Female,10,4.1,2012-07-23T22:52:08Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Judelson is an extremely thorough, super smart and caring doctor."
14,Dr. Debra Ruth Judelson,Beverly Hills,California, Cardiologists , Female,10,4.1,2011-02-02T19:32:31Z,1,1,1,1,1,"After being a great patient for 15 yrs with NO problem ever on my part, I called Dr. Judelson's office feeling ill & chest pains & wondered if I could see the doctor that day. Charlie, her very rude and 'love to be intimidating' secretary ABSOLUTELY REFUSED to allow me to come in to see Dr Judelson because she said I had a $135.00 balance (I did not know about) that was clearly an error on the part of my insurance co! I was APPALLED that she told me NO, I could NOT see the Dr! After a 15 year relationship, & with great insurance that pays 100% & never made an error before! I thought she was kidding at first. I begged her, & said I would pay whatever she asked me to pay upon arrival at the Dr's office-even cash! (I had NO other Dr!) She flatly & arrogantly denied me seeing the Dr, telling me this payment would have to go through a special office that was closed at the time & would need 3 days or so to process, & that MAYBE I could see Dr. AFTER that was all done-no guarantee! WOW!"
15,Dr. Debra Ruth Judelson,Beverly Hills,California, Cardiologists , Female,10,4.1,2010-05-01T17:52:28Z,5,5,5,5,5,"really helpful, spent the time I needed and answered my questions"
16,Dr. Debra Ruth Judelson,Beverly Hills,California, Cardiologists , Female,10,4.1,2009-05-28T12:16:06Z,4.5,4,4,5,5,"Dr. Judelson is brilliant and caring. Her bedside manner is bit like Woody Allen, entertaining and perfect if you are very bright and educate yourself about medicine, but she can be cryptic at times. If you are an intellectual, you will love her and her technical competence is outstanding. I would say her approach to medicine tends toward following the latest studies, doing lots of tests, using drugs and treating conditions, which I like."
17,Dr. Debra Ruth Judelson,Beverly Hills,California, Cardiologists , Female,10,4.1,2009-05-21T01:50:08Z,4,3,3,5,5,"Dr. Judelson is the most intelligent, resourceful physician I've ever known. She's solved problems that specialists in other areas were unable to resolve. She is thorough and a creative thinker. She can find a needle in a haystack! I cannot recommend her enough!"
18,Dr. Debra Ruth Judelson,Beverly Hills,California, Cardiologists , Female,10,4.1,2009-05-19T14:03:22Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Debra Judelson is a brillant, wonderful and caring physician. My experience with her as well as her staff have been nothing but great. Dr. Judelson follows up on her patients, returns phone calls immediately and her assistant always calls in a timely fashion with lab results as well as taking care of prescription refills. Dr. Judelson is not a hand holding doctor and you will get the BEST medical attention ever. I recommend Cardiovascular Medical Group and especially Dr. Judelson."
19,Dr. Debra Ruth Judelson,Beverly Hills,California, Cardiologists , Female,10,4.1,2009-02-04T01:00:39Z,3,1,3,3,5,"From my experience, very smart and knowledgeable, but terrible personality...rude, cold, uncaring, haughty, egotistical and short-tempered. I found her to be very self-absorbed and practices defensively. If you want some understanding and comfort, this is probably not the doctor for you. If you are anxious or frightened, this is probably not the doctor for you. This is my opinion from my experience with her."

Has the right credentials, but they don't nearly make up for his office and bedside manner. Would I trust my life with him? Heck no!!!!

22,Dr. Charles D. Swerdlow,Los Angeles,California, Cardiologists , Male,12,3.88,2014-12-01T02:08:51.734Z,2,5,1,1,1,"One of the worst Dr.'s I have ever been to. Forgetting for a moment how he is as a human being, bedside manner, etc., this is strictly how he is as a surgeon. I was 32 when I met Dr. Swerdlow and knew I had a heart condition. He was so sure that I didn't need a surgery and I had to urge him to prescribe another heart monitor, so he could see more results. He called me two weeks later when he got the results from my monitor, which showed a BPM that peaked at 294. He immediately said, ""I'm wrong and you need surgery asap for SVT."" A few weeks later, as he did have the sweetest assistant who fit me in right away, Dr. Swerdlow went in to do the surgery and 3 hours later was unsuccessful. A good Dr. would have gone back in another time, but I think he was too scared and his ego was too big to say ""I failed!"" I asked when we could schedule another surgery and he replied with, ""you're fine."" He tried me on one beta-blocker which brought out Bradycardia and then gave me the advice in his office, in front of my parents to ""smoke weed,"" and wrote me off completely.
Since then I have had 3 more ablations by great, competent Dr's and am doing fantastic!
As far as I'm concerned his license should be revoked as he not only pays no attention to the Hippocratic Oath he is sworn by, but just does whatever he wants.
Worst Dr. EVER."
23,Dr. Charles D. Swerdlow,Los Angeles,California, Cardiologists , Male,12,3.88,2014-09-19T00:53:02.288Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Swerdlow is a brilliant and compassionate physician and surgeon. He saved my husband's life when he was in ICU going into shock at a hospital across town 11 years ago. His subsequent surgeries and compassionate care changed the course of my husband's disease and his quality of life. We moved to another state last year, and with Dr. Swerdlow's gentle assistance, we are slowly transitioning our care to a doctor he knows and respects. We have tremendous faith in Dr. Swerdlow and his excellent team of professionals. His entire team over the years has been and continues to be top notch. I would refer anyone in need of excellent professional care to him."
24,Dr. Charles D. Swerdlow,Los Angeles,California, Cardiologists , Male,12,3.88,2014-09-02T22:48:36.567Z,2,5,1,1,1,"I had a consultation with this Dr. today. He kept me waiting for 90 minutes. His nurse and staff repeatedly made excuses for him. There is no excuse to keep someone waiting for 90 minutes without explanation. I had to leave before seeing the Dr. His staff was very ""apologetic"". Unfortunately, apologies are useless when you spend 4 1/2 hours total with drive time waiting for a Dr. and never actually get to see him. There is no excuse for this."
25,Dr. Charles D. Swerdlow,Los Angeles,California, Cardiologists , Male,12,3.88,2013-10-21T17:47:34Z,3.5,4,3,3,4,"Good doctor.. But, horrible bedside matter.... I was in the hospital for 6 days.. Found out the reason for the stay.. but, he was very rude and at one point left the room without a goodbye, or I will be back.. Seemed very irate.. I was a patient in a hospital bed not really knowing what to do. And he left me hanging. Will not recommend him to anyone.. By the way. I have waited for him to call me to say sorry. And still nothing."
26,Dr. Charles D. Swerdlow,Los Angeles,California, Cardiologists , Male,12,3.88,2013-03-28T20:38:08Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Swerdlow is fantastic! I was treated by local cardiologists for almost 2 years before entering Cedar-Sinai and finding Dr. Swerdlow. Dr. Swerdlow gave me every imaginable test to determine my problem before recommending a pacemaker. He was able to go back and complete the procedure by implanting a pacemaker. Everyone in the hospital that day, from nurses to the Medtronics Rep, commented to me that they observed his work how lucky I was to have had him for the implant. I cannot say enough about Dr. Charles Swerdlow, his staff of nurses and technicians. Since I do not live close to Beverly Hills I have tried other cardiologists closer to home over the past 6 years and none come close to the care and support I received from Dr. Swerdlow and his staff. I would go back to him in a heartbeat even if it meant traveling 2,000 or 3,000 miles for his services. I would definitely recommend anyone with a heart problem to make the effort to seek him out and have him be your doctor."
27,Dr. Charles D. Swerdlow,Los Angeles,California, Cardiologists , Male,12,3.88,2012-11-17T22:29:33Z,5,5,5,5,5,Dr. Swerdlow is the best. The Medrontics cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implanted by Dr. Swerdlow three years ago saved my husband's life. We are so very grateful that he is Dr. Swerdlow's patient.
28,Dr. Charles D. Swerdlow,Los Angeles,California, Cardiologists , Male,12,3.88,2011-11-29T10:56:03Z,5,5,5,5,5,Outstanding Doctor. Thorough and very dedicated. He is tops in his field and I highly recommend him.

31,Dr. Payam R. Yashar,Los Angeles,California, Cardiologists , Male,3,5,2017-11-26T03:55:48.342Z,5,5,5,5,5,"I found him to be very kind and experienced. Was assigned to me through the ER at Cedars Sinai. As far as I'm concerned, he helped to save my life. Not sure about other review - he was out of network with my insurance but his office ulitimately worked it out where I paid nothing out of pocket. His office is wonderful. I am glad to have found him as my doctor."
32,Dr. Payam R. Yashar,Los Angeles,California, Cardiologists , Male,3,5,2013-09-26T15:12:58Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Yashar and his staff are terrific. I have great confidence in his knowledge of the field.

34,Dr. Kevin J. Drury,Los Angeles,California, Cardiologists , Male,5,4.4,2012-12-04T16:07:33Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Drury is thorough, knowledgeable, caring, helpful, modest, hard-working, and humanistic. He kept my father alive for many years through many difficulties and he explained the real meaning of DNR when no one else seemed to be able to do so. He never panicked but only made adjustments to medication and/or treatment. His only limitation that I can see would be to wonder how long he will keep practicing."
35,Dr. Kevin J. Drury,Los Angeles,California, Cardiologists , Male,5,4.4,2010-06-10T15:59:37Z,5,5,5,5,5,The Best! and he also cares. (I've used him for 5 years and he has seen me through a lot.)

He is very easy to talk to and he takes time with you. If it wasn''t for Dr. Lew treating my parent''s they wouldn''t have lived as long as they did. My parent''s just loved him and so do we. He has a good staff very nice."

His enthusiasm is contageous. Being a physician myself, I consider myself incredibly critical of other docotrs. However, Dr. Shapira is the ""best of the best"" (which means a lot coming from me). A visit to Dr. Shapira essentially guarantees that you will receive the best, most thorough care, while also feeling completely comfortable througout the experience. Simply put, Dr. Shapira is pretty darn spectacular."

If you go to him looking for answers then goodluck because you won't get any. I have now been diagnosed with 8 chronic illnesses, 2 of which have the potential to be deadly. I would not recommend him to anyone. I was very disappointed by the care i received from him since most of his patients can't stop singing his praises. He was a bad and neglectful doctor who's ego was too big to admit he didn't know what was wrong (but writing me off as a psych patient was totally acceptable in his books). If you have any form of autonomic dysfunction, or suspect you do, do NOT see him."

I went through heart surgery with him as my cardiologist. I have 3 different doctors caring for various medical issues. He has demonstrated a superb understanding of heart related issues. He's always prepared to take time time in explaining my condition and doing it in a layman's terms. Most notably, Dr Caren's probably my favorite doctor because his bedside manner is so compassionate. He is a doctor's doctor with a wonderful way of dealing with the ""heart""."

56,Dr. Jeffrey F. Caren,Los Angeles,California, Cardiologists , Male,3,4.83,2008-11-03T21:20:45Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Because my family has a history of heart disease, Dr. Caren is my primary physician so I see him at least once a year. He has proven to be extremely knowledgeable even in areas outside of his specialty, has a great bedside manner, and helped me to reduce my bad cholesterol by a whopping 50%. He is also an artist: a world class photographer whose pictures adorn the walls of parts of Cedars-Sinai Hospital. At Cedars, he is a long-time member of their Heart Institute. In my opinion, if you have cardiologic issues, you couldn't find a better doctor."

She told me that my pacemaker may be disconnected, which it was not! Then she left the room and never came back. I only went there to meet with her because I was looking for a new doctor. Not to be readjusted and scared to death. Even worse the office manager was completely unprofessional when I called to dispute my bill. She accused me of just not wanting to pay my bill within ten sec of talking to me. She wouldn't even give me her name, or let me talk to anyone else. This place is awful!!!!! Dangerous! Stay away!"
62,Dr. Olga Voroshilovsky,Los Angeles,California, Cardiologists , Female,6,4.04,2009-11-22T01:21:14Z,4.5,4,4,5,5,"she is an outstanding doctor. I have been having heart problems for the past two years and nobody could give me a formal diagnosis. I moved here in may and my pulmonologist and a different cardiologist recommended her to me so that I could get an EP study. I met her for the first time in september and 2 weeks later I was having the EP study done. She is extremely knowledgable and has outstanding bedside manner. She always answers my wuestions and if she does not know the answer right away she looks them up either right there on her iphone or she will look it up and call you or tell you at your next appointment. Even though I went to see her just for the EP study, I ended up choosing to stay with her and I do not regret my choice at all."

I was a nervous wreck (1st physical in years), he was relaxed & attentive. He spent over an hour discussing my history and concerns. Then called today to discuss my test results, and was willing to talk as long as I had questions. It's very convenient that he's also a cardiologist, because you don't have to go elsewhere for heart related tests/care if you need them. His attitude is perfect for worriers. While he recommended certain tests, he let me decide which to proceed with. Definitely aware of the mind-body connection which I really appreciated. Open to non-med interventions. Parking was $18. Overall my visit with him left me feeling very relieved, and very glad I finally have an answer for those forms that ask you to name your primary care doctor Highly recommend him!"

Such a difference from other doctors that make you wait forever to see them, then make you feel rushed. Dr. Cohen takes enough time with you to answer all your questions and concerns. He also has a unique style, in that he tries to get your whole body healthy... not just put a ""band-aid"" on the problem. He is really a great doctor and I'm not getting paid to say this! I would highly recommend him to anyone."

At first he was going to send me for a CT angio and then without any reason he switched the test to a regular angio which is a procedure. He told me that the reason was because my insurance didn't approve the test but my insurance said that the doctor cancelled the request. When I asked him about it, he was dishonest with me and lied to me about this. He was also in a rush every time I went to him. Also when I went to two other doctors, they told me that the test he wrote (angio) for my condition is unnecessary. I would not recommend him at all. Avoid him."

One time, I had to speak directly with the doctor about her (and make it a big deal out of the whole situation) just so she can ""re-"" send out my records in the mail that she had never mailed out in the first place. (Don't pee on my leg and tell me it's raining!) Also, there's an Asian (Chinese?) girl named Rachel who talks with a really rude, annoying and sarcastic tone.

134,Dr. Michael K. Cao,Napa,California, Cardiologists , Male,1,5,2015-02-10T18:05:45.915Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Cao is a specialist in internal medicine. I was referred to him by my family doctor a little over a year ago and have been very impressed about how well his office is run. Everyone on his staff is made me feel welcome and at ease about whatever procedure I was about to receive. I can remember the first time I entered his office and had to fill out the paper work that was needed anytime I see a new doctor for the first time. I have nerve damage in my writing hand and so I brought with me copies of all the information that I thought would necessary to fill out the required forms and when I told a member of his staff how illegible my hand writing would have been someone was there to help me through everything which made me feel comfortable already. Now I have been under Dr. Cao's care for over a year now I have come to notice how professionally his office is run. From the moment I enter his office I am always greeted by a member of his staff and I am made to feel like my care is of the upmost importance while I'm there. When it is time for my appointment they are always ready to take care of me. There aren't any delays as in other doctor's offices. He has enough staff on hand to make sure that I'm always taken care of properly. Everyone is there to see that you receive the best care while you are there ...... Now I know that is how a doctor's office supposed to be run, but actually so few are run that way! Dr. Cao is the person who I am sure is responsible for the professional treatment that I always receive when I'm in his office. If you are looking for a doctor who actually cares that you receive proper care then I highly recommend Dr. Michael Cao. if you are in need of his services...... Charles W. Hyatt"

Dr. Klitzner was her pediatric cardiologist during the months prior to surgery as well as in the succeeding months. He was and remains in my wife and my estimation a most compassionate, empathic, conscientious and knowledgable physician. We've felt tremendously well supported by his caring, open-mindedness and generosity with answers to any and all questions and concerns we've ever had. He's a gem!"

My teen found him cold, unsympathetic, and unprofessional. He blamed my child for his mistakes and told fibs to cover up his mistakes when he didn't really need to. For some reason, his other negative comments have been REMOVED! By him?! His agenda seems to be keeping his position at all costs. It's all about numbers and money with this guy. Avoid him! Yes, he went to a good school, but that certainly doesn't make him a good children's doctor."

Unfortunately, this is one of the worst doctors I have ever been to. He is arrogant and does not listen. His explanations for events and symptoms are conflicting and confusing. He is condescending in tone and content. He regularly cuts me off, impatiently holding me accountable for not understanding his poor communicative efforts. He rushes me through appointments and I rarely leave with a sense of being in competent, caring hands. But, the worst offense is that he refuses to involve himself in any dialogue or acknowledgement of heart-related symptoms he cannot explain. If I experience heart palpitations or other cardiac arrhythmias that are not reflected in my heart monitor, he shames me for “wasting his time” (a literal quote) and only begrudgingly offers suggestions of who might be able to help me instead. That’s if I’m lucky. Otherwise, I clearly have a “psychiatric issue” that needs to be examined. Right. So, if you can’t explain the symptom, the only other plausible explanation must be that I’m crazy. Ironically, he has all the traits of a bona fide Narcissist. (Note: I am not a licensed psychiatric clinician, but simply stating my personal observation.)
Continuing along these lines, he resents answering questions, feeling that simply telling me “things are fine” should make my terrifying experiences magically disappear. I have a very serious cardiac condition and I do best when armed with information and a comprehensive understanding of my situation. One time when I asked for an explanation for the difference between the cardiac condition I once had and the one it now progressed to, he said, “It would be beyond your comprehension, so I will not explain it.” More like, you must not have a very keen grasp of the situation yourself, if you cannot break it down for your patients. The man is insufferable and insulting. He creates an enormously hostile environment where I leave more taxed than when I went in. The bulk of his patients are senior citizens who do not speak English as a first language. I am comparatively articulate in English. I shudder to think what he gets away with regarding patients who may not be in a position to put forth their needs more assertively.
God willing, my insurance will cover me finding a better, more ethical electrophysiologist."

Perscibed a medication that would severely interact with the other medications I am taking. When we were leaving Dr. Shivkumar stood up and shook my husband's hand and said ""that treat many JPL scientists here?"" I was the patient and I am not a scientist. Then when I wrote a letter to them explaining my unhappiness over what was happening they dismissed me as a patient saying they could not meet my needs. These people only take the simple cases, Anything more difficult is way too hard for them. Also the nurse practitioners are acceptionally uncaring. Under no circumstances go to this place. Save yourself the trouble. You don't really see him any way. He is a sham artist! They kept on telling me different things when I called. UCLA Cardiac Arrhythmic Center is a REALLY REALLY bad place to go if you are having heart conduction problems and need real help!

My mother had just suffered a cardiac arrest and was induced into a coma, and she expected her to just get up and start talking to her. Well days went by when my mother began to respond to touch and familiar voices. Then when I wanted Choi to come by and check on my mom, she would sit behind the ICU desk for a couple of minutes and then just leave. She had the nerve to tell a cousin of mine that if my mother had been in her country she would no longer be alive (they would have taken her off the vent)."
