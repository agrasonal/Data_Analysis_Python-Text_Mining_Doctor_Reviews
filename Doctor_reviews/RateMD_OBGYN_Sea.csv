He made sure he came in during his weekend day off to be there for the birth. I can't say enough about this guy. We feel lucky to have been able to get him."
1,Dr. James A. Joki,Seattle,Washington, Gynecologists (OBGYN) , Male,10,4.7,2012-09-05T19:22:25Z,3.8,4,5,3,3,"UW Med is a factory setting, whether by his fault or the industries, it seems like women go through on a conveyor belt and you only get your set amount of time. On a personal level, I never feel like my health concerns are getting any attention. I get all of 2 seconds to express my concerns and begin to describe symptoms and I'm already given a diagnosis. It doesn't seem very personal or caring. I prefer doctors who will consider that my body may react to things differently and that I have logical concerns. I won't be returning to Joki anymore."
2,Dr. James A. Joki,Seattle,Washington, Gynecologists (OBGYN) , Male,10,4.7,2011-11-10T00:23:20Z,5,5,5,5,5,Best. Doctor. Ever. I don't even have words to express how wonderful he is. If he retired tomorrow I would seriously rethink having any more children. He made me feel safe and calm throughout my first pregnancy and birthing process.
3,Dr. James A. Joki,Seattle,Washington, Gynecologists (OBGYN) , Male,10,4.7,2011-04-15T17:22:04Z,5,5,5,5,5,"I can not say enough good things about Dr. Joki. I had a high risk pregnancy and Dr. Joki was recommended to me by many. My whole experience with him was fantastic and I would highly, highly recommend him to everyone. He turned a scary and bad experience into a wonderful experience and I loved my whole pregnancy and delivery because of him. I also know two doctors' wives and met many nurses in the hospital who had chosen him as their doctor and they all loved their experience with him as well. I am also very scared of pain and he basically eliminated the fear and the pain itself. I can't wait to go to Dr. Joki and his staff for another baby!"

Joki,Seattle,Washington, Gynecologists (OBGYN) , Male,10,4.7,2010-04-21T19:12:46Z,4.8,5,4,5,5,"i cannot say enough about this incredible doctor. he helped us get pregnant after multiple miscarriages and took amazing care of us all thru my high-risk pregnancy. i want to get pregnant again just so that i can see him again ;-)...his staff is amazing as well and truly care about you and what's going on. on several occasions, Dr Joki called in the evenings just to check up on me. i developed HELLP Syndrome at the end of my pregnancy and was in the VERY BEST hands with him and his staff and vast knowledge and also the support of specialists that he works with. everyone at NW always had the same thing to say when they realized he was my doctor ""oh we LOVE him"". his unique sense of humor, level of care and knowledge are unsurpassed and so welcome and refreshing. he knows to have you write things down while in his office since he is always going a hundred miles a minute! i would, and DO, recommend him highly and would give him TEN STARS if i could!"
5,Dr. James A. Joki,Seattle,Washington, Gynecologists (OBGYN) , Male,10,4.7,2009-09-15T14:58:48Z,5,5,5,5,5,"I expect to try and keep in touch with him and his office staff for many years. He delivered both of my boys and is going to deliver my next in March 2010. When I come for appointments I get a hug and a ""how's the family"". There have been a couple times in my past pregnancies where I had to go to the hospital for things that have happened. He doesn't even have to be on call, he seems to just always be there! I was sick a few weeks ago and he called me around 8 oclock on a saturday night just to make sure I was feeling better. I love this guy!! After my second son was born, he came in and sat down next to my husband and started discussing football lol I would and DO recommend him to my friends and family with no hesitation!!"
6,Dr. James A. Joki,Seattle,Washington, Gynecologists (OBGYN) , Male,10,4.7,2009-05-07T13:20:31Z,5,5,5,5,5,"I have been a patient of Dr. Joki's for over 25 years. He truly cares about his patients. When my oldest daughter was born 11 weeks prematurely, he came to see her at the UW Hospital even though he was unattached to the facility. He called the hospital to check up on her status until she was clearly out of the woods. I didn't even know about this until one of the nurses caring for my daughter told me. I refer him to my friends without reservation. If I could give him ten stars , I certainly would."
7,Dr. James A. Joki,Seattle,Washington, Gynecologists (OBGYN) , Male,10,4.7,2009-01-08T14:40:19Z,5,5,5,5,5,"I loved this Doctor. I can't say enough about him and his staff. He delivered my 1st of 3 boys(we moved for the other two)and it was truly the worst thing about moving from Seattle for me. He took very good care of me and even other issues I had at the time that I was having trouble getting other docs to help me with he bent over backwards to help me. He would call me at home on evenings and weekends to check up on me and was just fun to be around with his sense of humor. He's truly passionate and very knowledgeable about his work and patients and that's obvious in his practice. His staff was always kind and compassionate and knew my name from day 1. Personality wise, my husband and I clicked well with him and felt like he always tried to explain the what and why in the decisions he made and answered any questions we had. We have once again moved and I'm now looking for a new OB and having trouble because Dr.Joki is the gold standard to me and they are few and far between."

Seriously though, in my opinion he has a great, easy going sense of humor that I really click with and need. He can give the initial impression of being too ""quick"", because sometimes he does talk fast - but I believe it's just him thinking out loud. He is VERY thorough and highly believes in preventative measures, which is wonderful especially if you are in any high risk category. It may take some a little time to ""catch on"" to his style and quirky sense of humor, but you can tell immediately that he is really a caring and extremely knowledgeable doctor."
9,Dr. James A. Joki,Seattle,Washington, Gynecologists (OBGYN) , Male,10,4.7,2006-12-21T00:48:49Z,4.7,,4,5,5,"Dr. Joki delivered our second baby and we loved the experience with him. He is extremely knowledgable, though to some, might not have the best bedside manners. We really liked him and he impressed us with his level of caring when he would call us during evenings or on weekends to find out how I was doing. Because he works by himself in his own office and delivers almost 100% of his babies, sometimes he runs late. I would definitely use him again."
10,Dr. Heath Miller,Seattle,Washington, Gynecologists (OBGYN) , Male,19,4.31,2019-03-25T02:16:32.937Z,5,5,5,5,5,"16 years ago I was looking for a gynecologist and Dr Miller was recommended. He was my gynecologist first and then when I got pregnant, he was my OB. Over the years I have gotten to know Dr Miller very well and I would say, he is the best Dr in town! Not only is he super knowledgeable, but he listens to his patients (and I talk a lot!) and makes them feel heard. He truly cares about his patients and his work. Because Iâ€™ve gone to him for so many years, I feel like he is not only my dr, but he is a friend. I trust him because I know he cares and because he is truly an expert in this field. If you are looking for the best of the best, look no more, you found him! "

He presented my options in a concise manner weighing all the pros and cons, and I found him to be very practical. I was able to drive after 4 days! He has an excellent bedside manner and a brilliant sense of humor which is much needed during an emergency situation. I would not hesitate for a second to recommend Dr Miller to other women requiring (robotic) hysterectomies."

His expertise and his bedside manner helped me through a scary day. He also has a sense of humor. Great doc!"

I scheduled an apt with him and after waiting 45 min he came in and was disinterested with the pain I had. He requested I do an ultra sound and said he will call me back with results. 2 weeks later and 2 msg still no call. Ultra sound showed I have a hemoraging cyst and I have a lot of pain. I called his office and he was out so another doctor prescribed meds until he is suppposebto call me.
14,Dr. Heath Miller,Seattle,Washington, Gynecologists (OBGYN) , Male,19,4.31,2013-10-29T23:12:13Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Doctor Heath Miller is caring, very experienced, explains his diagnosis and medical options in a clear and understandable way and is an outstanding surgeon! I came to Doctor Miller for a second opinion as my original doctor told me that my fibroids are too deep for Laparoscopic Myomectomy and advised me a choice of either over invasive surgery or a surgery that is unlikely to cure my excessive bleeding problem. Doctor Miller inspected the ultra sound images and explained that Laparoscopic Myomectomy is the right procedure for my situation, he assured me that he has done it many times and my case is quite straight forward. . He scheduled me for a surgery 10 days later. The surgery and the recovery process was exactly as he described it. My recovery was very smooth. Doctor Miller called me at home to check how I am feeling. The incisions are very small and it looks like they will not leave any scar long term. I feel blessed to be in the competent care of Doctor Heath Miller and will always go to him as my OB/GYN doctor."
15,Dr. Heath Miller,Seattle,Washington, Gynecologists (OBGYN) , Male,19,4.31,2013-10-08T07:07:37Z,4.5,3,5,5,5,Back in 1994 when Dr. Miller was a resident at the U.W. he happened to be the doctor that was on duty when I delivered my daughter and he was incredible. The staff (mostly residents and interns) were making several mistakes and he seemed to be the only one that knew exactly what to do. 19 years later I still praise him. He made me feel safe in the middle of the entire experience.

As an older first time mom, with a history of fibroids, I wanted the very best doctor to perform the C section. I asked around the medical community and other doctors, nurses, radiologists and lactation consultants all raved about Dr. Miller. Last week, he delivered my healthy baby boy. It was only later that I found out how complicated a procedure my C Section turned out to be. I definitely chose the right doctor."
18,Dr. Heath Miller,Seattle,Washington, Gynecologists (OBGYN) , Male,19,4.31,2011-09-06T02:01:24Z,5,5,5,5,5,Best doctor I have ever had. Very personable and doesn't ever rush you. Simply the best! He has been my doctor for 13 years.

He is knowledgable, caring, compassianate. He makes you feel at ease,listens to you, never makes you feel rushed and if necessary he goes way above and beyond his way to provide you with the best care possible."

I was referred to Doctor Liepmann by another professional for a surgery and I felt blessed that he was my surgeon. Not only my surgery went excellent (with minimal scars that faded very quickly, my recovery has been amazing and I only took Tylenol for a couple of days). I felt like Doctor Liepmann has provided an excellent service with providing a lot of useful information in relation to my condition, communicating with my husband during the surgery. He went above and beyound my expectations by making sure I was going well after the surgery and even giving us his personal phone number in case of complications, which there were none. That's what I call a dedicated professional!"

Dr. Lieppman demonstrates such clarity in explaining information and such thoughtfulness and honestly when answering questions. He calls me to give me results, and insists that I call him whenever I have a question or concern. I have never experienced such a kind doctor or nurse. Karen, his nurse, was so kind and even came out to the waiting room to say hello before I went into surgery. I cannot emphasize how comforted I feel by the team. I am so thankful for his expertise and good instincts in finding something my last doctor missed."

Lieppman,Seattle,Washington, Gynecologists (OBGYN) , Male,6,4.79,2009-07-06T21:28:14Z,5,5,5,5,5,"I just can't say enough about Dr. Lieppman-he has been my physician for the last 10 years-he is very knowledgeable, really spends a great deal of time talking and never makes me feel rushed-he also has great bedside manner. Last October, my appendix ruptured, and I spent five days at Swedish recovering-I can't tell you how shocked I was when he stopped by to see how I was doing! He is the most compassionate and caring physician and I would highly recommend him."

He is very compassionate, and takes wonderful care of his patients. I have recommended him to several of my friends, and they have been very happy with his care as well. His nursing staff is friendly and well educated, they are responsive, and will give sound advice over the phone to the concerned pregnant mamma.

She was the first doctor to ever help me with my UTI problems. I ended up having to move away again which was about an hour away.

I wound up having a complicated pregnancy with hospital bed rest, and I found her to be very communicative and empathetic. I agree she can be a bit business-like, but she was always friendly and over the course of my pregnancy I found her to be a warm person. She delivered my baby via c-section, and I have a very small scar, and no complications from the surgery. Her partners and staff are top-notch."

I switched cuz I thought my previous provider (Dr. Levine) was not very thorough for GYN stuff (had been better at OB stuff). Sure enough, on my first visit with Dr. F., she discovered an enlarged uterus, (which likely was present when I had been seen at NW Women's Health?) She referred me for Ultrasound which confirmed a large fibroid. Although I'm glad she was more thorough, I am dismayed in the delay after the US. In fact it has been 8 days since the US, and she has not called me with the results (which the US radiologist told me directly) or her recommendations. Her nurse called on Day 4 (in response to my call), and then gave me bare minimum info, saying Dr. would call me back. Then I got 3 more calls saying that Dr. was unexpectedly out of office. it's been more than a week since the test, and no call from the Dr. I think I'll look for another dr. for fibroid treatmt."

I inferred about several problems I was having and she found one problem and did not search for any other reasons for the problems I was having. She rushed through my appointment even though I had waited for an appointment for five weeks. She did not seem interested or engaged at all. Also, her cell phone rang very loudly during my appointment...she took the call. It was her nanny. Other OBGYN's I've seen have always told me what they were doing, saying ""okay now I'm going to do this, or check for this"" but she gave me no warning. Wouldn't recommend her."

Until I was 58 I enjoyed relatively perfect health but in 1998 I experienced a cardiac arrest that I miraculously survived and then in 2004 open heart surgery was needed. So believe me I have had more than my share of Drs. and Dr. offices! I have become very selective of my Drs. in a time in this country that it is becoming more challenging. As an Image Consultant for 22 years I am pretty good at 'sizing up' individuals and it took two tries before I was led to Dr. Veljovich and his wonderful team. My care from the first appointment, through the surgery and now into recovery has been a peaceful experience with perfect results. With every surgery it takes ""informed Faith"" and there is always risk but with Dr. Veljovich he took me through it feeling confident in his skills. I could feel his care, his commitment to excellence and that he put his own ego aside and my well-being at the forefront. He is truly a gift to humanity and I am so grateful as I recover,
Blessings and gratitude, Dr. Veljovich - and all your staff. My cervix and my heart are happy tonight and thank you! Rachel W."

Veljovich,Seattle,Washington, Gynecologists (OBGYN) , Male,11,4.05,2014-07-23T01:06:23Z,4.8,5,4,5,5,"I sought out Dr. Veljovich for a third surgical opinion, hoping to take advantage of his minimally invasive expertise. He was quite honest in terms of what my options were and what his technological limitations were. I wound up with an open procedure and a large incision - certainly not what I had hoped for. That said, I felt complete confidence in Dr. V, knowing that I was in good hands if my fears of cancer and/or complications came true. That was a huge relief for me going into the OR. Office visits seemed rushed, and I was not very happy about that. Having spent my career in the operating room, I had more questions than he had time to answer, but at 7 weeks post-op, I'm happy that I had no complications. I'm grateful to have had an excellent surgeon to care for me during a very emotionally devastating experience."

From our very first consultation with him, he inspired confidence in his ability to deal with my health challenges. Despite a waiting room filled with patients, he took the time to answer all our questions and put our minds at ease. He met with my husband and me just before I was taken into surgery, and brought comfort to our hearts at that critical juncture. His high level of technical expertise, combined with his sincere compassion for the well-being of his patients, were major factors in the positive outcome of my case. In addition, everyone we came in contact with at Pacific Gynecology Specialists were sincerely helpful and concerned with our well-being. Without reservation, I highly recommend Dr. Veljovich to others."

As a registered nurse, I was very pleased with his knowledge and skill as well as his bedside manner. As top specialists generally are, he is very busy and your appointments are brief, but he will take time for any questions you have and explains things thoroughly. He did not remember the specifics of my case each visit, but I didn't expect him to with the number of referrals he handles. I accept the responsibility for being in charge of my health care. Once we started speaking and he reviewed my record, he would remember the specifics. He did a very complex 5 1/2 hour hysterectomy for me due to cancer using the Da Vinci robotics and I was up walking comfortably and able to discharge within 18 hours of leaving recovery. Impressive. And I did not experience any complications or infections. I was also very satisfied with his nurse, Heidi and Swedish Hospital where he practices."

Those doctors send you to Dr Veljovich because he is the best. He has been with me since day 1 of my cancer issues in more than one reproductive area. I have been a patient of his for over 4 years. There is no other doctor I would ever trust, he knows what he is doing and there is not words to express his compassion and knowledge. He truly cares about his patients- his assistant, Heidi is amazing too. I know that my health and my future are ok because of the care I have received from Dr Veljovich and his team. I'm due to have surgery again, and I know I'm in good hands with him. If anyone is being referred to him from another Dr be thankful, he truly is the best."

Although I moved out of the Seattle area a couple of years ago, I still travel back to Ballard for my Gynecological appointments because of the positive experience I have had with Dr. K. Dr. K takes the time to listen and provide wonderful guidance and I've never felt rushed through the appointment. I have never experienced an extensive wait and the office staff have always been genuinely pleasant to work with. Quite simply, Dr. Knickerbocker always shoots you straight, provides a comfortable and respectful health-care experience, and even adds a little humor to each visit. I have always felt that Dr. K truly cares about her patients and I have found her ""bedside manner"" to be just right. What more can a patient ask for? I recommend Dr. K for anyone looking for a wonderful Gynecologist in the Ballard / Seattle area."

She was the only one, after searching through many dr's that wanted to see me. I ended up having a c-section with my 1st (fetal distress). When I got preg. 17mths later, she had asked me if my religious beliefs had changed and if I was willing to accept a blood transfusion? I told her my beliefs had changed, but that I would really like, not to have one. She was very supportive and didn't object. She was pro VBAC, but as I approached my due date, I wanted another c-section. Once again, she was supportive and honored my wishes and scheduled the c-section. My son decided to come 2 days before the c-section and she let me decide whether I wanted to still have the c-section or try the VBAC. I had the VBAC and it went great! I am trying to get pregnant again and I will definitely be making the drive to go and see her again."

I'm sure that she has plenty of other people in rooms/waiting to be seen, but she always makes me feel like I'm her most important patient. She's never in a hurry to move on to the next person, and always has time for me and my questions :) I went in not knowing what I had after putting up with discomfort/pain for several months, and she diagnosed me as having a dermoid cyst, and advised me to get it removed right away. They were able to schedule me for surgery the following week, and it was so simple! She told me at my follow up appt. that my dermoid cyst was one of the biggest ones she'd ever seen! They said they removed almost 2 liters of fluid from it before removing it altogether. Yikes! My scar is healing nicely and looks great. Very clean job. If she were a general practitioner, I would go to her for all my doctor appointments! Thanks to her, I'm back to being a healthy 20-something. She saved my life.

Dr Mihalov is the best Dr I have had for this I have been to sooo many to help me with this and all they told me is I cannot handle pain. When I went to Dr Mihalov she told me we need to do a Laparoscopy to see what is going on I was diagnosed with endo. People with this need to know that it can come back fast or take years it up to your body. My pan is doing better then what I had beforeThe only way for your doctor to know for certain that you have endometriosis is by looking inside.

I took dr. m's suggestion and went in for a laproscopic pro. She said she removed ALL OF THE ENDO. By the way, they got me out of recovery so fast @ VM that I wasn't able to pee and had to go in for an emergency cath. I NEVER healed from surgery. In fact, i developed extreme pain 24/7. I had cramping and pain in my left ovary (the one she worked on) so bad I was bed ridden. She said that this was not her goal of surgery and didn't know what else to do. I ended up going to cali to a specialist. He said that my ovary was so BEAT UP he was shocked. He said, ""she needs a little more education in order to be doing surgery."" He said that the endo was stage 4 and that there is no way she could have removed it all. It couldn't have come back that fast, from the time of the surgery to the time I saw him. He helped me with 50% of the pain Dr. M CAUSED. I'm in my 20's and can't do anyting i used to. My life is very limited.I'm grieving my old active self"

Dr Wells was waiting for me at the drop off zone, took charge and knew exactly what to do. She and one other OB had my babies out within minutes of arriving at the hospital by ambulance safe and sound. She was my breech baby's advocate checking me right there in the drop off zone, getting me into the knees to chest position (yelling at the paramedics for having me in the wrong position) and getting me into the OR in minutes. Both girls came out great and she sewed me up perfectly with no further complications. She talked me through the surgery, was very caring, and came to check up on us afterwards.

I think she is a very smart dr, but I felt rushed in my appts. At one point one of her office staff told me she only could spend 10 min with me even though my appt was scheduled well in advance because that was the maximum amt of time Dr. Bridges had for every appt. In my first pregnancy, Dr. Bridges could not find my son's heartbeat at 12 weeks. The best the Polyclinic could do was send me home and schedule me for an ultrasound in the late afternoon the next day. The next 24 hrs was excruciating. After a post-delivery problem with my 2nd child, that Dr. Bridges couldn't find yet my current dr found in 5 min, I decided to leave. That problem required follow up surgery so it wasn't a little issue that would clear with time. Overall I think Dr. Bridges is smart & caring, but perhaps subject to organizational constraints on her time that impact patient care. Try drs associated with Overlake - you'll be happier."

She has a huge client base, so it's hard to get in to see her. She does the most thorough breast exam of any doctor I've been to. She is very calming. (I have a tremendous fear of doctors and she has never made me feel like an idiot because of this irrational fear.) I would definitely recommend her as your primary OBGYN doctor, especially if you are having issues."

Her staff however, isn't the best. Her LPN always messes up my blood pressure checks, which can be dangerous since I have hypertension. Her front-desk staff are rude high school girls who talk loudly about their daily dramas. I feel like this clinic and the doctor is quite impersonal, and I definitely feel like I am just a number... I've been going there for 7 months of this pregnancy, and they still cannot pronounce my name correctly. Aside from that, Dr. Bridges is sweet, seems caring, and is non-judgemental... not too mention being very well educated and knowledgeable. It is sometimes hard to get ahold of her or the nurse... it sometimes takes 2-3 days before they finally return my phone calls."

Now I really wish I had listened to all the warnings because they were spot on. Dr. McLennan was one of the worst doctors I've ever seen. Her bedside manner was appalling. She was arrogant, rude, and barely let me get a word in. It was very bizarre. I might have put up with it if she were a competent doctor, but she seemed insecure and contradicted herself many times. Needless to say, I do not recommend her. I found a new OB-GYN and my experience with the two was night and day."

I have a slight fear of doctors and avoid checkups and hospitals whenever possible but with it being my first pregnancy I knew I had to be tough. Dr. McLennan and her staff eased my fears and took excellent care of me the whole way through. I always felt she was concerned about me but more importantly, he health of my baby and every test/result was explained thoroughly so we never worried unnecessarily. I felt Dr. McLennan was extremely professional and will definitely be keeping her as my OB for our next baby!"

I went to her after suffering a bleeding episode in the first trimester with my fourth baby. She was very arrogant with both my husband and I. Not willing to answer questions or hear us out. The delivery was horrible as she kept trying to order more interventions without explanation. Finally, she went off duty and we ended up with Dr. Brown delivering our daughter! He was wonderful...I would highly recommend him as an OB."

I also had red blood everytime I went.I called the office right away and was told this was normal in some cases and continue to do my kegels. I came in at my six week and still had issues. Dr M reccommended I see a GI.All results came back normal.I went back to Dr M she said continue with kegels. I said the problems still persist. She said well things change when we have children especially with so many. I have lived with this disorder for three years I finally went back to the ob who delivered my first child and was diagnosed with a cystocele and rectocele. I want to have the surgurey and move on with my life.

I had had two miscarriages beforehand and was nervous about the pregnancy which required me to take several medications and had been labeled ""high-risk."" I saw Dr. McClennan many times. She was quick and smart, but I found her bedside manner to be very frustrating. There were several times I was told I was too anxious and that I would likely suffer from postpartum depression. When my husband came to an appt she ignored him completely. Two weeks before my due date she left WFHS and I became a patient of a different doctor. He was so understanding and accepted my anxiety as a first time mom who had had two losses. I couldn't believe how relieved I felt to have a doctor who respected me instead of telling me how neurotic I was. So... Dr. McClennan is not someone I would go back to see."

He answered all of our questions and acted like he had all day with us. He is a bit weird and I could see that horrible rating being true, but that's because that person just didn't get to know Dr. Gorenberg in the right forum. He is an amazing doctor and yes, does add humor to his work - that's probably what he meant in that previous bad rating. He is very knowledgeable in what he does and did my surgery flawless too."

My wife's condition placed us in high risk. He was the on call surgeon and I must say he performed absolutely superbly. This was a risky procedure navigating around large intrusive fibroids and he made it look like a walk in the park. It turns my stomach to read the other review of him. Based on how well he took care of us we sought him out for our second birth. Dr. Gorenberg saved her life and the life of my newborn. Our new son Max had his umbilical wrapped around him 3x in the womb. My wife's complications produced a severe blood loss. Dr. Gorenberg was extremely professional throughout. His quick but careful actions saved my son and my wife's. If you are looking for a seasoned professional then look no further. Everyone we spoke with at Swedish 1st hill said the same thing - we had the absolutely right person in the O/R that day! No one would ever be able to take that away. HE was the right man, twice!

Would NOT recommend seeing this dr for any reason. Dr's should handle medical information-esp.scary scenerios- with tact and compassion. Dr. Gronenberg did neither. In fact, he inflamed the situation with his tactless delivery. His last words to me were ""Sorry for all the drama, but I'm an OB. Drama is the name of the game."" That is most certainly NOT the sentiment that I wish for my OB to view his or her profession with. I am sorry that I had an encounter with him (the only reason I did was bc it was a rush medical procedure that I was having and he was the only dr available - and now I know why. No one would see this man when they had other options). He truly escalated my emotions when they did not need to be. The situation was stressful enough without him dramatizing them. I urge you to seek another dr if you happen to be faced with seeing him."

Going to her my experience is: she does not listen to the patient and tends to apply what has happened to her, to you. Even though she told me over and over that each woman'd body is unique and that she would listen to what I told her about my body and involve me in the decision making process, she didn't. She reversed herself repetitively on topics, decisions, and medications, always insisting that whatever she had abruptly changed her mind to was *best*. This included medication levels and treatments (I would leave the office believing I was getting a particular prescription and suddenly find that it was switched to something very different). She was pushy, aggressive, and dismissive. It may be that she is/was a good baby doc in some situations, but I would not recommend her to anyone.

Her emotional support and ability to remain calm in all situations, as well as her willingness to take the time to answer all of my questions make her a true treasure in my mind. I've never had a doctor who would personally phone me if I called into the clinic with a question, and I have had multiple phone conversations with her.

She insisted I have an epidural so that she could cut my cervix to promote dilation, all of which led to more interventions; forceps, vacuum, and the threat of C-section because I ""wasn't pushing well enough"".

She couldn't remember the ultrasound results from that day and told us she would let us know what they were when she came to see us the next morning. She never came to see us the next morning or the entire day. She said she would write an order for medication but never did. She later said she would have an induction scheduled for when she was on vacation but none of the on-call doctors would go along with her plan because they said it was not safe for baby or mother. She had my wife have an amniocentisis done so that an induction could be done the next day. My wife went through a painful amnio and was told she would be induced. The amnio was a complete waste of time, pain, & money because Dr. McDermott couldn't do the induction per hospital policy due to how far along my wife was in her pregnancy."

After two years of seeing her twice a year I started to notice she didn't remember who I was, and would tell me oh we'll do that next time, and I would have to remind her she said that last time. She was always late. I've waited for an hour or more everytime I go in. I was 15 minutes late to an appointment with her and I was her last appointment of the day and she wouldn't see me.

When we asked about the change in plan she got defensive and after a near-shouting match basically ended up saying ""because I said so."" She was condescending.

The surgery was successful, however, she did not explain what was going to happen or where my incisions would be. She also told me that part of the purpose of removal was to send the cyst to pathology to see what it was. At my post op she told me she had not done pathology on the cyst because she knew what it was; an endometrioma. Then she wrote in the post op report that it was a hemorrhagic cyst, not endometriosis. I am still trying to figure out which it was, but because she didn't do pathology, though she told me she would, I still don't know exactly what caused all of this. My new doctor said he post op report was vague and cyst should always be sent for pathology. I am not going to her again and I wouldn't recommend her to anyone else."

I was troubled about their diagnosis, and when I came back the next day to ask more questions, I saw Jenny who got very defensive, refused to answer my questions, and finally said 'nobody's perfect' and I was welcome to go find another doctor. She pointed out that Dr. McDermott hadn't even billed me for her time. I don't mind paying for a professional and I would much rather be charged for someone's time than left to an incompetent assistant. When I saw another doctor, it turned out that I didn't have genital warts at all.

From answering my many questions at the beginning of my pregnancy, to teaching me stretches to help prevent tearing, to helping aid in a wonderful labor experience.

He delivered my second and third children. Big difference between the doctor of my first and Dr. Agress. I was going thru a divorce during my 3'd pregnancy and would go in and cry each visit. He was very caring and compassionate. Has a great sense of humour. With my 2'nd pregnancy, I had begun with another doctor, who, when I started bleeding vaginally and wanted a note to stay home from work the rest of the pregnancy(working on my feet, lifting heavy objects, etc.)(had a miscarriage shortly before and was worried that I'd have another one) laughed and told me that if stress could cause a miscarriage then all teen moms would loose their babies. Left her and went to Dr. Agress. He said that if a woman felt that she couldn't work, he'd support her and give her a note. I also had had a C-section(1st baby) and had been told that I would have to have one all future pregnancies. Dr. Agress let me try and have a vaginal birth. Very patient."

In my opinion, he appears to be an excellent surgeon and is very well-suited to deal with emergency situations which one may encounter during labor/delivery. However, I felt that his bedside manner had something to be desired and I felt like my long labor was holding him from some other more important pressing matter."

I was considered high risk every time. she delivered my first child and my second pregnancy of twins while also training a resident at the time. She was out of town for my last delivery but called me the following morning to congratulate me.

I was seen by her throughout my pregnancy and found her to be warm, compassionate, knowledgeable, and up on current research and practice. She listened carefully to my concerns and was thorough in addressing them. The only downside, which she was very upfront about, is that she is a part of a very large practice meaning that, if they are managing your full care and you do not require a scheduled c-section or induction, any one of about 10 doctors could be the one on-call for your delivery."

I think I might be a few years older than her. I think she's a very young new doctor. And is timid. But there is nothing wrong with being young or timid at all.

She had an emergency and the staff instructed me after I was in the waiting room that she would be late, which was ultimately fine. I did have to get back to work for a meeting so had some time to wait and told the staff how long I had. I also asked if I should reschedule and was told no. When the Dr. arrived she was abrupt and seemed in a rush. She did my exam and without my query she started making recommendations for me to change to a new birth control and seemed annoyed by my questions and my desire to know more before taking on her suggestions (I have been on the same product for years with no problem). She left the appointment by telling me to set up an appointment for the product/procedure she was recommending. I was incredibly put off by our interaction - she was quite rude.

My other OB surprised me by leaving for vacation, but didn't tell me until 8 days before. I was not satisfied with ""on call"" options, as I was not given any answers when I asked about their twin or breech experiences, and I was not encouraged to meet any of them (there were only 4 others in that practice). I did not want to induce. SO I switched to a midwife the day of my labor, and Dr Dimer was the attending OB. Midwife delivered the first baby vaginally, and Dr Dimer did a SUPER FANTASTIC footling breech extraction of baby B, at 6 lbs-9 oz (bigger than Baby A). She was so calm, cool, collected, didn't interfere with my concentration. She allowed dim lights in the OR, a birthing bar, me laboring on hands & knees, and even Robozo positioning! An AMAZING OB!!!! I'm so grateful she works with this midwife, I could not have asked for a more experienced, calming, confident and kind provider. Thank you, Dr Dimer!"

I ""interviewed"" Dr. Norland and she was very upbeat and positive encouraging me that everything will be fine. I wanted to believe her. I had my annual with her and I asked to see the ultrasound of my ovaries. She blew off my request saying everything was fine. I finally went to a fertility doctor because I wasn't having normal cycles and sure enough I have PCOS and it's very obvious on the ultrasound. Dr. Norland didn't even look at it! Would not suggest seeing her if you want someone that's going to listen to you. Plus her nurse is not engaging nice or friendly."

When I tried to ask about labor preference at 20 weeks to determine if she is a good fit for me, she refused at first, saying it's too early to discuss labor.
When I told her I would like to avoid epidural as much as possible, she indicates epidural is the medicine to go and continue saying that is the appointments afterwards. I indicated I do not want IV put in the second in got admitted into the hospital, she went on and trying to tell me it is the standard procedure and it is ""just"" for easy access.

Oh! and her nurse, told me i had gained too much weight too fast - how much weight did i gain? 35 pounds total! long story short... Susan Harvey ruined my first pregnancy experience, and I will never 0 never! go back. She sucked."
180,Dr. Amy L.

And frankly, if she wasn't so darn good, I would have switched doctors a long time ago.
CONS
1) It is incredibly difficult to get an appointment with a doctor. They book out months in advance, and you'll often be directed to work with the nurse practitioner. As a non-pregnant patient, it appears to be even more difficult to get in with the doctor.
2) Be prepared to wait a long time. It gets busier and busier...my last couple appointments have resulted in long waits, the most recent was one hour, after which I had to leave and reschedule due to a work commitment.
3) It's hard to get someone to respond to you, over the phone or email, especially outside of office hours. There is no voicemail, unless you have an emergency. So if you need to cancel, change or request an appointment, this must be done during office hours over the phone, as there is no online scheduling capabilities. However, the office does confirm appointments via email. But they do not reply back when you respond to those emails, so don't expect to get a hold of anyone.
4) There's no cancellation list. So even though the office knows there's a demand to get patients in, they require patients to call daily to see if there are any cancellations.
Long story short, customer support is lacking greatly, with the exception of Rosalie the office manager. While I can understand being busy and in demand, it appears that some better systems should be in place and perhaps additional staff should be hired.
PROS
Both doctors are extremely knowledgable, kind and caring. If you actually get an appointment with them, you'll be pleased once you are in the room with them."

It was my first pregnancy and I was very upset as was my husband that we waited at least 25 minutes for her to show up to the hospital so I could deliver. When my daughter was born she came out blue and not crying. All the Dr said was "" It's normal, it's okay"" but nothing was explained to me and I was scared to death. She did not come back to check on me during my stay nor did she follow up once I left the hospital. I found a new OB and I am happy to be out of there!"

The last time I went in her nurse practitioner spent 20 minutes on her iphone trying to figure out facts about the birth control I was on. If you want to make an appointment with her be prepared to wait over a month. You will wait in the office well over your appointment time to be seen and this morning I've been calling since they open (8:30 and it's now 9:15) and the phone as remained unanswered. They don't allow you to leave messages either so if you have a busy work schedule good luck getting anything done on time. The staff is extremely unprofessional and I have yet to make even the semblance of a personal connection with anyone on staff. Overall her staff is careless and inconsiderate.

She has established a system where she is barely ever in the office, and her staff & nurses take care of most issues on their own. When you're pregnant for the 1st time, scared & confused, you need professional attention directly from the doctor. I ended up miscarrying with an ectopic pregnancy, and the staff was very unprofessional. They would forget to call me back w/my lab results & they would fail to explain risks in detail. I should say that Dr. V herself is incredibly knowledgeable and professional. However, she's barely around & you will most likely never deal directly with her. I stuck around until the pregnancy ended, but I'm going to a new OB now that we're trying again. Don't be fooled by her gorgeous office with an ocean view - I fell for it too, but in the end I realized I needed someone who cares about my health & will take the time to meet me."

She is patient, clear, and knowledgeable. Her staff is nice, but nothing spectacular hence the rating of 4. I've never had to wait longer than 5-10 min for my any of my appointments. When my son was born, Dr. VanBlaricom came in at 10:30pm on her day off to deliver my son! She was the rock that kept it all together. There was a nurse that was getting on my nerves, and I think she was getting on Doc's nerves too. But she kept her cool, and when it came down to the last leg, she took charge, got me to focus on her, and got the job done. I live 25 miles away, but it's worth the drive."

I come from a very conservative family and have a very conservative Husband and we were very upset that it was some male doctor whom we had never met or heard of before that showed up for my delivery. Even during my stay in the hospital she never showed up for follow up care, never even called, 2 other doctors hows up, both whom I had never even met before. There have been a couple times when I have showed up for appointments and she suddenly had to leave or the staff mistakenly forgot to call me to cancel the appointment the day before.

Her staff has been helpful and mostly friendly. Before she and Dr. Kroll changed offices, the wait time was ridiculous (3 hours +!) and has since improved. I do feel she spent little time with me while in labor and was disappointed my labor was stalled waiting over 30 minutes for her to arrive at the hospital. After switching doctors for my 2nd baby, I realized how much more time my new doctor devoted towards my pregnancy and labor/delivery. After delivering my 2nd baby, I felt like the methods used during labor with Dr. Vanblaricom were less effective and possibly contributed to my tearing and traumatic recovery. I did not feel supported post delivery. There were many things I wish she had told me in terms of how to take care of myself afterward that I had to learn the hard way."

Some of the staff could learn to smile and be a bit more polite, but the Dr herself is awesome. I recommend her to everyone looking for a new Ob/Gyn. She listens when I have questions and decides the best course of treatment for my lifestyle. I feel like she really cares and is interested in my health."

He never remembers you from one visit to the next, and gives the impression he does not have time for your questions or to explain things. If you're looking for an OB to be a good support system during your pregnancy, I suggest finding someone else."

She was warm, welcoming, took her time, and is totally reassuring. She makes you feel confident in sharing how you feel. Bonus is her assistant. She goes over and above to be helpful. She found out I was in the adjoining hospital doing blood work and came, took my 20 month old daughter over to the office and watched her so I could stay still and relax for the hour glucose test. "

It was my first prenatal appointment, me and my boyfriend were expecting our first child and we were both very excited. We got there 10 minutes early and i had all the paper work filled out in advance, so we waited and waited 20 mins later the nurse came and got us spent 10 mins with us going over history, and everything else after that we waited again for at least another 15 mins again waiting for our DOC she finally comes in she sounds like she is in a big hurry doesn't congratulate us on our pregrancy or anything very very rude she says she won't have time for an ultrasound today because she is running behind she threw a couple of books in our face and pretty much left total of 5 mins max the worse doctor ever. I have never seen anything like that, no one deserves to be treated this way there are a million doctors out there i left and never went back. She doesn't deserve to be a doctor no knowledge, no respect, and very irresponsible."

I literally had the exact opposite impression of her from some of these more negative reviews, which is actually why I felt compelled to leave a review. I found her to be thorough, gentle, and knowledgeable. She even took time to draw me a diagram/picture to help me better understand what she was explaining. I liked her so much I'm going to see her in the future as needed and I'll definitely now start seeing her for my annual exam. I thought she made an uncomfortable visit a lot easier."

Explained the issues and her response was I'm was just getting older and therefore going to have more difficult ovulation. Before doing any sort of exam I was made to feel that the pain I had been in was normal. I can tell you it isn't. After the exam she said I had a swollen uterus then asked me if I felt ""vindicated"". Next step she ordered a ultra-sound but told me this probably wouldn't show anything. Did ultra-sound and the results were in for two weeks and I did not receive a phone call after calling twice. Just wanted an explanation as the ultra sound showed two cysts. Her response once I did get a call back was it was normal. Maybe, it is but I'm definitely seeing a different doctor for 2nd opinion because I feel I can't trust this one after the complete lack of listening and help I received. I felt more of a nucence than someone in need of help."

If she thinks it is in her patient's best interest she will go out of the way to help. She calls personally to discuss the results and her recommendations with you. She has a calming effect on her patients and helps you understand clearly your condition and treatment. Her staff is congenial and professional. She screens your over all health and does a thorough physical. She has diagnosed and helped me with other non Gynecological conditions. Her experience shines through some of the simple advises she gives. She remembers you and treats you as an individual rather than a number. I would highly recommend her.

I'd had a bad experience with the OB for my first child, and he was terrific. He really made me feel that my input was important in the birth of my child. Most important to me, he had prayers posted in the rooms, but he also prayed with me. I'd never had a doctor do that and as a believer, that was so comforting. He was a true blessing. I miss him, but still go to that office because of the good experience with him, and I haven't been let down yet. He set the tone. I appreciate the work he did for me."

Dr. Judge was kind and thoughtful and very very caring of my and our son's well-being. She kept me comfortable and followed up several times during our stay at the hospital.

We both loved her immediately and feel so fortunate to be in her care. She was reassuring, calming, responsive, supportive, educational and funny in that initial visit and has continued to be so consistently throughout my pregnancy, delivery and post-partum care. One of the many things I love about her is her pragmatism and patient-centrist approach that is never judgmental or patronizing. I've recommended her to all my friends and even brought my parents to meet her. She's like a family member to us. I've lived in four of the top metropolitan cities in America and The Polyclinic is by far the best care I've ever received. "

I had planned a natural home birth with a midwife but had to find an OB when we found out we were having twins. She has been really great about being flexible where possible and very understanding so that I can keep as many aspects of my planned birth as possible. She takes as much time as needed at every appointment to answer questions or explain her recommendations. I have never felt rushed or pressured, even when I push back or disagree on what should happen. I would recommend her to any friend or family member looking for an OB."

She seems very put off if you come prepared with a question and answer list, and always seems to make you feel like you're wasting her time. She's very quick with her prescription pad, but is completely uninterested in doing any diagnostic work before prescribing medications. I tried to push for more answers, and more diagnostics, and she released me as a patient in the middle of a medicated infertility treatment that was very time sensitive, leaving me unable to complete the treatment without starting all over. Last year, when I found out I was miscarrying, I had a (small) bill outstanding with the office, and she wouldn't even see me. If you don't have great insurance, don't even bother. If you're self pay, be prepared to be treated like a welfare case (even if you pay at time of service)."

Dr. Hitti takes the time to listen and answer all of your questions and never rushes you so she can go on and see her next patient. Her nursing staff is patient and always willing to answer any questions or to go the extra mile for thier patients. If you have had difficulty in maintaining your pregnancy (ies), Dr. Hitti is your physician. She does run a little behind every now and then but she's worth the wait.

I was completely taken aback by this as it was obvious that she was trying to milk my insurance company! She is VERY pushy with trying to get you to take other tests that you need to pay for - even insisting that I must be anemic because i am vegetarian! Totally ridiculous!!

I begged her to tell me and guide me through the delivery process and she said that if I knew how to get gregnant, I should be able to do the rest on my own. I found it to be rude and unprofessional. Yes, I did have a child at 4 am, but she did sign up for the job and not only for scheduled C-sections. I heard she's a good surgeon and I probably would have a better experience if I was heavily sedated. I can't comment on her bed side manner as she never visit me after birth.

He commented twice, that my baby was quite active. Luckily I remained calm and still, and just took slow semi-deep breaths, but it was alarming. When I called a different hospital to ask if my experience was normal, the nurse I spoke with assured me because of the two dimensional nature of ultrasounds, the needle could appear close but isn't - then how does one know where the needle is in relation to the child's head? Why use an ultrasound in the first place, if it doesn't provide guidance? The procedure didn't feel right at all!

Wolff,Seattle,Washington, Gynecologists (OBGYN) , Female,1,4.5,2014-04-23T19:25:36Z,4.5,5,5,4,4,"Very friendly and informative doctor, and overall great experience except for two minor issues with my IUD insertion. I agreed to have a new MA sit in on the procedure and because of that, the most painful part, sounding the uterus, took about 3 times as long as necessary. After 5-10 seconds of extremely painful cramping, Dr. Wolff announced that my uterus was 7cm, and then she left the instrument in for another tortuous 30 seconds while she showed the MA and explained it to her. Second issue was that I'm terrified of needles, and had not previously been aware that my cervix would be injected with lidocaine. I read later that this is not generally considered to help much, and I think that if Dr. Wolff knew that my vision started going black around the edges when she mentioned the injection, we may have agreed that it wasn't necessary. Unfortunately, there was no break in her discussion with the MA for me to bring this up, so an already unpleasant procedure was made much worse for me."

She was my OB throughout my second pregnancy. She is extremely bright, knowledgeable, warm, funny, and sincerely caring. I looked forward to all my prenatal visits with her, not just to get all my questions answered, but also for a chance to visit with such a terrific person. She is non-judgmental and supportive -- she will handle your pregnancy and delivery the way you want things done. She is respectful and authoritative without being condescending. I wish all doctors had her interpersonal skills! Her nurses are also very helpful and kind. She did not handle my delivery (I gave birth the one day of the week she has off) but she also did a wonderful job with my postpartum care. I can't wait for my next pregnancy so I can hang out with her again! Her front desk staff is a little distant and flaky, and I noticed some turnover during my pregnancy, but the people who work there now seem better."

I feel like she is actually thinking about what I have asked her...and she wants to find the answers. She is hard to get an appointment with...very booked up. But so far she has been great. I am 6 months pregnant...so I have booked my appointments well in advance. One thing she did that was nice, was that I had a major health issue while she was away on holidays, I did not know this and kept getting referred to the on-call doctor...But once she was back she called me asap to let me know that she had just seen all my new information...I really appreciated that!"

The nurse said this was the first time in 18 months she'd seen him that far behind. It was because he had been in surgery all morning and it ran long. He was very thorough, and was able to find and diagnose my issue with ease, unlike three previous providers."

She was friendly, prompt, kind and knowledgeable. Unfortunately dealing with the office was a nightmare. I raised three biological children and three foster children. So, I know my way around a medical office. My foster children had Cal Optima. Cal Optima was far easier to navigate than Dr. Tiffany Beck's office. These are some of the issues with the office.
- The website was down prior to surgery and is still down today.
- I was not notified the insurance approved my surgery prior to the surgery. I called dozens of times to find out. I even camped out in the office. Both my husband took of work and we set everything into play. We showed up for surgery not even knowing if it was going to happen.
- The e mail of my contact person was down. I tried over and over and over again. The person blamed me for days. Than after surgery she admitted it was her e mail.
- The voice messaging system of the person I was supposed to deal with was down. There was no way to leave her a message and I was not allowed to deal with anyone else.
- I attempted to make sure all the blood work I needed was in play for surgery. No one would return my calls or answer my questions. The doctor did finally get back to me 38 hours before surgery.
- I attempted to get a letter from the office to freeze my gym membership and postpone travel. I have called for the last five days as well as before surgery. I just received a note with no letterhead or proof of where it was coming from.
I liken my office experience to that I would receive in a third world country. Dr. Tiffany Beck OBGYN Oncologist is an excellent surgeon. If she solves these office problems, I can see her having a successful practice. "

I would NEVER recommend her!!! She used to be a good provider a few years ago, I do not know what happened to her, but she acts like she does not care at all about her patients, how they feel, emotionally or physically. If you are looking for a good OB/GYN she is not the one. I am terrified of men OB/GYN's I will go to a male before her!!!! Seriously!!!"

I was pregnant with my first and thought that she would be a great choice since she had such a wonderful experience. I was wrong wrong wrong!!!! She couldn't of been more the opposite for me. Lets say this.. I had to have a emergency c-section and was scared. I had never had surgery before. I had said please do what ever it takes, just get him here. When I was crying when I learned I had to have a c-section she look at me and my Husband and said ""I don't know why your crying, you said you'd do what ever to get him here."" Nice... Then the surgery went BAD! I felt the surgery! She treated me like I was just a complainer. I've since had two more children. NOT with her. My sister is still her patient. I'd say she is smart but her bed side matter in a scary situation lacks SERIOUS compassion. I would NOT recommend this doctor.. to anyone. My opinion."

Dr. Fuller is knowledgeable and communicative without being patronizing. She speaks clearly; she always checks to see if I have any questions; she explains what she is doing while she is doing it. I really appreciate that she can talk about gyn-related matters directly and without judgement. That's much rarer than it should be in the OB-GYN field. I've seen Dr. Fuller through a series of difficult issues and a series of regular exams. She's just as attentive, compassionate and approachable in either situation. My only wish is that her front office was staffed a bit better as it can sometimes be time-consuming to make an appointment."

Before having a procedure done, I checked with my insurance provider carefully to make sure it was covered. It was, but during my procedure the nurse asked me if I wanted something to make me comfortable during the procedure.

Once Dr. Tronnes arrived after 3 hours, she was rude, abrupt and cold.Most distressing was how accusatory she was, indicating that we had waited too long to report our concern and rolling her eyes when I explained why I had only recently been alarmed by the issue.She was condescending to everyone around her, especially the kind nurse that had worked so hard to make us feel at ease.When testing determined the issue, she gave us a printout explaining what could be done, but her verbal advice conflicted with the information given.Given a choice ladies, avoid this doc."

I had a rough morning with testing at the hospital, and another mfm telling me I would be admitted over the weekend. Then, when I met with her, it honestly seemed like she couldn't have cared less about our situation, and she was very dismissive. My husband thinks we should look at it as her being optimistic, but when three out of four people you deal with in the day say you should be admitted for constant monitoring, and the fourth sends you home without even a follow up appointment (or a goodbye, for that matter) it definitely rubs you the wrong way, and is so confusing. I asked not to see her again, good thing the mfm group has a lot of others to see. Could have been a bad day, but it's no excuse for bad manners."
