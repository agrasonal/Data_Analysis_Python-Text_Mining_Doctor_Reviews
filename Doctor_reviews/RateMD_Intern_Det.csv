Neisch,St. Clair shores,Michigan, Internists / Geriatricians , Male,7,4.5,2013-04-02T12:15:15Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Very good doctor, who spends adequate time with you and doesn't talk down to you. Careful in recommending further diagnostic testing - doesn't order tons of unnecessary tests, but looks further if he has any concerns there could be an actual issue. No issue getting quick specialist referrals (as long as the specialist is in his hosptial network, not the HMO network as a whole - THAT I don't like). You never wait long in the waiting room, either."

I've seen several other doctors in the recent past who didn't know what to test for in order to determine the cause or best treatment for symptoms. He has a much broader knowledge of metabolic and endocrine disorders. I sensed he really cares about seeing me recover."
26,Dr. Rick D. Saier,Clinton Township,Michigan, Internists / Geriatricians , Male,3,5,2010-09-03T19:05:15Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Saier is a rarity these days. He spent plenty of time doing the initial physical, transcribed all his notes and gave me a copy and sent me for tests that were very beneficial. He even called on the phone to give the test results and a course of action. On subsequent visits it was obvious that he had carefully gone over my records and made notes before entering the examining room. His demeanor is friendly and respectful and he has great empathy for older patients or those with disabilities. I would highly recommend this physician."

I was referred by a friend & my first visit went great. Second not so much waited 1 hour to be seen & was actually told when I was telling her my concerns that she has a couple more patients and I can wait til she sees them and asked the rest of my questions but my time is up! Are you serious! She pushes medication you don't need. Never returns calls, fills scripts unless you go in or sends referrals when she says she will. Needless to say i am looking for a new doctor!"

Also, you never see the same doctor for the same problem which ultimately results in important details of previous care being missed.
I have found another physician practice ---- and very happy with the switch."

Caren,Detroit,Michigan, Internists / Geriatricians , Female,12,3.56,2013-09-09T17:35:47Z,1.8,1,1,2,3,"I've been taking my children to Dr. Caren, and Brenda Pope, for a number of years. After my son's appointment today, we will never be back. As I read in previous reviews, I agree with the last couple. I pulled my son early from school for his 3:20 appointment. After waiting, and waiting, and waiting, Brenda finally came in at 4:45. I've given this doctor's office numerous chances. This was for a prescription refill! No shots needed, just a few questions and checkup. I am beyond disappointed in the lack of compassion the staff has as well. I than went up front to pay my co-pay. Stood there waiting for a receipt, and 16Â¢ change. Kathy sat in her chair, back toward me, and after waiting for another 3 minutes with either of those in hand, I walked out. They even have a sign up saying they are taking new patients. WHY? They can't even see the patients they have. I can't waste anymore of my time with this practice. You shouldn't either"

She never makes assumptions and listens intently to her patients. I would never EVER advise anyone to EVER under any circumstances see The Pope (Brenda) she is rude, unprofessional, inconsiderate and too big for her britches. Dr. Razook is ok as a sub for Dr. Caren but I wouldn't have her for my primary care."

I believe she truly cares.She has never pushed any pills on me. The only downfall is her staff, they are the worst Ive ever had to deal with. Oh and the Nurse Practitioner there is terrible, she is rude, I have a couple other names for her but they might not let me post this. Dr. Caren does vacation a lot and take time off but if you can get past her dumba** staff she is a great doctor."

She has been my doctor for 9 years (moved away for 4 years) and she remembers everything about me and my family. Bedside manor is great. I don't know why the other patient said she was a pill pusher..there have been many times where she wants me to ""ride it out"". She truly cares about her patients as individuals. I don't care for the front desk people though."

I have been a patient of Dr. Carens for neatly two years now. I was referred by my friend whom had been her patient since birth and obviously did not know how doctors should treat their patients. Dr. Leslie Caren is a pill pusher. That's all. Numerous times I have gone in to see Caren and have waited 45 minutes or more in the waiting room only to wait another 35 in the back room. Several times I have had to see another doctor because Dr. Caren decides to take vacations and spontaneous days off. If you're a new patient they get you in right away, but if it's your second visit or more FORgEt IT! They stop caring about you. It's all about the money. If you're looking for a great doctor I reccomend Dr. French at Clarkston Medical on Bow Point Drive off of Sashabaw. Thats where I have switched and she is fantastic! Has actually resolved my issues without pushing brand meds that pharm companies pay her to push, which Dr. Caren is currently being investigated for."

Two cause a person to not think clearly, which is wrong for a person with early dementia. The doctor was rude to my grandfather. He refused to listen to my concerns about interactions between drugs. He was rude to me. He refused to take responsibility for a drug that could be dangerous with low blood pressure (which my grandfather now has), saying ""he didn't prescribe it.""

If you have a cold or a cough and are in a hurry, see one of the other doctors. If you want you heath managed, monitored, and actually cared about...see Dr. Meyer. The wait is longer because she spends a lot of time LISTENING, TAKING NOTES, AND LOOKING AT YOUR HISTORY. Duh. If you want someone to kiss you and tell you you are all better, go see your mommy. If you want an excellent, thorough, intelligent doctor, go see Dr. Meyer. "

Meyer,Detroit,Michigan, Internists / Geriatricians , Female,17,3.25,2014-08-20T00:42:02.710Z,2,3,1,2,2,I was stuck in the exam room for well over two hours after my scheduled appointment time. Once the doctor finally made it to my room she was very disrespectful and essentially told me I was lying about my symptoms and pain. Needless to say I was very upset by the appointment and the treatment I received here.
83,Dr. Christine M. Meyer,Detroit,Michigan, Internists / Geriatricians , Female,17,3.25,2014-01-29T08:32:14Z,3.8,4,1,5,5,"I have been seeing Dr. Meyer for many years. While she is chronically late I believe it is because she spends as much time with each patient as they need. If I want to get an extremely thorough exam I see Dr. Meyer. If I am rushed for time I see Dr. Varghese. Get a first thing in the morning appt if you are time short. I find her bedside manner somewhat refreshing. For those that comment that her bedside manner is rude, I don't see it. I try and engage her in some humorous comment and she can be quite friendly and enjoyable. She is the best general practitioner I have ever been to. She has a very keen mind and remembers her patients conditions and previous treatments well. For anyone that wants the best treatment and fully researched answers by all means see Dr. Meyer. If you are only concerned about time then see someone else. My health is worth the wait for an outstanding Doctor."

An average wait is between 1 1/2 to 2 hours! When I'm sick I don't feel like waiting that long. She has a poor bedside manner, is rude and often makes comments that are insulting. She is thorough on her exams and tests but that does not excuse her poor time management and lack of consideration for her patients. I would not recommend her to anyone."

I do not normally see Dr. Meyer unless she is the only doctor available. I think it is odd to say that she is ""quirky"" with her bedside manner because quite frankly, she is rude, disrespectful and scarcasic. If I am going to the doctor, it is because I don't feel well and it is not acceptable for a doctor to make me feel worse when I come out. I normally see Dr. Woelke and my husband sees Dr. Plaffy. I find these doctors provide exceptional care, are respectful, and I don't wait hours to see them. Bedside manner is important to me and if it is important to you, I would definitely recommend you see one of the other doctors at Waterford Family Physicians and stay clear of Dr. Meyer."

She is thorough and leaves NO stone unturned. Yes, her bedside manner may be a bit quirky but she is listening and is very focused so she may seem rude. If waiting is a problem, see her first thing in AM or right after lunch. She spends the time with you that you need and her mind is always working, hence the wait. I feel she is worth the wait for the attention she gives her patients."

Meyer,Detroit,Michigan, Internists / Geriatricians , Female,17,3.25,2011-07-17T14:16:56Z,2.8,3,1,3,4,"I saw Dr Meyer 1 time, her partner 1 time, and left the office without seeing her the 3rd time. The first time I waited about 1 1/2 hrs to see her. She was thorough with her exam but does have a quirky bedside manner. You don't get the feeling of warmth and caring from her. A week after my appt, she did have her assistant call me about some abnormal blood work and called in a RX. The second time I was having ear problems and saw her partner and waited about 2 hrs. The waiting room was not even full. I recently scheduled another appt with her and after 1 1/2 hrs waiting, I walked out. She did send me a form letter with an apology and a $5 gift card. I don't plan to go back to the office. I don't think my waiting time is abnormal and I don't want to see a doctor who does not value my time."

She will take as much time as necessary to fully explore your concerns, which is why she runs late. If she doesn't know something, she'll admit it and do her best to find the answer.

I went into the office scared and feeling miserable. He wanted to run tests which kept me in the office longer. He was so wonderful to personally check in on me numerous times! It made such a difference. I immediately went home and switched him to my primary care doctor. After I left I had questions regarding my test results and he was prompt at returning my call and explaining everything to me!
100,Dr. Suja Sukumar,Detroit,Michigan, Internists / Geriatricians , Female,2,4.5,2012-03-27T08:49:53Z,5,5,5,5,5,"I appreciate her because she was the one to discover I'm prediabetic. I'd just had blood work done w/another physician who hadn't spotted it. However, during the initial examination I told her I wanted to lose weight. She responded, why. I'm African American. Perhaps she was thinking that you look okay in comparison to other women of your same culture. But that wasn't the point. I knew I'd just gained all this weight after being newly married. I think due to the weight gain I'm now prediabetic. I wanted her for my doctor. I was looking for a doctor. She seems to be a little defensive. With time she may gain confidence thereby alleviating the need to defend. As I said, I'm glad she discovered my prediabetic state."

Wasn't very knowledgeable about my specific condition so wasn't very helpful. She also ran a test that, although inexpensive, could never have yielded what we were looking for. If she had leveled with me and told me the truth---that there are no tests for my condition---I would have more respect for her. But her not telling me suggests that she didn't know. I would look elsewhere unless you have a very general problem."

She's helped me through many illnesses and injuries. She's caring and kind but also tough when she needs to be. She's always listened and taken into account my feelings about my own medical treatments. I don't care that the initials after her name are PA! I just wish she had more control over the office and other Docs that you may be referred to. I've recommended her to friends and they love her too! For those who think the PA means she's less of a doctor in some way... you have a lot to learn! This young lady really cares about her patients and I'll take a caring PA over a way too busy DR any day!! Everyone on the staff I've had contact with have also been great and I totally agree about the vampire lady, she does an excellent job, no pain and no bruising when she takes your blood. Same day appts are available most of the time as well. You may wait a little longer some days but I feel its worth the wait!!!"

After I described my array of symptoms, Dr. Bhan's response was that she didn't know why I was having all of those symptoms because synthetic thyroid meds should solve everything. She also said that there were no other tests she could run, and that I should stop ""chasing it"" because there are some medical mysteries that cannot be solved. Needless to say, I was shocked. I will never give up my 'chase' to feel better, for the sake of my own well-being and for my 2-yr old daughter who needs a healthy mom around. Any doctor who gives this advice is obviously under-educated and not interested in their helping patients."

She SCREAMED at me, ""DIZZY or FAINTED?"" Several other dual questions were screamed at me. She referred me to a gynecologist for a condition. When I saw the gynecologist, she said I didn't have the condition and didn't know why I was sent there -- everything was fine!

Nearly 5 months later with her go to diagnosis that my body was traumatized and swollen and that I needed to give it time, she then encouraged me to buy massages off of Groupon because that’s what she does. I was fed up. What was happening to me was real and this Dr clearly was not taking me seriously. Immediately I got a new Dr. MRI imagining came back showing that I had sustained injury to my lumbar spine, my right knee, my right foot and the worst of it all was the damage to my right hip. Had this woman taken me seriously further damage would not have occurred to my hip. I have undergone several surgeries to repair the damage I sustained.

The specialist I spoke with after getting my test results from Dr. Narang, was shocked and so disgusted with the way this doctor handled my case that they are going to look into doing something and though I have not filed a official complaint, I feel the best thing I can do for anyone considering becoming a patient of this doctor is to write this and warn you that this man is not someone you should trust with your healthcare. I am not the type of person to make a fuss or complain however nobody should go through what he put me and my family through and if this review prevents even 1 person from having to be treated the way I was, than the effort was well worth it. Shame on this doctor. He caused so much unnecessary pain, forgot before going on vacation to call to inform me about very important test results and then allowed his staff to tell me I had a disease that cannot be definitively diagnosed with the test he performed. Thankfully I was able to find a wonderful doctor, trust me, steer clear of this doctor."

Gives you 15 minutes of time after long wait. Very de-grading and unhelpfull. Refers you to testing and specialists with no follow up. Medical problems go unresolved for months. Staff very rude and bigots. Schedules four patients for each time slot.Exceeds recogmended course of scipts then cuts you off with no warning, and problem still not resolved. Get definite impression she doesn't want to be there."

And as she is off teaching at Wayne Sate, attending seminars, writing articles and doing talk radio, she has no time for you anyway. Find a doctor that wants to help you. If youre going to be a star on her forehead, then go see her. If your cancer is more serious, find some one else. She refused BF every kind of treatment out there, and he wanted treatment. He died horrible death from untreated cancer. Sorry BF ever went to Karmanos, and sorry he ever met Dr. Wozniak....."
