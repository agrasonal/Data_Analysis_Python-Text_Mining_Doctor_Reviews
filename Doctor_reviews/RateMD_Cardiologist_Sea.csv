I established care with UW Medicine and was referred to Dr. Pungoti for my cardiac care. I was very impressed at how thorough he was in reviewing all of my previous medical records, and actually explained what happened to me better than my previous doctors. He ensured that I was on the right medications and doses. We talked about my diet and he gave me some great exercise recommendations. He didn't order any unnecessary tests, which was very much appreciated as I have a high deductible. Overall it was a great experience. His staff was also very nice."

No question is out of bounds and takes the time to answer them. I have been going through pre-op screenings in the last 2 months at different clinics. Dr. Pungoti stands alone in his dedication to his patients. I know first hand as I am one of them! I'm lucky to have him as my doctor!"

But most of all she really knows what she's doing. She saved my life. She is committed to healing and research and shows that she cares about you as an individual. I recommend her without qualification. She is also very highly regarded by all of her peers. They all speak of her kindness and extreme intelligence. She has great bedside manner and a warm smile."

Holmes,Seattle,Washington, Cardiologists , Male,2,5,2010-07-29T22:18:35Z,5,5,5,5,5,Dr. Holmes helped saved my life about 15 years ago - he discovered an aortic anueryism (sp) that I had surgery on 15 years prior that was bulging and in a near rupture condition. His diligence in treating me and watching this condition helped set up an emergency surgery at Virginia Mason Hospital. Great Heart Doctor - Thanks Dr. Holmes

Asked 8 questions of which 6 could be answered if he bothered to read my file. Then said to see him in a year. Ran no tests, nothing. He seemed arrogant and I was wasting his time.

16,Dr. Christopher L. Fellows,Seattle,Washington, Cardiologists , Male,5,3.75,2015-02-11T04:04:04.336Z,5,5,5,5,5,I had a bad arrhythmia that Dr. Fellows was able to cure. He saved my life. I am alive and have three grandchildren that I love.
17,Dr. Christopher L. Fellows,Seattle,Washington, Cardiologists , Male,5,3.75,2014-10-09T05:55:03.337Z,5,5,5,5,5,"I first met Dr. Fellows in Yakima three weeks after my second trip to the ER with PSVT. His visit with me was brief, but it didn't need to be lengthy -- the ECG's confirmed that I had had two PSVT's that converted with Adenosine, and I was a candidate for cardiac ablation, which was three weeks later. A year and a half later, I felt the familiar racing of my heart going into PSVT and went to the hospital. The following Monday morning, I called to see if Dr. Fellows still came to Yakima on a specific Tuesday (the next day), and he did. I was seen the next day, and three weeks later had another cardiac ablation. As another reviewer stated, you may have to wait to get in to see him, but your heart could not be in better hands if you're having cardiac electrical issues."
18,Dr. Christopher L. Fellows,Seattle,Washington, Cardiologists , Male,5,3.75,2012-05-15T15:34:20Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Fellows did an ablation procedure for me about 10 years ago. Appointments may be scheduled further out than you might wish but that is because he so sought after. I have found him to be very busy but also a caring, patient centered physician. I will have Dr Fellows perform another ablation in the other atria."
19,Dr. Christopher L. Fellows,Seattle,Washington, Cardiologists , Male,5,3.75,2011-01-11T22:56:58Z,1.5,3,1,1,1,"Spent 5 minutes with me. Gave me no diagnosis, reviewed basic tests done by my GP and didn't order any other tests but suggested surgery. Even my GP and the Emergency doctors said additional tests were needed. He is arrogant and condescending. I suggest you look for someone that cares about people and doesn't see you as a number or surgical statistic."
20,Dr. Sarah Speck,Seattle,Washington, Cardiologists , Female,2,4.75,2009-11-29T19:30:38Z,4.8,5,4,5,5,I saw Dr. Speck after a medication gave me heart palpatations and high blood pressure. I had been diagnosed with a PFO that another cardiologist refused to fix until I had a stroke. (pfo is believed to be a cause of stroke) and she not only ran more tests she refered me to another PFO specialist who agreed with her that I needed my PFO closed. (Dr. Castarella not on this list) and I have now had that operations. Had it not been for Dr. Speck I could very well have had a devestating stroke. She is the best and I highly reccommend her!
21,Dr. Sarah Speck,Seattle,Washington, Cardiologists , Female,2,4.75,2008-04-28T16:47:26Z,4.8,5,4,5,5,I am so glad I found Dr. Speck. She is an excellent Dr. I trust her knowledge so much. I have been her patient since 1992. She got me on the correct meds and my life/health has been wonderful since then. Her nurse is an angel too :)
22,Dr. Margaret L. Hall,Seattle,Washington, Cardiologists , Female,2,4.63,2015-03-17T05:12:44.001Z,4.5,4,5,4,5,I absolutely love Dr. Hall. She has been my cardiologist for nearly 15 years and her care has allowed me to be here for my family. I feel like we have grown old together. I count myself blessed that she was the doctor on call the night I was taken to the ER. 
23,Dr. Margaret L. Hall,Seattle,Washington, Cardiologists , Female,2,4.63,2009-02-11T12:01:46Z,4.8,5,4,5,5,"I have been a patient of Dr. Hall for over 10 years after having a heart attack. She has performed angioplasties; in one, she implanted 3 stints in a partially narrowed artery. She is very knowledgeable, up to date on latest treatments for arteriosclorosis, arrythmia, and general heart health. She generally follows up an exam with recommendations to me and to my family doctor. She has a good sense of humor butcan be a bit feisty if you don't follow her advice and recommendations."
24,Dr. Peter Baciewicz,Seattle,Washington, Cardiologists , Male,2,4.25,2009-06-05T19:30:41Z,4.8,5,4,5,5,"caring cardiologist with outstanding clinical skills and up-to-date knowledge. Coordinated my husband's care after a cardiac arrest six years ago. I watched him organize everything, visit at least once daily, and always have time to explain and answer questions, whether mine or interns or residents. My husband is doing well 6 years later after much care from this outstanding MD."
25,Dr. Peter Baciewicz,Seattle,Washington, Cardiologists , Male,2,4.25,2009-03-04T20:06:23Z,3.8,4,1,5,5,"I moved to town and knew no doctors, and did a little snooping and starting going to Dr. Baciewicz. This was very good fortune. I don't know that I've ever before seen a Doc that is as good natured, approachable, and most importantly- such a capable listener. I would extend this praise to his whole practice. I wish I didn't have to go so often, but have a great deal of comfort and confidence with Dr. Baciewicz and his group. Oh- as for punctuality- they don't seem to be ""like clockwork""- I nearly got my vehicle towed one day that things ran long. I normally get bent by waiting in rooms for doctors, but in this case I'd wait all day- the care is that good."
26,Dr. MARK Reisman,Seattle,Washington, Cardiologists , Male,3,3.67,2013-12-28T10:03:37Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr Reisman is fantastic, he has a great bedside manner. His staff is great now that his nasty nurse is gone. I can't say enough about how wonderful this man is!!"
27,Dr. MARK Reisman,Seattle,Washington, Cardiologists , Male,3,3.67,2012-08-02T17:01:41Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. R. and his staff, including fellows, are amazing. After my heart surgery, I was having a bad day. He called me personally on the phone to check on me and ensure I was okay. He is kind, compassionate, patient, and FUNNY. He has a wicked sense of humor, which I appreciate. Wonderful cardiologist."
28,Dr. MARK Reisman,Seattle,Washington, Cardiologists , Male,3,3.67,2012-06-05T21:42:31Z,1,1,1,1,1,His assistants and staff refuse to assist in any billing conflicts. He insists in ordering unnessesary tests knowing the patents insurance will not cover the expense.
29,Dr. Robert G. Thompson,Seattle,Washington, Cardiologists , Male,3,3.58,2017-12-15T00:40:49.311Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr Thompson was recommended by one of my coworkers. I had just retired from the US Navy , was used to high quality care, and needed a civilian doctor. That was 24 years ago. Dr Thompson quickly gained my trust and respect. I have been to see him every year for a physical and occasionally to aches and pains. He always gives me his whole attention and takes more time than I would expect. The annual physicals are thorough and efficient. His staff is great. I heartily recommend him. "
30,Dr. Robert G. Thompson,Seattle,Washington, Cardiologists , Male,3,3.58,2013-08-12T21:43:47Z,4.5,4,4,5,5,"This man has written an invaluable book which I recommend to many others, so they do not end up with the scourge of the 21st century: diabetes. I cannot thank him enough for writing the book he wrote in 2006, it has helped me and every other person to whom I recommended it. I am a medical professional (MD) myself. Thanks to this book I am able to help so many more patients, and for that I am grateful."
31,Dr. Robert G. Thompson,Seattle,Washington, Cardiologists , Male,3,3.58,2013-03-06T06:41:40Z,1.3,1,2,1,1,"This Doctor has reached the end of his practice at age 68. It has become quantity over quality of service to pad his retirement. This Dr. refuses to listen to patients. Example, gave me unsafe medicine that I shouldn't have taken. A severe reaction occurred causing me to black out. When numerous phone calls were made to him and or the on call doctor, I was promptly ignored. Nor were there any follow up. This and forgetting to write down appointments, then get caught in a lie when you show up. Nor has this doctor properly treated my other medical conditions. I consider this doctor to be unsafe. Also the office manager shills out for his publish books, trying in vain to sell you a copy ""really?"". Do yourself a kindness and avoid this doctor altogether."
32,Dr. Charles Cheng Huei Lin,Seattle,Washington, Cardiologists , Male,1,5,2018-03-09T15:16:10.589Z,5,5,5,5,5,"J'ai rencontré le Dr Lin à l'urgence du CHRDL de Joliette. J'ai fortement apprécié le temps et les explications généreuses, simples, et claires qu'il m a prodigués. Il a fait preuve de beaucoup de générosité dans son temps. A répondu à toutes mes questions en détail. S'est assuré que l'information avait bien été comprise. Avec beaucoup de gentillesse, de patiente et de professionnalisme. J'ai 77 ans et s'est adressé à moi sans aucun agisme. Je l'ai adoré et surtout, il m'a rassuré et m'a donné des outils pour mieux gérer mon problème et savoir quoi faire avec les symptômes . Je le recommande très fortement!"

He answers questions and nothing is off limits he will explain it to you and never talk over your head. He's knowledgeable and up to date on the newest things going on in cardiology. He sits with you the patient and will not rush you, he gives you everything you need. This man has a great sense of humor too! He has a great staff from medical assistant to receptionist."

41,Dr. Karen K. Stout,Seattle,Washington, Cardiologists , Female,1,4.25,2014-08-15T08:11:54.859Z,4.3,4,3,5,5,"She's a really great Cardiologist. She's knows her stuff and has a particular interest in how chemotherapy affects the heart. She also works at Children's. She has a straight forward bedside manner, and is really no bs, which is nice to have in a doctor. She will tell you the truth, and give you treatment options in a straightforward, but but non-callous way. She wants you to understand what's going on with your care and will answer any questions you have. During my first appointment with her, she spent a lot of time answering any questions I had and was really patient with me. During my second appointment, she was also great about answering questions and also very patient and never rushes me.
She listens to your concerns, doesn't belittle you for those concerns, and will work with you to find a solution. Additionally, when I mentioned that I wanted a second opinion, she welcomed that (she said ""I think second opinions are great!"") and reached out to a colleague at the hospital that I wanted to go to. She admits when she doesn't know something, and is happy to say that she can ask someone who has a bit more experience with that particular issue. I've found her to be very responsive and I think that she's a gem of a doctor. She also seems to be really up to date on current research. Her staff is nice, and her scheduler Jillian is also incredibly helpful and on top of things. Her cardio fellow that I met was also very competent, had prepared very thoroughly, and was on top of things. They are pretty on top of things as a clinic. It's UW and sometimes other patients come in late, so I was ok with being delayed a bit. If you don't want to be delayed you can book the first appointment of the day with doctors, as they won't be delayed by any patients before you.
I would say that she's kindhearted and cares, but not in an overly emotional way. She also shows up prepared for the appointment, and has read up on your recent doctors notes before she sees you. She's also been really great in working with my other doctors and has been just really great overall. She's just awesome! And it's a relief to know she will be on top of anything cardio related. I don't worry about anything with her, which is a blessing. She also was a competitive soccer player when she was younger and has a great sense of humor and is friendly."
42,Dr. Jeff S. Gibbs,Seattle,Washington, Cardiologists , Male,2,2.88,2011-06-05T18:40:28Z,3.8,3,4,4,4,"Gibbs himself, is thorough and very helpful. Any questions I have asked regarding my condition he makes sure to answer either with pictures or verbally. He stays on the conversative safe side which is great when dealing with the heart. He is punctual and makes sure to visit with me personally. I have had my doctor at UWMed miss two years of visits so it it nice to have consistency. His nurse staff is great, the sonographer makes you feel a little awkward."

He is a leading electrophysiologist and cardiologist. He is pure genius and has authored and published MANY articles on heart conditions. He has a way of making people feel better about themselves and their conditions, without lying to you or sugar-coating the truth. He is non-judgemental and appreciates all people... regardless of their weight, age, sex, culture, etc... His clinic is always busy and you better keep your appointments though.. it is sometimes tough to be seen when you want, but once you get an appointment.. KEEP IT! His front desk staff is HIGHLY organized and professional, yet they could be a little more empathetic and personable."

It is a routine procedure that should have taken 1 hour. Instead Belz burned a hole through his heart, my husband bled out, had a stroke on the table. Another surgeon stepped in, did emergency open heart surgery and saved his life. Subsequently, my husband had another stroke and ever since has been unable to work. I was left with two small children to raise and my husband has aged significantly since that time. There are many fine surgeons around, and other doctors have told us that this should not have happened. He didn't even have the class to apologize for his mistake or follow up at all."
