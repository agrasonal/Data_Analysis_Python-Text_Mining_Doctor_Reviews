We had been to 6 family doctors in the area with unhappy results until we found Dr Radman. He came highly recommeded to us and we can see why. He never rushes you and has been very helpful with various problems that we have had. I'm amazed at how he knows so much about so many things. My wife and I go about 4 times a year each and he has been helpful each time, including one time when I had a medical problem while outside the country and had to call him. We have never had to wait more than a couple of days for an appointment."

The staff though, is something to improve on. My wife had very unpleasant experience with the staff (rudeness, even lies) so much that she changed the PCP."

I can see the PA as much as I want to however , they tend to be of little help unless the problem is basic, Our family has had several serious medical problems in the past few months and we get as far as the PA and then we are referred to antoher specialist only to be referred back to the PCP for further follow up to get yet more questions from the nurses who seem to have better things to do than speack with patients about care. The nurses have been rude and lack basic knowledge. North Chattahoochee practice has been the source of frustration and concern for our family over the last few months and while we anxiously await our change in PCP. On two occassions with two seperate family members both with abdominal pain, they were not checked for appendicitis until several visits were made and now we are awaiting the second appendectomy. My worst complaint no follow up on the problem"

The office staff is horrible and scheduling is a nightmare. I've had several appointments cancelled on me and it takes forever to get lab work back. When you go for an appointment you have plenty of time (waiting over an hour is typical) to watch people haggle with the front desk for their test results. When I was in high school and dealing with some major hormonal mood swings, the nurse I saw wrote me a prescription for an anti-depressant and sent me on my way. No further evaluation, no referral to someone with actual mental health credentials, just 'Oh you get bad PMS and social anxiety once a month? Here, take a psychotropic drug every day.' What?! I also sat with my dad for over an hour while he writhed in pain from what turned out to be a kidney stone. He ended up going to the bathroom, passing it, and we left before anyone even saw him. I was livid."

He has always been correct in diagnosis and has a great bedside manner. His staff is excellent, know me by name and my history and will answer calls on the phone for help. Only problem I have now is that he is TOO popular, scheduling routine appts is always a ways off. But if I have an urgent issue, he and his staff will always ""squeeze"" me in. I am thankful I found him!"

He also misdiagnosed my migraines. The guy is a great listener with a wonderful bedside manner, but these things don't make him a competent physician. Perhaps he can be trusted with routine care on healthy people, but if you have anything else going on, find another GP."

But... there is always a ""but"", He is very busy and it became very hard to make timely appointment. I want my doc to be available to me on a short notice. In last year i made 6 ""emergency"" appointments, 1 physical and 2 regular follow ups. I saw my doc only twice last year!!! Other times i was seen by other doctors who work in the same office.

He was recommended to my by my sister-in-law and we both love him because he is down to earth and is very patient with all our questions.

He is willing to take time with the patient rather than just rush in and out like some I have had in the past.

I saw Dr. Stahura for about nine months. I did not feel comfortable from the beginning when he didn't even believe me when I answered his questions. When I asked him why he made the decisions he made he got mad at me and told me to leave if I didn't like it, instead of explaining why he made certain decisions. I couldn't believe my own doctor was threatening me. A doctor is supposed to be somebody you can trust. I changed doctors and practices altogether. I will never go to Absolute Care or Dr. Stahura again. Awful experience all around."

Beware, the bill for this was $674.01!!! What?!?! I wasn't even sick. It was roughly $300 for the physical and $374 for blood work that the doctor said was included in the physical. Even when I left the office the report said ""Services to be billed: Preventive Wellness Exam"" and that was it. I questioned the doctor saying that I didn't want blood work if I would have to pay for it. She said it was part of the exam. I did not expect the blood work to be a separate bill, but rather included under the Exam. When I called to ask about it they said that the blood work is billed separately and is done as part of the ""Preventive Wellness Exam"" but is billed separately. I consider this place quite expensive and you may be stuck with services you didn't need. I felt tricked into services I wasn't planning to pay for."

Regarding Helpfulness: Dr. Roberts demeanor during visits was to say the least unacceptable. She had no interest in listening to the patient when treatment methods were offered ( By the patient ) . It was her call or nothing at all.(She had no interest in seeing the patient and sent in her nurse when patient / Dr. relations were compromised .) Regarding Knowledge ; She left her patient wondering if the quality of care toward them was in the interest of patient care . i.e. When the patient told her of a prior treatment that had worked very well for them , She ignored this and substituted what she considered to be the best for the patient , even though she was told that the patient had previously used the medication that was being suggested and was extreemly satisfied with the result ."

I just found this out today as I was gathering medical records to see a doctor at Emory for the same problems that I had originally seen her for. Oh, by the way, in case you are wondering, the drug tests were all negative.

He is very thorough and compassionate. He is excellent when giving out referrals for specialties if he deems follow up is necessary. After yearly physicals, he sends a personal letter/email for follow up. He also uses WebMD to log test results. Your data is always available.

I have been a patient of his for over 9 years and he has ALWAYS provided expert services, expert care, expert advice and is very concerned about the health and well-being of his patients. If he is not a specialist in the area of which you need, would you rather him ATTEMPT to diagnose you or would you rather him send you to someone who specializes in your condition, one who can get you well! It only takes one thing that does not go someone's way for them to slander or bash someone. They seem to forget the overall situation. Dr. Reid is compassionate and he always, always follows up with me after my physicals with recommendations, etc. He is the primary care provider for me and my family and I have referred many people to him who are extremely grateful for the recommendation. He cares about people in general. He even calls on weekends to follow up and see how things are going and makes himself available. He is great!"

The staff in the front is good but if you are american and aren't fluent in Spanish beware of the hispanic girl who answers the phone on occasion. If you have a problem she will have no idea of what you are talking about. And she becomes frustrated with you as if it were your fault. But don't let that deter you. Dr. Reid is a good & caring doctor. And yes, I have been sent to specialist as well. If he recognizes a problem that should be looked at wouldn't you prefer he sent you to someone who specializes in that field of medicine? I would. I don't think he's trying to help colleagues make extra money, no scandal going on here. Just a good doctor trying to help people & get them well. Give the guy a break. But please, keep the Spanish speaking employee for the Spanish speaking patients! what a challenge and the last thing you want to deal with when you don't feel well."

He was extremely helpful and caught masses in my neck that other doctors over looked. In another instance his nurse called several doctors/specialists for me and was able to move my appointment up three weeks with a specialist. It is also easy to be seen.

I've been a patient of his for many years and he has ALWAYS provided prompt, caring and thorough care. I've recommended several friends and associates to his practice and they've had equally good experience. His office has had staff turnover, but what doctor's office hasn't? Yes, sometimes there is a wait, but what doctor's office doesn't have a wait? If more Docs were as good as Dr. Reid, we'd all be much healthier."

In the many years I saw Dr. Scurlock, I always waited before seeing him, was herded to a smaller waiting room, and then waited again in the patient room. David is a really nice man, however, I don't think he makes a great doctor. On the last few visits I felt my problems were ignored or dismissed. I have PCOS, a hormone deficiency that he apparently does not understand. He gave me a pill to treat one of the symptoms but never addressed the underlying problems, which continued to get worse until I was finally diagnosed as pre-Diabetic. I began researching PCOS and saw a specialist on my own. When I saw Dr. Scurlock again, I updated him on what the endocrinologist had done for me. He actually said HE could have done that for me! I had been asking him for this type of help for years. He began treating me like a traitor on this visit, so I never went back. I am much healthier now than when I saw him."

He was filling in at the walk-in clinic several years ago when I went in, and I've been using him ever since. When BCBS and Piedmont were having their dispute, I wrote to BCBS and told them that if they were not able to continue with Piedmont, I'd have to leave them, because I wasn't leaving Dr. Scurlock. I'm shocked that anyone could have a bad experience, but given the nature of the business, it is bound to happen from time to time."

He listens to you, takes the time to explain the possibilities and options for treatment, and makes sure you're okay, with follow up when needed. I first went to Dr. Scurlock when my regular GP couldn't see me that afternoon. I soon switched to make Dr. Scurlock my primary care physician,because in my 48 years of medical treatment - he and his staff are the best I've ever known - always very professional, prompt and considerate, and Dr Sculock has been right on target with his diagnoses, and prescribed courses of treatment. I'm happy to say, I'm doing great, thanks to their care. I've recommended Dr. Scurlock to many friends and family, and all of them have been grateful for the referral. In a way, Dr. Scurlock reminds me of an earlier generation of doctors, who were conscientious and caring in their work. I appreciate having a physician I can trust to be honest, who takes the time to find out what's going on, and makes sure his patients are treated well."

Dr. Scurluck was the first doctor who has ever spent time with me. I went in to his office with a list and he acknowledged every one and offer his opinion. Most doctors come in for 4 minutes, misdiagnose you, write a prescription and send you to the desk for payment. Dr. Scurluck is the best doctor I've ever had."

I was seeing him for headaches for months, which he related to stress. I ended up in the ER with a BP of 200/140, and feeling faint. Another time I hurt my leg in a fall, which he just said was a slight bruise. After a week and a second visit he finally took x-rays. I saw a specialist and ended up in a brace and was told I should not have been walking on the leg at all. He would not listen to me, and seemed arrogant. The final straw was when I informed him I suspected I was bitten by a spider.My thumb was red and swolen, but was told it was not and to soak my thumb in salt water. After a week, I almost ended up in surgery because of a severe infection in my entire hand. On my second visit he prescribed anti-inflamitories. Finally, after 3 weeks I was cured by simple antibiotics prescribed by second doctor. Avoid Dr. Scurlock if you value your health."

I've always been a little put-off by his attitude (let's just say he thinks VERY highly of his opinion and time), but today was the last straw. I suggested that I reschedule my appointment after waiting over an hour to have blood drawn. He told me I was being irrational, had no respect for his ""bad day"", and told me he was about to ""start acting unprofessional"" unless I left. I've never been treated in such a manner by a doctor, and will never go back. I could put up with his gruff and unfriendly demeanor for only so long, but it's time for me to find a new doctor who respects me. If you choose to go to Dr. Scurlock, be sure to have very thick skin. That being said, his nurses are wonderful."

Suffice it to say that I presented w/ a potentially deadly disease (testicular cancer) which is very often misdiagnosed because it's so rare. David was on the ball (literally), the moment I got in; I had an outpatient diagnostic follow-up at a Top100 hospital within 4 hrs (he called for an appt from his cell). All the specialists he recommended are top-notch, also. Heck, I even trust him w/ my wife and children. Nothing more needs to be said!"

The office has always been able to work me in, even last-minute and I've never waited longer than a few minutes. Dr Smith will also quickly give a referral to a local expert when your care is beyond the scope of her practice.

With the amount of pill mills and abuse that is going on, doctors are being watched carefully. I have been seeing Dr. Alexander for over 2 years and I have been getting medication without issue and have never been questioned. I get regular imaging and see my primary care doctor 4 times per year. Dr. A supplements the other doctors and all are aware of each other. Dr. A is NOT a sketchy pill dispenser.

I have cervical pain in my neck with severe migraines and Dr. Alexander did me the same way. He took my money weekly; however, I didn't get relief until he referred me to a neurologist. Even after that, I complained of shoulder pain...he didn't believe me. After 2 mths of complaining and 3 office visits ($$$) He, referred me to an orthopedic surgeon, I had bone spurs and a torn rotator cuff. The OS wrote me RX and scheduled me for surgery! If you're looking for a compassionate MD, E.A is not your guy. If you're looking for a ""natural healing"" MD, maybe you will like him. I DO NOT like taking pain reliever (not even tylenol)but, when in severe pain, one should be provided more options from their MD than berries and vitamins and oils. Went to this MD for over 6 yrs and the treatment only got worse. The office staff is better than years ago but,I wouldn't go back. My opinion: Insurance HOG ALERT. Appt after appt...no relief."

I had records with an MRI report proving my condition and the medication that I had been previously prescribed. He gladly took my money, however, would not accept me as a patient because he did not believe I had any pain from arthritis.

While locations may change Dr. Bush has not, in the important ways, at least. If you are her patient you almost feel like family. Her open-mindedness and compassion for people from all walks of life is inspiring. She strives to heal the whole person, body and soul. Also inspiring is her commitment to serve her community: she volunteers at a hospice and does charity work for mistreated communities around the world.
Staff is usually friendly and knowledgable - love the older nurse who has been with her forever, and Mary is very competent and nice. A young nurse who work(s)/(ed?) with her was dismissive and downright rude. Not Dr. B's m.o.
The only serious complaint is wait time. A 2pm appointment (scheduled days in advance) ended with a THREE HOUR wait before she saw me. I was actually the last patient to leave. Ironically, I was sicker than I'd been in years, with pneumonia. Apparently the young nurse didn't think I was worth being seen, and I vow to never return because of wait time (1 -2 hours is average), but I think you would be hard-pressed to find a more caring and comprehensive doctor in all of Georgia.

She did a great job of curing my bronchitis and I trust both these places because of a situation I had with a prior doctor in another state that I have documentation about lasting over seven years and it was not necessary. I had excruciating pain and could not walk normally, my legs were heavy. They both talked to me about my diet and when I took those five fluid pills, me walking more like myself instead of Frankenstein or Fred Sanford, take your pick, was a miracle because it had taken more than seven years to get back to my normal walk. I love the experience and these guys give you information that helps you, not keeping you coming back to get money out of your pocket or recommend you to a specialist who wants you to do an immediate hip operation, when all you needed was five fluid pills! Come on now, try these guys first!!!! The only thing I can say that might hurt you and I was smart enough to take their advice and just about everybody told me the same thing, whatever you do, when you take those fluid pills, DON'T TAKE THOSE JOKERS AT NIGHT! You will be sooorry! I am glad I didn't get operated on and I learned that you must go out of state sometimes and seek better medical care and I am fortunate to have run across these two doctors! Thank you so much because you all will never know unless maybe you have been where I was that long in pain and agony, to see it all vanish in weeks. "

The appointment was set for 10:20 am. Upon my arrival, which was shortly after 10:00am, I became aware that she was not there. While waiting, two additional patients showed up and signed in. Her employees had horrible attitudes and were extremely unprofessional. After sitting for over 30 minutes, her poorly trained receptionist stood up and said 'Dr. Cathy is not here, can y’all reschedule?' I inquired about her arrival time, she said around 12:30 pm. I told the receptionist that I could not wait that long and she replied 'hold on'. She then announced that Dr. Cathy would be there around 11:30. After that announcement, they checked in the elderly lady that came after me and then checked me in. As I sat in the room, one of her assistant’s came in, took my vitals, and ask if I was really going to wait on the doctor? I told her that I cannot just go back to work for an hour and come back. Dr. Cathy finally showed up and went to see the elderly lady first. I sat in the room, heard her prompt a healthy womanhood to an elderly woman and heard her play a video from her phone. After waiting for 2 hours, I couldn’t wait any longer. Frustrated, I demanded my lab results and left at noon without seeing the doctor. She has not offered an apology for her unpolished behavior and still charged my insurance company. In my book that is stealing! SHE IS THE WORST DOCTOR IN ATLANTA! If you still consider using her, pay attention to her assistant’s attitude, out dated forms, and unprofessional appearance of the facility."

He is in the same building as before but on the second floor. His new office runs MUCH better than Perimeter North did without all of the shuck and jive things that were annoying. The folks at Perimeter North will not tell you where he is now and will try yo get you to see another one of their Doctors. I found his new practice through Google.

At first he suggested xrays but I said I had already had them and nothing showed up. I went for my MRI and was refered by Dr High to a specialist however, the specialist needed new xray in order for my insurrance to cover his services. I called Dr High s office numerous times and spoke to his assistant who never called back. When I got a hold of her she said that Dr High would get around to sending an xray request when he had time because he felt I had refused this service at an earlier time. It took 3 weeks to get it through. By that time I had to resechudle my appointment with the specialist because of the delay and was pushed back another month. I finally got my xrays done and waited for Dr high s call with the results. It has been 2 weeks and I sill havnt heard from him. I have gotten a copy of the report myself from the hospital and now have to wait until next month to see the specialist."

He quipped that most people live to be 85 and inferred I was imagining my symptoms - then after doing an EKG, he told me to walk across the street to the emergency room with the printouts - he didn't call to say I was coming - I was admitted and received $30,000 worth of diagnostic tests only to find out that I had a hyperthyroid condition. After I found out that the condition could cause loss of bone, I called him to ask for a prescription for a bone density test, which he refused to write if I didn't come in for a physical, even though he received all the test results from the hospital and I had been in the office the week before."

I trust him completely if I know whats wrong with me. If I wake up feeling lousy, I love the fact that I can call him at 8, have an appointment at 9, and be at the pharmacy by 9:30. But I also take a daily prescription medication. I've been on this for years, Dr. Yager would give a 30 day supply and every month I would see him (and his new staff). My new GP is happy to make life much easier with a 90 day supply and 3 refills."

At first I was very impressed by his caring manner and that I could get an appointment the same day. To be able to see your doctor within an hour of calling is unheard of in Atlanta, so this is a huge plus if you just need an antibiotic perscription. But I have noticed over the years the increasing restrictions on doctors have negatively impacted his practice. He doesn't seem to go the extra mile anymore and the fact that he charges a surcharge for credit card payments is a violation of the MC/VISA merchant agreement. He also is not very familiar with the top specialists in the area so his referal ability is severely hampered. He also has trouble hiring proficient staff and has to do a lot of the paperwork himself. Bottom line, for an emergency he is vastly superior to the hospital emergency room, but if you have a serious or chronic condition, he is not an ideal choice."

I have been going to him since 1997. The personalizaed care is unheard of these days. He calls you at home to see how you are doing and if the medicine is working!!! Can you believe that! You can get an appointment on the same day if necessary. I recommend him highly. He takes care of my whole family.

Visition dr gave me a new diagnosis of diabetes type 2. Schedule apt. to see Dr. Yager the following week. Got a call the next day to tell me it was type 1 diabetes. Went in for my schedule appointment. All he did was have a nurse do a finger prick test to tell me my sugar was high(already know that!) and charged me another $20 and told me to go see a specialist in my healthcare network!

her concerning your personal health care. She resents that you would even try! She will absolutely lash you with her tongue and you will never see it coming! She missed the semester on patient relations in Med school. Also, I'm gonna go ahead and expose her on the plethora of specialist
she will send you to and the unnecessary tests she will require. Dare you question the med queen on these items as she will attack hard. I'm convinced she remains in the practice against all the bad reviews as she is probably the top money maker for the practice. They get huge kickbacks from every Specialist she refers you to! This review is far too dangerous so I doubt it will ever post but let me assure you, you DO NOT want her as your physician!!!!

Have phone call in to request clarification. No call back yet - 14 hours. I don't feel like Dr. Tobin is including me in my own healthcare - sounds strange I know.

I was able to get an appointment by that afternoon and was surprised at the short wait time. Dr. Tobin was very helpful and spent time explaining what I would need to do to regain full functioning and referred me to a joint and nerve specialist to make sure that there was no permanent damage to my hand.

The ER found no signs of a stoke. I went to a neurologist and all the test the neurologist did, found no signs of a stoke, or anything. My eyes were bothering me, so I got them checked. All was fine. So far, something was wrong with me, but all my tests were fine. I scheduled an appointment with Dr. Adams to see if he had any ideas on my health issue, or if he could refer me to someone who could help. His nurse was very concerned with my needs. Then Dr. Adams came in. He was rude, angry and very disrespectful to me. I told him everything that was going on with me, but he said to me ""why are you seeing me? You are seeing a neurologist, I'm an internist. You expect me to override a neurologist.?"" Why would any doctor say this? I don't want you to ""override"" a neurologist, but maybe have some concern over my health condition and possibly refer me to someone who can help. He wanted to leave the room as soon as he came in, and he acted like I was wasting his time. Dr. Adams, if you don't like your job, maybe you should seek a new line of work. This is the worst, most disrespectful doctor I have ever seen. Do your self a favor and avoid this doctor at all costs.

There was one point where I had to see her every week due to issues. This was not her doing, it was me showing up unexpectedly needing to be seen! She was always able to take me in within a few minutes. Although we had no idea what was going on with me at that time, her original diagnosis was correct, but I was not a ""normal"" case of this particular condition so she couldn't jump right to diagnosis that was actually correct. She was very caring and compassionate on every one of my visits. Although I hate that tiny, overcrowded and over priced parking deck at Piedmont Hospital, She knows my history and me without really having to look at my chart. That. is very comforting. Her new office is amazing, the front desk clerks are friendly, the lab tech needs a replacement. She drew blood for the WRONG test and said I need to come back to re-test. I did not return to retest since I'm an hour away. Ill be back though."

She seemed OK, but did write alot, did not offer up much info, I was worried about my weight gain since menopause, since she is on the heavy side, she told me to control my portions. They drew blood and did a bone density test - I got a so very unprofessional letter with very few results listed - cholesterol high and she needs to see me, and I have the beginnings of osteoporosis (SP?) she didn't give a damn about that - she sent me e-mails to chat with her at relay health, where all my results are posted, and where I could never get to, I went for a follow up visit to discuss the results of my physical, and the staff tried to charge me my co-pay, I walked out, BC/BS does not let a doctor charge for a follow up - she has not followed up with me except for an invitation to have all my records on line at Relay Health.

I waited nearly 50 minutes after they had me remove my clothes for her to administer my pap. I also called once on a Friday afternoon to have my test results faxed somewhere and got a horribly rude person who seemed mad I called because she was an ""answering service"" and acted like I was a moron to assume that a doctor's office would be open at 3:00pm on a weekday - Dr. Evan's office is apparently closed, however I didn't need the attitude. It also took me 4 times of actually speaking to nurses before they actually fulfilled my fax request. On top of the poor experiences, I also did not like having to fight the ""big hospital"" traffic and parking situations. I have been to Dr. Evan's twice now and will not be returning."

Based diagnosis on objective data and discounted subjective information. The objective data could have lead to several various diagnosis and the final diagnosis would have benefitted from his taking into account the patients subjective report. It is my opinion that this lead to a mis-diagnosis. In layman's terms--he doesn't believe the patient. This is common in medicine and unfortunate. Doctor believes they are the 'expert' and patients are just an annoying detail. This doctor also called in the same very expensive prescription for me that he had just given me a couple days earlier and that I told him was not working. I did not realize until I had paid for it and got it home. He then told me that this was the only medicine that the FDA or DEA would allow which was not true. Specifically he called in Tussionex and I told him it was too strong for me and asked for something else. Would not return

HIs staff was nice but did not bother to tell me my Ins. was not covering my care until I got a HUGE bill in the mail several months later. The DR. was nice at first but did not listen well. My final straw with him was when, for some reason, he finished my last appointment in the waiting room in front of other patients. I got the feeling that he wanted me to go away. I had three broken bones and he acted like I was drug seeking or something because I was in pain. I got the feeling he thought I was ""below"" him. Many people love him though. He is easy to get in to see and may be good if you need shots to leave the country or something but he NEVER ran any test for me to find out what I may have. I have a feeling he mis-diagnosed me. I had a cough and he gave me a strong cough medicine, when it did not work he called in the SAME thing. What worked was an inhaler. I am not going to return."

I didn't do much research, just ended up with Dr Sergile because of location and insurance. We'll now I've been her patient for almost 10 years! She spent 2 years in Europe (returning every 6 months to see patients and keep up her license), and now has moved to the Alpharetta location. I followed her because I believe she's the best! Knowledgeable, kind and caring, she gives you the information that you need to stay in good health, the push to get healthier, and the ability to be part of your care team & take responsibility for your health. I never have a problem getting an appointment when I need it."

I have a history of strep throat and when I came in with signs for strep throat (for the 5th time that year) she tried to convince me that I had acid reflux. At the end of the appointment she looked at the strep test and saw that I did indeed have strep. She has provided my incorrect information in the past and does a poor job of discussing solutions for health issues. She has misinterpreted test results, discouraged me from having medical procedures that other doctors in the practice and outside specialists encouraged (results were positive and solved a major medical issue)."

Unfortunately, I had a scheduled appointment and was given the wrong address for the office (Marietta instead of Atlanta). I called the office to find out the location and let them know I would be late. I arrived at the office 35 minutes after my scheduled appointment and was told by the receptionist that Dr. Sergile refused to see me because I was late. I then asked to speak with the Office Manager who too refused to speak with me in person. I was told I could make another appointment. Yes, I was late but it certainly did not warrant the unprofessional conduct exhibited by the doctor and her staff. This doctor's inflexibility, lack of concern and blatant disregard for people likely manifests itself in her patient care. It is no wonder why the ratings she and her staff have received from patients are so poor. I would NEVER entrust my health to this type of individual! It's in my best interest to go elsewhere!"

She listens and after going to her for several years, she knows that I understand and manage my health issues and supports me in that. But even while we were in the process of building that doctor-patient trust, II always felt she listened. Moreover, she is good at looking at history and seeing patterns and doing what's needed to help me avoid preventable issues."

You can't call & talk to anyone;you have to leave a msg & wait for a nurse to call you back, (never same day). After worrying about symptoms I was having, she ran some tests while I was trying to check on my family history of certain illnesses. Her nurse, Kim, called to give me my results but didnt explain at ALL and seemed irritated at my questions, just saying ""Dr. Sergile says you are fine."" Sorry but, if I am ""fine"" then why do I have these symptoms? Then, I told her that I did, in fact find the illness in question in my family, and that I wanted her to let the Dr know this. No response. I called, left a msg, and got no returned call. After waiting 2 weeks, I requested my lab results, so that I could take them to another doctor to explain. Now, THIS is the best part. Her nurse, called me back, literally, over TWO MONTHS LATER and left a msg for me saying that Dr. Sergile doesn't recommend any further testing. Really? Wow. Completely unacceptable in my opinion."

She recently made a recommendation that I seek impatient treatment for mild depression. Based on my positive experiences with her in the past I trusted her and followed pursuit. This was the worst decision I made in my life. The facility I went to was something out of the 70s. After expressing my concerns with my wife, my wife reached out to Dr Sergile for some guidance, In short she told my wife to get deal with it. It took me three days to get released from this facility. Common sense would be for your doctor to follow up to see how things are going once you patient is released, especially if your wife reached out to you scared and concerned of the environment I was in. Not only have I not received any sort of follow up from Dr Sergile, her assistant and office manager have prevented me from setting up any appointments to see Dr Sergile."

I've been seeing her for about 8 months and am beyond disappointed. She's condescending and sometimes downright rude. When I was very ill and needed a specialist asap I asked her to call them to see if I could get in sooner and she snapped at me and said I have to wait my turn. Needless to say, I was hospitalized 3 weeks later because I wasn't able to get treatment. I recently visited her (for the last time) and she spent the entire time typing the results from my visits to five different specialists and never once looked at me and hustled me out the door. I need a primary care doctor to help put all the pieces together when you arent feeling well. She could care less. I've had a few bad doctors in the past, but she takes the cake. Incorrect and/or delayed test results, poor response time (if at all) and a bad attitude."

She had me do the bloodwork for PT/INR to test the efficacy of my dosage. Well, the test came back extremely low (1 rather than 3), which meant the drug was not working at all at that dosage. (Note that this drug was to minimize the risk of stroke or death.) The funny thing is it took 30 days, that's thirty days, to give me a call and let me know. I guess I lucked out, my cardiologist appointment was a week later so I didn't bother going back. And I'm still breathing, which my kids think is great, but that little detail is obviously far beyond this quack's concern. "

The worst part is the wait time. The front desk is terrible and each time have waited 5-10 minutes before looking at the sign in sheet, even when I was the only one in the waiting room. They are at least 10 minutes late every time, including when I was the first appointment after lunch. This is unacceptable to me. They seem unorganized and are not good at getting back to you with lab or test results. I will most likely find another practice due to these factors, not necessarily because Dr. Gokki is a poor physician. "

In part, some of the previous comments I experienced to be true, such as little personality, but some on my second visit including the staff. The staff have always been courteous. On my first visit she appeared to be in a hurry, but not the second. But after speaking with her, we realized that the appointments have to be scheduled for the appropriate needs per visits. The first was for a refill on previous medication, the second was specific to my medical need and some forms to be filled out. And on the second visit she was thorough and answered all my questions. The medicine she prescribed and demanded for me to take which the insurance company didn't initially want to pay for has made me feel better than I've have in the last 6 months! No joke! That's for real. "

She is inpatient and barely listens to the complaints. She orders unnecessary tests and then leaves the patient with a phone number to call in 7-10 days. Response time for a phone message is not the usual 24 hours, I waited 3 days before I had anyone call me from her office. Office is dingy, drab and dirty. I had an abnormal lab value from a lab drawn in November 2014; her office called me in January to inform me and that I needed to take another drug and to see her in 3 weeks. She never calls the patient herself nor want to visit about health issues. She referred me to specialists after the 3 visits I have been there costing me more money in medical bills. There is no personallity in any of the staff in this office and you could be the only one in the waiting room for 10 minutes before the registration desk acknowledges you. Poor service and very unhappy about my first experience here in Atlanta, are all physicians like this?"

I had read bad reviews of her service before I went to see her but gave her the benefit of the doubt. The bad reviews are every bit true. She seemed to be in a great hurry. She asked questions about my wife's medical history, and cut her off multiple times, all the while typing into the her laptop. After giving her anything but a full medical history, she pushed us out the door. We had other questions, had not even brought up other health complaints. Her manner is brusque, arrogant and condescending. If you have real health issues, this woman is the last person you want to be in a room with. Her bedside manner is nonexistent. I left feeling angry and duped."

Despite the fact that my vision was still blurry, I was not given an appointment until a week from my call. My appointment time was 3:45. At 3:45 I was two blocks from Laureate Medical's office, and stuck in terrible traffic so I called Friedman's office to tell them I would be five minutes to ten minutes late. They told me that I would have to reschedule. Angered I drove up to their office and was in front of their receptionist at 3:54, nine minutes late, and was still told that the doctor would talk to me but I would have to reschedule my appointment. I waited a week, showed the courtesy of calling and then over 9 minutes, was basically shown the door. I have never seen Mark Friedman within 9 minutes of a scheduled appointment."

However, his office staff, particularly Antrice, is so terrible I can no longer be his patient anymore, after 6 years of dealing with her. If you have any billing issues, she will blame you. I work in healthcare & where I work we like to help our patients figure things out because it can be difficult navigating between the billing, insurance and MD worlds. His office, on the other hand, talks down & is condescending to you, as if you should know everything about insurance companies, co-pays, and pre-authorizations. They do not work well if you get a referral to another provider for ie ultrasound, CT scan, etc. They won't send the necessary paperwork in time & you will have to track the office staff down to do it, most likely leaving you to schedule multiple appointments with this referral because pre-appointment paperwork didn't get completed timely. Next, if you ever need the office to send information to your employer, ie annual physical for health insurance information. You can guarantee they will forget to fax it. Again, after you waste your time following up, they will say they did fax it and blame you. Then, eventually you will have to get them to mail it to you so you can do it yourself. Last, if you need medical information about yourself (ie immunizations or labs), be sure that the office staff will probe you as to why you need that...like it's any of their business. Something that they can easily email you from your health file is a problem, as the computer most likely crashed that week & they are having major issues in the office that you can't possibly understand. You will certainly have to pick it up yourself or get it snail mail, even though you've signed consent to receive health records via email. Also, it will be at least a week until it will be ready. I even referred a friend to the office a few years ago. When he arrived for his appointment, they had cancelled it. They called a different patient to confirm and when this patient knew nothing of an appointment, appointment cancelled. So, you would think as this was the office mistake they would be accommodating...think again! He had to re-scheduled & come a different day. If this sounds like something you want to deal with, go for it! I don't need this added bs in my life anymore. Medical office personnel shouldn't be condescending and make you feel frustrated after every conversation."

The waiting room was empty and I did not see another patient the whole time I was there, yet my appointment didn't start until 30 minutes after it was scheduled. Her bedside manner is horrible- almost like she is being inconvenienced by you being there. They post lab results on an online portal. They told me to come back for some additional tests, but I will be going elsewhere based on this horrible experience. I WOULD NOT recommend"
337,Dr. Mary S. Shirey,Atlanta,Georgia, Family Doctors / G.P.s , Female,4,3.13,2014-07-31T13:09:51Z,4.5,5,5,4,4,"Dr. Shirey was my primary care physician for 2yrs while I lived in Atlanta. Her office is cozy, almost like home. Her staff is amazing, Dr. Shirey has even squeezed me in when I was late because I travel by bus due to a stroke that I had and I don't drive. I have always had confidence that Dr.Shirey took my concerns seriously and put forth the best care plan to assure that my health was maintained at a premium level. I was never turned down for care no matter what my condition was. I have never had a cross thought about Dr.Shirey, if I ever moved back to Atlanta she would be my top choice and I'd return to her care in a heartbeat without a second thought! I could continue to shower you with her praises but I won't, just know that I highly recommend her and I have nothing but gratitude for all of her professionalism!"
338,Dr. Mary S. Shirey,Atlanta,Georgia, Family Doctors / G.P.s , Female,4,3.13,2013-09-30T10:36:28Z,2.3,1,2,2,4,"Every time I've visited this office, the staff have been inhospitable. I feel a ""hello"" and ""how are you?"" go a long way, but instead, the administrative staff won't even bother to look up at you. They'll eventually bark orders at you and then herd you around. It's very demoralizing. When I confronted them about a mistake they made (they never sent the lab my insurance information, and I consequently paid a very expensive bill), they never apologized and acted like it was my fault. Diagnostically speaking, my husband went to see Dr. Shirey for a lump on his neck he was very nervous about. Shirey didn't know what it was, a referred him to an Ear, Nose & Throat Specialist, who similarly didn't know anything but suggested a $2,000 CT Scan. Skeptical, we decided to visit a Dermatologist, who, within minutes knew it was a harmless cyst and would go away shortly. I can't imagine if we would have paid for the CT scan! All in all, not happy!"
339,Dr. Charles Taylor,Atlanta,Georgia, Family Doctors / G.P.s , Male,5,2.95,2014-09-25T18:07:05.284Z,1.8,1,2,1,3,I hate this practice and will be leaving it. Dr. Taylor was my husband's physician - by the way he did not catch what turned out to be a terminal illness in my husband - and I started going to him after my physician retired. I can't stand dealing with anyone in the practice. They are rude and it is impossible to get an appoinment for a physical for less than 8 months out. I can't wait to go to someone else. This is the worst practice I have ever been to. Dr. Taylor is rushed and generally seems very aloof.
340,Dr. Charles Taylor,Atlanta,Georgia, Family Doctors / G.P.s , Male,5,2.95,2014-09-11T22:39:52.139Z,5,5,5,5,5,"I feel the exact opposite of some of these reviews. I've been going to Dr Taylor for many years. He is our family Dr and we have always been satisfied. He is rock solid and very smart. Lately he has patiently worked and worked with me to tweak my thyroid meds. He really does care. His assistant is professional, efficient, kind and she can draw blood on the first stick even on kids. She always calls me back and answers all my questions (learn her extension call after hours and leave a vm--she will call you back the next day)."

Getting someone on the phone to answer questions is like pulling teeth. 2. It takes 3 or 4 days for a medical assistant to call you back. 3. Dr. Taylor has no intrest in listening to my needs as a patient. I feel rushed the entire time I'm there. He barely makes eye contact. His overall bedside manor is very cold.

She is hands down the most unprofessional physician I have ever encountered. She was openly rude to me. Waste of money, waste of time. At least it's not just me!! In 2009 I needed a referral for a breast cancer test, she rolled her eyes at me ,said I didn't have an issue when I was in for a check up in the Spring and I didn't have one now. I couldn't leave without the referral so she finally gave me one. ...my referral doc found stage 3 breast cancer. 26 rounds of chemo, 33 radiation treatments, 6 surgeries later and I'm not dead trying to raise two boys. No thanks to her."

She told me I can reduce my cholesterol by eating oatmeal instead of taking statins. That was the best advice I ever got from a doctor. After following for 2 months with this simple diet change Dr. Wadsworth recommended, I came for a checkup and my cholesterol was normal. I cannot tell you how grateful I was for her great advice! My diet before that was wild ocean salmon and organic vegetables and fruits, so who knew that adding oatmeal would help. She is the best so far, all the rest of other doctors tell you what industry tells them to tell you and not what is best for your health. It is very difficult to do the right thing, though, especially when everybody is being brainwashed by the medical industry to do things different way, so I really appreciate her honest answers."
347,Dr. Dana M. Wadsworth,Atlanta,Georgia, Family Doctors / G.P.s , Female,17,2.57,2010-02-15T08:13:02Z,1,1,1,1,1,"Extremely rude. Finally got away from her, but the bad news is I switched to John Read - who was just as nasty and mean. How can the Dek Med group have both Wadsworth/Read? What are they thinking? Neither of these doctors should be allowed near people, much less sick people with needs! They need cubicle jobs somewhere. When I switched to Read, she called me AT MY HOUSE to intimidate me!!! At her place, waits were extremely loooong (take a 1/2 day off, at least) - only to get berated each time. If I didn't go in with a diagnosis of myself to hand her, she would belittle me for not knowing what was wrong with me (How could I? I'm not a dr - that's why I was going in!!). Mean, mean, mean. Check your feelings at the door, and if you leave, get caller ID on your phone so you'll know when she's calling you."

I was not shocked at all to come here and find such a plethora of bad reviews, all stating my exact thoughts. I love the Dekalb Medical community, and I wish she were not a part of it. I agree with the others that her personality is extremely negative and abrasive. I picked her by location only -- she is located in the Highlands. I followed many patients over to Dr. Read's on Briarcliff. When I did, I noticed a worker from her office there, who had also ""fled."" Dr. Wadsworth called me AT MY HOUSE, and demanded to know why I was leaving. It was frightening."

I believe that ""human touch"" is a very important aspect of a healthcare professional's skill set. Unfortunately, she is sorely lacking in this department."

She should have her lisence taken for unprofessional appearance, lack of compassion. I ""HAD"" to go to her due to an insurance change. I was on anti-depressants/antiaxiety meds at teh time. As I was VERY stressed just to be there, I did not need to leave feeling like I was a common drug pusher. She could have easily contacted my ""regular"" doc, but she was ""too busy"". Toss off the unproffessional ""jewelry"", hon! Comb your hair, and don't act like patients aren't your business. I truly hope that Dekalk Medical has replaced this person, and I surely CANNOT call her a ""doctor""....I think that title should be reserved for a person worthy of it!"

If you make an appointment, plan on making it an all day event. You, a couple other patients, and about 1500 pharm. sales reps will be crammed into the waiting room for a long time. I was diagnosed with rosacea and he said you haveit, here's a script. I was not given any care intructions or told how to use the script.

He can take some getting used to though since he is used to patients not knowing much. When a patient comes in with knowledge, he doesn't believe them. First few visits with him were horrible until we got to know each other and now he realises he has to trust me like I have to trust him and since then, it's been wonderful. He has some great people on his staff who will do the best they can do for you. Be prepared for a very, very long visit though. He is also very LGBT friendly (and that specifically includes the trans community.) When it comes to knowledge about the LGBT community's health issues, he is the most knowledgeable doctor in the southeast bar none. He also is very active in the deaf community."

I showed up yesterday and they told me I wasn't on the calender. After the receptionist looked into it she realized they put me on the calender for January 2014. They told me that I had to come back because I wasn't on the calender - The next available appointment was in April....No Thanks. Not happy at all.

Although I thought the front desk staff was friendly, I had a difference of opinions with the doctor and his nurse or medical assistant. First off, the doctor was always in a hurry, would not put down his computer when I was talking, and would rush out of the exam room. After having first hand knowledge of my condition, I could tell that he was not well versed in my diagnosis. His nurse or medical assistant was nice and patient at the beginning but became uncaring and short and developed ""The Attitude"" when I told her that my insurance was going to be cancelled. So overall, no I would not recommend this doctor or medical assistant. Their either too busy to listen and are in it just for the money. Find someone else."

I had a bad cut on my arm that he took care of with obvious expertise. It has been several weeks now, and I'm confident the scar will soon be nearly invisible. I am in my 70's, and I appreciate the fact that he stresses the importance of flu shots , pneumonia and other immunizations. He is in an area where his patients come from many different backgrounds. He speaks Farsi, but he has several ladies on staff who speak fluent Spanish. The day I was there most recently, a woman came in who had been seriously cut by machinery on her left hand. I was leaving, but I could see that she was in very bad shape. I called the next day and was happy to hear that Dr. Abdi repaired her hand and fingers and he stayed 2 1/2 hours to do so!"

I do not recommended Dr.Abdi as a physician. He does not listen to his patients, very rushed and has an under tone of rudeness. I tried to tell him what medications work for me but he would not stop talking over me and prescribed what he wanted . I would trust his judgement on new medications if I felt he really listened to me and my concerns. I do not trust this man and feel like he is behind the times and is not knowledgeable
His lack of bed side manner left me speechless.
At one point of our very rushed visit .. I coughed and covered my mouth .I was facing him (my throat was dry so I was coughing a little more )
The ""doctor"" told me to turn my head that he didn't want my germs
VERY VERY RUDE
He had me so annoyed that I forgot to ask for allgery medicine
I dont want to take anything he prescribed to me
I will be finding a new primary care physician
Complete waste of my time and money
THIS MAN HAS NO BUSINESS PRACTICING MEDICINE
horrible
Oh and he even said negative things about another patient to me how she got on his nerves"

Prescribed me a medicine that did nothing, then had to go to ER next day. Turns out I had the flu, and he gave me medicine for a UTI. Did no tests, didn't even take temperature. Dr. Abdi was condescending because we have AHA ""ObamaCare"", though that's all we can afford."

He intentionally keeps this information from his customers. I went for an appointment at 9:00am and was not seen until 11:00 am. The nurses in the office felt bad for me and confessed that he always does this and that they were instructed to not divulge this information to any of the customers. I'll be seeking out a new family practitioner.

TV's blaring in the none too clean waiting room. The nurses were good, the office staff was uncaring at best. At least, the parking is free, but that is my most positive impression of my several visits to this doctor. I'm so thankful for my current Primary Care Provider!"

She hops to conclusion not based on real science or further analysis. She tries to appear helpful and knowledgeable, but after talking to her, you soon realize her incompetence. Please double and triple check anything she says. She will tell you other doctors are wrong. She takes lots of notes during visits but sill gets confused when you visit her for followups."

I was not thrilled by her cold approach. Asked few questions, looked at her watch all the time. This was discomforting. She checked me rather quickly, did a rapid evaluation, told me I probably had sinusitis, gave me an antibiotic and stood up as if to invite me to leave. I said ""Thanks"" and I left. Time to find another GP."

I am not satisfied with our meeting. I could not get my point across because Dr. Fortin does not seem to listen very well. There is a language barrier since she speaks French and her English is very poor. She was extremely expedient and gave me a prescription without saying much. I will see someone else in the future. Do the same.

I had the impression Dr Fortin was worried about something else instead of me, the patient. The exam was very over quickly and few questions were asked. The communication was just not there. Also, Dr.Fortin seems nonchalant and fairly careless, which is not very reassuring when you are sick. If you can, you should consult someone else. Her English is not very good. Poor interaction."

I made the appointment for him to receive a whooping cough vaccination per his schools request. The request letter from the school was sent with him to the Doctors office with the necessary vaccination highlighted. The Dr. gave him 3 additional vaccines without parental consent. When I asked the Doctor how he could possibly administer a non-emergency medical procedure with out the parents awareness or authorization he defensively postured and told me 'We make the decisions, we decide'."

I was told that if I still experienced the problem after 48 hours to call back. I called my results were not in. Fast forward to a week later. My result FINALLY came back! I was told that my the dr.did not have time to look at my results. Of course,it's now a week later and I'm still waiting on my results...So I called my PRIMARY Care Dr. to see if they could get the results..I was told that they could mail them to me or fax them to another dr. I am confused what's the purpose of your primary care doctor? Shouldn't my primary care dr make sure I was aware of the test results? Shouldn't my primary care dr be just that my primary care dr.SMH it's so hard to find good dr."

I brought my daughter in for a cough that she has had for weeks and he raised his voice to her and told her to stop coughing! He also yelled at me for giving her a medication that was previously prescribed to her by another doctor to try and help her cough. He said that I should of done more research on the medication before I gave it to my daughter! It was prednisone. This Dr was completely out of line and scared my daughter!!!!!!!

When we arrived the next day - they denied him medical care. The Russian nurses can't speak a WORD of English. They are very incompetent and we're unhelpful. They were also very rude to us when we were simply asking them for information on how to correct the problem. When we called the insurance company IN THEIR OFFICE they accused us of lying to them about having insurance and refused to take the confirmation number that the insurance company gave to them. The office is dirty and unkept. I wouldn't recommend this doctor to anyone.

I was told that I had to pay the $65.00 fee in order to get a refill on my prescriptions. He also commented on how many patients come in his office without valid insurance. He said he has to take special precautions to protect himself. No one asked for my medical history. The service and office visit was awful. I would rather go to GRADY!

I had a slight problem with my insurance that was easily solved calling the insurance company, but the office personnel at the clinic was not interested at all in helping me, they were rude and just told me that I would have to pay the full amount. They were not even willing to call the insurance, so I had to call them from my cellphone. After seeing the doctor I had to come back a few days later to request for a certificate explaining my health condition, and they were requesting me to pay another visit to the doctor to give me such certificate. When I complained about paying again, the doctor came out yelling at me and telling me to go if I didn't want to talk to him. I was shocked, I never saw such a behavior in a clinic and from a doctor. My previous experience is that doctors and their staff are always polite, they might probably be arrogant or plain, but never saw a doctor yelling at a patient for such a silly issue."

I asked Dr. Laura Brachman to please order my labs and she told me that she only checks people with my disease process every 12 months. I know my body and when a condition has changed or not. She refused to listen to me. So, I wasted my hope to get positive blood results and I wasted my time and money. I don't encourage anyone to go to Emory Healthcare for help.

They refuse to prescribe birth control for more than 3 months. They messed up trying to draw my blood. They made me come back in for a follow-up a week later after a routine physical and pap smear to tell me everything was fine, but also to take my vitals again. Pretty sure they are taking insurance companies for a ride. Also, there was not a doctor even in the office during my follow-up visit, which took an hour."

Not as bright as her supposed degrees intimate. What country trains ""doctors"" to do this, anyway?"
440,Dr. Sucheta Panchal,Atlanta,Georgia, Family Doctors / G.P.s , Female,1,1,2011-04-14T09:13:27Z,1,1,1,1,1,Went to doctor two weeks ago to get an abdominal lump checked. She recommended I see a dermitologist. She seemed lost and did not understand english very well. If you value your health do not go to this doctor. I had to make another appointment at another practice.
441,Dr. Courtney Shelton,Atlanta,Georgia, Family Doctors / G.P.s , Male,1,1,2015-07-08T20:16:38.881Z,1,1,1,1,1,"I called on a Monday to schedule an appointment for later in the week. I was told the doctor was not available except on Wednesday so I scheduled the appointment. I was told to come early. When I arrived, I could not locate the office and attempted to call for the suite number. I got no answer for the first few calls I made and when I finally got through, they told me they did not have me on schedule. Confused, I thought I might have dialed the wrong number. I checked again and realized I called the right location so I called back to verify I was not on schedule. They told me I was not and that they did not know until Wednesday that the doctor would not be in. I asked why I did not receive a call and they said it was because I was not on the schedule. They were very unhelpful and very unprofessional. I would not even attempt to visit again."

443,Dr. Jillion T. Harris,Atlanta,Georgia, Family Doctors / G.P.s , Female,1,1,2015-11-25T19:11:53.364Z,1,1,1,1,1,"I had an appointment set up with this doctor for a week for a critical issue.
The day of the appointment, 1 hour and 15 minutes before my appointment time (call received at 1:45pm) I received a call from Kiki saying that they were cancelling my appointment because they were closing early for the holidays. I informed her that my appointment was critical, that they set up the appointment, and that another doctor had said it was critical i see them today, and Kiki's response after checking with someone,was i'm sorry, we can only see you Monday (5 days later).
I cannot stress how much I do NOT suggest this doctor. Even when I told them that another physician had said it was critical I get in that day, I was told sorry we want to leave early you have to wait 5 days.
This doctor's office should have know they were closing early, and if they would have let me know earlier, i could have switched physicians... but due to their inability to run an office and their apparent lack of compassion for patients I've been left out in the cold (no pun intended)
Please consider experience here when considering Jillion to be your doctor. Me and my family will definitely be switching PCPs."
