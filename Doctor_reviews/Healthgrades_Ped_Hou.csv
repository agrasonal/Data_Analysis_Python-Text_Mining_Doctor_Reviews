80	May 08, 2017	5	Rheumatology	Dr. Zohair Abbas	Houston,	35	5	My husband visited Dr. Abbas for Lupus. Within days. a week of seeing him-- my husband's condition had improved from zero to 60! We had left the previous Doctor because he was trying to only determine what was causing my husband's flare ups, rather than treating the actual problem. Dr. Abbas is a great listener, explains it easily  and above all a medical professional you can trust. With a help of a dermatologist and Dr. Abbas, we got my husband's flare up under control.  	5	Under 10 minutes	TX	5	4.9	5

On my  wife's  follow-up visit he referred to his notes to carefully assess the effectiveness of the treatment he prescribed.  I found it especially satisfying how he read her face, body language and her ability to grip in order to record accurate scores to the best of his ability.

If we have any emergency questions, or  any urgent case to meet the doctor, the office staff is not allowed to meet the doctor.   They will take the message from us, but not respond.  Because of this office staff dealings I am unsatisfying to go to this Doctors office. Her staff is unorganized and non-efficient. 	3	31 – 45 minutes	TX	1	3.3	3
