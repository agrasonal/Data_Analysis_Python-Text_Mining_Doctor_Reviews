He is an amazing neurologist, provides very good care for his patients, listens, and responds over and beyond what is expected. We will never go to any other neurologist.

He replies to my email even when we are not his patient. The chief neurologist in UCLA is his student. He cares his patient, listen to every concern of mine. And tells his staff to take actions immediately. We will never see any other pediatric neurologist. He is ""THE"" doctor to see for seizures."
4,Dr. Harry T. Chugani,Detroit,Michigan, Pediatricians , Male,7,4.93,2009-03-07T17:38:19Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Chugani is an expert in the field of pediatric neurology, especially infantile spasms. He responds promptly to emails even when he hasn't met the patient yet. In his office he is thorough, kind, and very helpful. I highly recommend this doctor for any child with a seizure disorder. We traveled 300 miles to see him and will do it again if necessary."

7,Dr. Marcus E. Degraw,Detroit,Michigan, Pediatricians , Male,6,4.58,2013-08-23T11:18:47Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Super happy I found this office. Getting harder and harder to find a place that accepts Medicaid, and when I do, I always feel like they treat me like dirt. Not this office! My daughter loves Dr. D and he always stays until I get all my questions answered. The office staff is nice and I never wait to long at all."
8,Dr. Marcus E. Degraw,Detroit,Michigan, Pediatricians , Male,6,4.58,2013-05-08T10:17:39Z,5,5,5,5,5,My kids love Dr. D. They bring him up all the time and even ask to go see him when they get sick.
9,Dr. Marcus E. Degraw,Detroit,Michigan, Pediatricians , Male,6,4.58,2012-11-12T14:45:21Z,2.5,4,4,1,1,"I liked the office and the staff; did NOT like Dr. DeGraw AT ALL! Some things brought to his attention with my newborn were completely dismissed and he said (more than once), ""who cares"". He was very dismissive and did not even want to listen to me and my husband, did not seem to care - we went to a specialist for what we asked about and got the care we needed for our child. I would NOT suggest going to see this doctor unless you are desperate!"
10,Dr. Marcus E. Degraw,Detroit,Michigan, Pediatricians , Male,6,4.58,2011-03-16T14:17:44Z,5,5,5,5,5,Very nice doc. Was great with my kids. Allows me to email him even on vacation and responds quickly. Some parking issues but overall office is great!

13,Dr. Melinda E. Karam,Roseville,Michigan, Pediatricians , Female,4,4.88,2015-09-08T14:53:48.726Z,5,5,5,5,5,"We love this practice! Dr. Karam is a go-getter. Should you ever find yourself in the hospital with a sick child, you will be happy that mama bear is there for your kiddo. We have been taking our children to Eastlake Peds for 15 years and we are very happy."
14,Dr. Melinda E. Karam,Roseville,Michigan, Pediatricians , Female,4,4.88,2015-05-09T20:27:57.902Z,4.8,5,4,5,5,"Love love love them all. My two teenage boys are so comfortable in this atmosphere it is going to be hard when we have to leave. Over the last 15 years I have never felt as if I was a bother to them when I called with questions about my children's health. They always take care of whatever need you have. The staff for the most part have been the same and is just as caring as all 3 doctors.
"
15,Dr. Melinda E. Karam,Roseville,Michigan, Pediatricians , Female,4,4.88,2014-07-11T15:12:28Z,5,5,5,5,5,"I have 3 children and they all went to Dr. Karam, Dr. Roi, and Dr. Sobocinski until they were too old for pediatricians--they all begged to stay. There is not enough positive I can say about each doctor in this group. They hesitated to find the best specialists. They all were patient, and made sure both parent and child had a full understanding of exactly what was being done. The staff treated everyone like family; and were kind, sympathetic and informative when called about any concerns; giving an appointment for that day if needed, yet they rarely ran late despite the squeezed in appointments.Unless your more than 15 minutes early or late, you were usually called in less than 10 to 15 minutes---even during cold and flu season!! I've recommended this pediatric group to so many people, and every one of them stayed with that practice until their children ""graduated"" beyond pediatricians. Did I meantion that they are WONDERFUL with adolescents?"
16,Dr. Melinda E. Karam,Roseville,Michigan, Pediatricians , Female,4,4.88,2011-08-10T18:04:54Z,4.8,5,4,5,5,"Great all around. Knowledgeable, fun and terrific with kids. Dr Karam and staff have gone above and beyond for me and my kids on several occasions to be sure we were best cared for. Cant say enough good things"
17,Dr. D. Nicolas Doss,Dearborn,Michigan, Pediatricians , Male,5,4.63,2014-10-14T10:38:41.443Z,4.8,4,5,5,5,Dr Doss is great. He actually makes my children feel comfortable and not afraid of going to the doctors office. He addresses any concerns they my wife and I may have and he's unbelievably patient.
18,Dr. D. Nicolas Doss,Dearborn,Michigan, Pediatricians , Male,5,4.63,2011-04-13T10:47:08Z,4,1,5,5,5,Best Medical Doctor I have ever seen but the henry ford staff is a joke
19,Dr. D. Nicolas Doss,Dearborn,Michigan, Pediatricians , Male,5,4.63,2009-01-10T13:50:13Z,5,5,5,5,5,"I have to say... I love Dr. Doss as my daughter's pediatritian. He is so caring and I can tell that he truely enjoys his job. When someone enjoys thier job, they actually do a better job. He actually sits with you during the visit and addresses any concerns you may have. I never felt as though he wanted to just get in and get out of the visit. Would highly reccomend him to anyone I know. He is very polite and very knoweledgable. He told me always to follow my instict as a mother even if I didnt agree with him... and if I leave the office and I feel as though something isn't right to bring my daughter right back to the clinic. He said that I am spending more time with her than he is and if I feel as though something is not right to always trust my instint. It is nice to know that there is a doctor that doesnt think he is a know it all. He is very knowledgable and I am so happy to have him as my daughters doctor!"
20,Dr. D. Nicolas Doss,Dearborn,Michigan, Pediatricians , Male,5,4.63,2008-06-23T17:10:57Z,4.8,4,5,5,5,He's the best. Very funny. Keeps the kids laughing and smiling while talking about Spongebob Squarepants. He is genuinely interested in the children and a delight to be around.
21,Dr. D. Nicolas Doss,Dearborn,Michigan, Pediatricians , Male,5,4.63,2007-04-07T17:52:46Z,5,,5,5,5,"Dr. Doss has been my children't dr for 5.5 yrs. He's very friendly animated, gives my children academic encouragement, and is always funny! Dr. Doss pulls up a chair and VISITS. He takes parents concerns seriously, and is the most compassionate pediatrician I've ever come across. Sadly, when my daughter turned 18, she had to go to a different doctor. My son wants to continue with Dr. Doss even after he turns 18! ;) He's that good."
22,Dr. Neelima S. Acharya,Detroit,Michigan, Pediatricians , Female,3,4.92,2014-08-10T04:04:58.335Z,4.8,5,4,5,5,Wonderful doctor. Very knowledgeable. Very good bedside manners. Highly recommend her!

25,Dr. Jacqueline P. Moore,Royal Oak,Michigan, Pediatricians , Female,2,5,2013-04-05T10:35:41Z,5,5,5,5,5,Wonderful doctor! She is the primary physician for both of my daughters. We have been with her since they were both very young. She is knowledgeable whenever they have a health issue and keeps me informed and worry free. I only wish we could keep her services after the kids are grown. She is the best in her field!
26,Dr. Jacqueline P. Moore,Royal Oak,Michigan, Pediatricians , Female,2,5,2009-07-02T14:38:29Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Moore is excellent. Staff is fast and courteous. She is professional, provides excellent explaination of results, personable, nice bed-side manner, and gains confidence of the children."

He always finds the right things to focus on and avoids unnecessary medicines and procedures. very helpful and caring.
30,Dr. Sudershan K. Grover,Detroit,Michigan, Pediatricians , Male,6,4.17,2010-06-14T18:54:32Z,3,3,1,3,5,"My mother choose this doctor for my siblings and I. I hated the wait we always had. Even worse when I broke out in a severe rash, they closed earlier than they ever had on the day I needed to go in. I switched my doctors that same day. They seemed to be so unpunctual."
31,Dr. Sudershan K. Grover,Detroit,Michigan, Pediatricians , Male,6,4.17,2009-03-13T06:17:56Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Very helpful with scheduling around our busy lives on numerous occasions. Staff is always friendly and courteous. When my 2 week old son began panting like a dog, Dr. Grover did exactly what was needed to diagnose the life threatening problem and resolve it. Dr. Grover does not overreact to emotional and hyper parents worried about their children, which in my book, is the correct behavior, but could be construed by emotionally distraught parents as not caring or unconcerned. This is not the case."
32,Dr. Sudershan K. Grover,Detroit,Michigan, Pediatricians , Male,6,4.17,2007-04-26T19:33:00Z,5,,5,5,5,"Dr. Grover was WONDERFULLY patient with me as a single teenage mother of 2 babies.

34,Dr. Sudershan K. Grover,Detroit,Michigan, Pediatricians , Male,6,4.17,2006-05-30T10:16:39Z,1.7,,3,1,1,"Condescending, disrespectful. My son was ill, and the Dr. was treating me like a fool telling me that nothing was wrong and to ""stop worrying"". After taking my son to the hospital, it turns out he really WAS very sick and ended up staying there 3 days. Dr Grover even yelled at the admitting staff telling the lady ""just admit the damn child"". This happened in 1998, but the sting of it is still there."
35,Dr. Leigh Flore,Detroit,Michigan, Pediatricians , Female,2,4.88,2017-04-26T18:52:26.859Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Excellent clinician, kind and smart. Would highly recommend to others"

The staff is great and they can always get you in and the wait is never long. My only concern is that my child has special needs that I felt needed to be addressed. He didn't seem like he wanted to address them. So, I went on my own to a specialist and low and behold, I was right!"
38,Dr. Fakhruddin S. Kapadia,Detroit,Michigan, Pediatricians , Male,2,4.75,2010-10-19T07:30:46Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Seen new pt for sport physical same day, Doctor has gotten on the phone with me."
39,Dr. Shamim Islam,Detroit,Michigan, Pediatricians , Female,3,4,2012-09-20T10:26:39Z,5,5,5,5,5,"I am so grateful for a doctor that cares. I took my grandson to a local emergency room hospital where the ER doctor spent five minutes if that looking at this child and came up with the most ridiculous diagnosis, I was so angry when I left, I think I know more than that doctor! Thank goodness for Dr.Islam, she took her time and figured it out. She is so polite (how nice in a society where rudeness seems to rule), and her years of experience and knowledge makes her one of the best doctors I have met."
40,Dr. Shamim Islam,Detroit,Michigan, Pediatricians , Female,3,4,2008-04-04T12:32:34Z,3.8,4,3,4,4,"I agree with the prior poster, as my 6 month old had jaundice and we went through numerous bilirubin tests and ended up going to the hospital where they didnt let me nurse. I failed at BF and found out after that it's normal. That said, I love Dr. Islam! She is very sweet and knowledgable. I found her to be a little old fashioned though."
41,Dr. Shamim Islam,Detroit,Michigan, Pediatricians , Female,3,4,2008-02-07T06:42:18Z,3.3,5,3,3,2,"I love this doctors personality and gentleness with my kids. However I was disturbed that at my youngest childs 2 week check up Dr. Islam seemed overly concerned about her jaundice even though I expressed that we were exclusively breastfeeding. She wanted to continue tracking her bilirubin (even though we had already done a couple of tests which were all fine) and tried to insist to me that I needed to add formula to help flush the jaundice. My daughter was gaining weight fantastically and did not need the additional fluid. Jaundice is very common, ""normal"" in breastfed babies (I've had 3 prior, so I know from personal experience as well) I refused more bilirubin testing and refused to feed formula for the sake of the jaundice and by a month old she had cleared it on her own with no problems. My friend also saw this doctor and was pushed around too for the same thing and she fell for it (first time mom) and then failed at breastfeeding, so sad!"
42,Dr. Hemalata Reddy,Detroit,Michigan, Pediatricians , Female,3,3.92,2011-03-15T23:59:31Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Reddy is wonderful! I was actually referred to her before my daughter was born by my co-worker. Dr. Reddy has been very caring and knowledgeable about my daughters care and follow up treatments. I can even reach her personally at home during off times outside of regular business hours, and for me, that meant alot as a 1st time mom:) I work within the Detroit Medical Center and finding her is very convenient and central to most locations... I find her staff very friendly, competent, and genuinely down to earth and would recommend anyone seeking a caring and loving pediatrician!"
43,Dr. Hemalata Reddy,Detroit,Michigan, Pediatricians , Female,3,3.92,2009-05-06T10:26:43Z,4,1,5,5,5,I hate her wait staff. She is very rude on the phone when trying to schedule appointments. She attempted to charge me a co-pay when I didn't have one. I think she was trying to pocket the money. This doctor will lose me if she don't get another receptionist.
44,Dr. Hemalata Reddy,Detroit,Michigan, Pediatricians , Female,3,3.92,2009-03-08T18:59:09Z,2.8,3,4,2,2,Diagnosis everything as asthma...

47,Dr. Virginia Delaney-Black,Detroit,Michigan, Pediatricians , Female,1,5,2010-05-20T13:09:42Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Virginia Delaney-Black is the most compassionate Dr. that I know. She was so knowledgable and helpful to us as our baby was so critically ill. Our son is 17yrs. old and is post ECMO and thriving! He wants to go become a physician and help people also. His experiences with all the people that have touched his life in one way or the other, has had a huge impact on him in his life! Staying in contact for many years with us has also meant the WORLD to us as a family. The caring of this physician is how it is suppose to be! Unfortunatly, that isn't always the case. The fellows that follow her are learning from one of the very best! Making our whole family understand what was happening to our son was very important. Making herself available for questions at anytime was so helpful. I would rate this physician with the highest rating that was available! CHM downtown is were everyones child that needs medical attetion needs to go!!"
48,Dr. Ashutosh Raina,Detroit,Michigan, Pediatricians , Male,1,5,2007-12-06T18:28:18Z,5,5,5,5,5,Knows his stuff. Taught me (most of) what I know!

She was my doctor since birth and has been for the last 18 years. I'm now 20 and I wish that I was still able to see her.

He is a cancer survivor himself and has a great understanding from the patient’s perspective.

75,Dr. Shyran J. Hines,Detroit,Michigan, Pediatricians , Female,1,4.75,2011-01-17T11:59:15Z,4.8,5,4,5,5,"Dr. Shyran Hines is my primary doctor, She is Intelligent and compassionate. She was the first to diagnose my cancer. My father was a doctor, I understand what make up a good caring physician. I intend to keep seeing he for consultations and care. I have seen her several times. I will continue to have her as my doctor. I am confident in her judgments and the care she gives. She take the needed time to explain any question I have so I don't mind the wait, Im sure she is doing the same for the paitent before me."

Khambete,Detroit,Michigan, Pediatricians , Female,4,2.94,2012-05-15T10:18:44Z,2.3,1,2,2,4,"Dr. Khambete herself seemed to be a great doctor and my wife and I were extremely happy with the care she gave our infant son (2007-2009). Her biggest problem is her office staff. Nurses were OK and don't have an opinion on them either way. But the front desk was horrible. Simply put -rude, becasue explatives aren't approriate here. Zero personality, positive addtitude, or compasion for the situation. Working with them to schdule an appointment or get infomation was more of a bother then their chosen profession. This being the small stuff was only the tip of the iceberg compared to the hundreds (maybe thousand+, don't recall exactly) of dollars it cost us out of pocket because they miss charged BCBS for well baby visits vs. sick visits. We spend hundreds of $$$ on things normally covered by insurance but weren't because of the way they billed them. Zero help in resolving it also. Dr. Khambete would do best by her practice by re-staffing the office with better people."
78,Dr. Devyani S. Khambete,Detroit,Michigan, Pediatricians , Female,4,2.94,2009-08-17T15:19:41Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Khambete is one of the best doctors I have come to know. She is very patient and spends a lot of time with us at our visits with both my daughter and son. She has been seeing my daughter since she was born 5 years ago and my 11 month old as well. Her partner, Dr. Sivaram is also very pleasant and patient. This practice also gives back to the community by offering a day for the uninsured for free services - don't see many doctors doing that."
79,Dr. Devyani S. Khambete,Detroit,Michigan, Pediatricians , Female,4,2.94,2009-03-12T10:24:11Z,2.5,3,1,3,3,"I like Dr. Khambete herself but maybe not enough to stay at her office. Her parner, Dr. Sivari (SP??) misdiagnosed my daughter with scarlet feaver in the fall. We never did find out what was really wrong with her. I usually spend at least 30-45 minutes in the waiting room and another 30-45 minutes in the exam room just to spend a rushed 5 minutes with the doctor, this is always very frustrating trying to keep a toddler happy and occupied in such a small space for such a small time and it makes me dread going there. The nurses are all nice, but the desk staff isn't too great. Last week I called to make an appointment and was put on hold for 5 minutes until I finally gave up and hung up. She was referred to me by my old OB/GYN who delivered my daughter, I hated that doctor so maybe I was dumb to take a referral from her."

He makes it fun for the kids so that they are not afraid. He answers all of you rquestions, doesn't give you any kind of run around answers and he is sooooo gentle with the kids. Not to mention he was my dr when I was younger. He was just starting out when he was my dr and when I walked in he says ""I feel old my kids are having kids"". He is a wonderful wonderful man, the medical world could not ask for anyone better."

She asked if he ever struggled to fall asleep and before we could finish talking she insisted that we take him off of all meds and try ABA Therapy. Our son has been in ABA for over two years and is THRIVING with everything together. She would’ve known had she asked the questions. Also he will chatter with himself a little before he falls asleep but I wouldn’t call it insomnia. We sat there silently in awe in the beginning and ended with her asking what we wanted from her. I said this is just a follow up for his new meds. I’m still dumbfounded. I don’t think that neurology is her calling and perhaps she should try a more holistic approach as a profession like selling essential oils considering she openly doesn’t believe in modern medicine. 🤷‍♀️
89,Dr. Fatema J. Serajee,Detroit,Michigan, Pediatricians , Female,2,2,2013-07-08T12:03:08Z,1.8,3,2,1,1,"This doctor will not take the time to explain what is going on with your child. She will never return your calls when you child is having trouble. She will have a nurse call you with any test results and she doesn't let her nurses know what needs to be done as a follow up. You are left in the dark. As I said also no matter how serious your childs problem is she will not return you calls, we have since changed doctors due to waiting for weeks with no return calls."
90,Dr. Tor Adam Shwayder,Detroit,Michigan, Pediatricians , Male,1,2,2008-02-16T00:41:33Z,2,3,3,1,1,"Very unhappy with this doctor. He advises using lindane on children with headlice, even brags he used it on his children and pregnant wife !!!http://www.lindane.com/pdf/shwayder_07.pdf"

Needs more experience to help babies! Rather wait in the ER than go to him! Also very over-confident in his demeanor, even though he does not know much."
93,Dr. Douglas E. Henry,Detroit,Michigan, Pediatricians , Male,1,1.75,2008-10-14T22:37:48Z,1.8,1,2,2,2,"At Children’s Hospital his staff is extremely unprofessional. I was in a severe car accident in 2006, I was 17. I was in a coma for several weeks, and suffered numerous life threatening and changing conditions. For one “Foot Drop” there was actually a cure (surgery performed within 6 months of the accident). My family and I asked him for months (7) and he said that there was nothing. Finally my father insisted that I see a specialist (Neurosurgeon). Within 5 minutes she said that we needed to perform sudden surgery because it was already 1 month “past due.” I had the surgery and I was blessed as my nerve came back. Thankfully we went to someone else, if we had not, I would have to live with this condition for the rest of my life. By the way, my Neurosurgeon was Dr. Gilmer Hill, I think her name has “changed” to Dr. Gilmer or Dr. Hill. She was absolutely fantastic! Hope this helps, please see an expert, not just this general doctor that knows very little about a whole lot."
