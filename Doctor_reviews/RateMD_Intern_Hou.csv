0,Dr. Jonathan M. Magid,Houston,Texas,internist-geriatrician, Male,17,4.84,2018-05-03T19:51:26.725Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Medical Clinic of Houston is a fantastic facility with a stellar reputation. My Physician, Dr. Magid is incredible in that he is extremely professionally astute with regards to current medical research. He also willingly and consistently takes the time to write handwritten notes to follow up with patients to explain their health status after tests are completed. Even the parking attendants are warm and personable.
The two receptionists/billing agents in radiology, however, appear to cut off the personable atmosphere by spouting out scripted instructions in a way that demonstrates a complete disconnect with the human experience. The two who were on staff at 3pm on 5/3 were unable to make one second of eye contact with me as they quickly barked out orders of ""change down there and wait here, etc. I thought it was my sole perception until the next patient wondered down the hall looking as confused as was I about the dressing room instructions. Sounds small, but appears to be a hugely different institution on that floor, shutting down the wonderful professional interaction prior to arriving at reception on the 1st floor. "

My husband went in for an annual physical exam and they ran routine blood tests. We weren't informed of any other additional tests being performed but we received a bill to the amount of $115. No explanations. When we contacted our insurance they informed us of the doctor's office running additional blood work not covered under routine annual physical. When I called, the staff was least helpful. We weren't informed why those tests were being performed nor why we weren't informed at the time of the tests. Better find another clinic where they don't treat patients as customers and are genuinely concerned about their health. I will not recommend Medical Clinic of Houston."

As other posters have stated: he will not give up on finding your problem. He has the patience of a saint. He is the type of doctor that I drive over 45 minutes to see- just because the quality of care is that good. I would absolutely without a doubt recommend Dr. Magid to anyone.

My first appointment went well. She was listening to some of the concerns I had. After taking my blood testing she went up on my dosage. When I went back for my second visit , my blood results had not changed much, she asked me if I had been taking my medicine and when I said yes she said ""Well, I'm not going to say you are lying but the blood results show otherwise""......excuse me? Why would I lie about taking my medication when I KNOW my blood results will show if I have been taking it. She kept me on the same dosage despite my complaints that I wasn't feeling better. I stayed on that medication for 2 more months until I took another blood test and the results were the EXACT SAME. She upped my dosage again and I still wasn't feeling as good as I know I can and should. When I went to my next appointment I tried to talk to her about a few natural options to help control my thyroid levels (since I would like to try and get pregnant soon) she would barely even let the words come out of my mouth. She even refused to listen to some of my symptoms and told me they weren't symptoms of my illness, although I know for a fact they are. At that point I completely stopped going to her. I found a new endocrinologist from lots of recommendations from others I know suffering from hypothyroidism. I'm hoping I will have a better experience and actually have a dr. who likes to listen to their patients and treat them like human beings!"

Several of my doctors had recommended Dr. Jogi , but he was booked for two months. I took an appointment with Dr. Juarez because she was available asap. She is the worst doctor I have ever seen. I could handle the lack of bedside manner and for awhile try to believe she had to be properly trained due the the office she was in, but after my last appointment when she said and I quote "" although you feel terrible maybe you should realize this might be your new standard of living"".

She is simply amazing and very caring even though she is so busy and sees patients non-stop. Her knowledge is vast and she listens to you and works ""with"" you. Agree with others her front office reception needs an overhaul and customer service training. And it's enough to make you not want to even go there what you have to go through to get an appointment with short attitude of those on the front end. But once your in and as long as your friendly things go just fine with the staff. I think they are overworked and need more or different people working the front for a better experience.

I hear amazing things about Dr. Salvato, but it is completely ruined by her rude and unprofessional staff.

I am simply writing to express my disappointment in her staff, particularly Maria in billing. I booked this new patient appt 3 mos ago. The day before my appt at 345 (they close at 5), I noticed that I had a missed call on my cell phone. I call the number back and talk to Maria, who informs me that my insurance is ""inactive"" and that the PCP name is not Dr. Salvato. I tell her that no, that's not correct, I have the cards, and it says Dr. Salvato right on it. She continues to tell me that it is inactive , so I tell her that I have to call BCBS, but by this time it is 448, and there is no way I can get this resolved before they close at 5. She tells me that once I get it resolved that I can let them know at my appt. I call a supervisor at BCBS and let them know what 's going on and we get it resolved. There is a mishap with the premium and Healthcare.gov screwed up my premium payment , so it shows that I owe more than I do. I have to send in an appeal to get this resolved. But because it still shows that I owe more on my premium payment,. Today, after I drove in from Katy and explained this to a very unfriendly Maria, she said that I cannot use my insurance because it's a 50/50 chance that it won't get paid. I put BCBS supervisor Jason on the phone with her to assure her that this claim will be paid, and she still refuses me. I took the day off without pay for this appt. If I would have been advised of this even a few days before the appt, I could've gotten this resolved. She was the most unfriendly person I have had to deal with and basically I left feeling like this office cares more about $ than patient care. I am hoping that this whole inconvenience and terrible treatment is a blessing in disguise and that I am meant to find a doctor office who cares about patients and helping them instead of doing the opposite. Dr. Salvato may be a great doctor, but I will never have the chance to find out, as I am never stepping foot in that office again. Btw, it is a good thing that I decided to call back the missed call #, because she didn't even leave a message, or try to call my home #."

She is very caring and has helped me so much with my fibromyalgia. She is always up on the latest, and shares copies of the clinical literature in her office. I recently had to move out of state and I don't think I will ever find a doctor as good as she is. I ask my current doctor here to talk with her and she was able to explain to him where I was with my meds and various diagnoses. My brother recently went to her and he has been very impressed. after reviewing all the symptoms and looking at the blood test, she determined he had Rocky Mountain spotted fever and has been treating him. In summary, I feel like she is a superb Doctor. The office seems a bit disorganized at times. I think because they are just so busy and also they have student physician assistants there. That would be my only complaint. "

I agree with what others said about him being an excellent listener and friendly, but that is where it ends for me. I think our personality styles clash because his style of communication is a bit rough around the edges. Tone came across as stern and yelling, but I'm sure that is not the way he meant it to be. I've had issues with this clinic in the past so it is not all his fault. I got there and was told I was there for an annual physical, which is not what I made the appointment for, but I humored them and did it anyway. Then they didn't even do everything they said they do for annual physical: no blood work, no bone density, etc. I made the appointment just to get referrals renewed. This should have been an in/out thing. He tells me he will renew the referrals and I must come in every 3 months to see him....really. I only see my specialist 1-2 times a year for follow-ups. Only purpose I can see in 3 month follow-ups for no medical problems is greed for co-pays. Then when I 'm checking out check-out/referral women tells me ""He didn't put referrals in his notes"". I told her ""He told me he was going to renew them."" and I had to argue with her about it. Pinelock Medical Clinic is the WORST medical office I have ever dealt with and I will be shopping for a new PCP."

I've met his wife and children and they are all very nice and sweet. He gives excellent care. He is always there and answers his phone calls. I could get ahold of him if I had to.

Approximately 9 years ago I contacted a foot ulcer on both of my heels. I was introduced into the Kindred hospital via the clinic under doctor Memon. Because of my diabetes, which I was diagnosed in 1998, I had to be admitted into Kindred hospital. I first met Dr. Loya in 2008. He has, in my opinion, the most friendly and knowledgeable inpatient care. I found myself in and out of Kindred Hospital because of the reoccurring condition of both heels and the infection in my foot. Each time I was admitted for IV therapy that usually ran approximately 3-6 weeks, I was immediately under the care of Dr. Loya. Whatever the situation or complication of the IV therapy took place, Dr. Loya was right there making modified changes in medication to correct or better the condition. Anytime I had a question, Dr. Loya was right there to answer them to my satisfaction. At the end of each hospital stay he would talk with me, making sure that if I had any questions he would answer them. Doctors in general tend to have education in his field, but Dr. Loya exceeded those situations. He is the most compassionate, friendly, knowledgable, professional doctor that I have ever met. Genuinely, I would not do ratings or reviews or even suggest a situation, or in this case, doctors, to other people., but for Dr. Loya I will. Anyone I come into contact with, I would and will, not have any problem whatsoever suggesting they ask for Dr. Munir Loya as a physician. He has always made my stay here at Kindred warm and peaceful with kind words. I would shake his hand each year upon my discharge from the Kindred hospital system. I don't look forward to coming into a hospital on a repeat basis, but when conditions are such where I would have to be readmitted I would make sure it would be Kindred Clear Lake where I know I will be under his care.

He is a team player and listens to me. That makes me feel good about his service because there were several doctors working on my case. It's important to have a doctor that can work that well with all the other doctors that were managing my care. He managed the team of doctors well and kept everyone informed. While I was at Kindred Clear Lake he would come see me in the day and the evenings. This is my second go around with him. He would also follow me to the rehab hospital to see me there. I was happy about that because he knew my case and history and could continue to take care of me. He is always on point. If I was in pain, he really listened to me. Even if the nurse had to call him to tell him over the phone, he would make sure I was taken care of and had what I needed. Some other doctors wait until they round, or assume they know what I'm going through. Dr. Loya was good about listening to what I was going through and took action to deal with it. If I had to go back to the hospital, I would want him to continue seeing me. Your patient, Carl Baldwin"

Dr. Lisa is one of the best listeners and treatment professionals that I have encountered. Yes, I may have waited, but its worth it. She treats you like a person and not just a symptom. One may only wait because she cares and takes time out to actually talk to each person.

Her assistant Angie never replies or calls back after constantly leaving voicemails. She has the worst attitude and its obvious she has her favorite patients, whom are her friends. You pay 180 home fee to be seen and to get services you pay for. Yet, when you need to be seen no one ever calls back. I had to show up at the office to be able to get an appointment. I say its a waste of time and money. Nonetheless, Dr. Bui is not competent in her specialty. I had a rash that she couldn't diagnose and needed another doctor to come in to see it. Honestly this doctor is not worth your time or your money. One last thing, while I waited in room for her to see me, all I could hear was Dr Bui and Angie gossip about patients and a doctor Feujer. I feel sorry for whoever that other doctor is because that is unethical. I work in finance and know very little about medicine but, I know that is violating patients privacy.

We moved to Boulder, CO, and miss her more than words can say. We very seriously considered retaining her as our PCP, and commuting to Houston for appointments. In the end, the likely complications with seeing specialists made us decide to find a local doctor. Dr. Bui set such a high standard that we are finding it a great challenge to find another physician that we feel can meet our needs as well as she did.

She knows what she's doing and always calls the pateint back with labs.I've seen many many doctors before, and she's one of the best! Just remember to arrive to your appt on time. She doesn't like it when patients are late, which in turn makes it fabulous for those on time - only about 5 minutes to actually see Dr. Bui!"

123,Dr. James M. Carroll,Houston,Texas,Internist / Geriatrician, Male,4,5,2011-05-28T00:47:44Z,5,5,5,5,5,"An excellent provider of both acute care - ""I'm sick, make me better"" and chronic care - ""I'm stuck with this illness but wanna live as best I can""; Dr. Carroll was formerly with Legacy Community Clinic where he learned a LOT about HIV and other health needs specific to the gay community. He is understanding, very knowledgeable and willing to work within a patients financial limitations. He is also very up to date on Men's Health issues and treatment & cooperative with referrals to other providers. Also noteworthy is that his office is very close to being paperless... he doesn't walk in with a chart / file, it's a laptop and all Rx activity goes to the pharmacy from said laptop - his office also utilizes a very slick patient portal program for viewing lab results and the like online. Very Highly Recommended, without reservation... free parking to boot."

She found some vitamin deficiencies that my old PCP had missed for years. It really got me on track to feeling better. She also switched around some of my long term medications and it made a dramatic improvement in my overall health and energy level. She referred me to some great specialists also. Dr. Awad is easily accessible by email and I like her online system of being able to view all my health information in one place (meds, lab results, office visits, appointments). I highly recommend her. "

She worked my son into her schedule on an urgent basis. After examining and diagnosing him, she explained the situation and sent us straight to ER having arranged a wheelchair for my son. While we were in transit she called the attending ER physician who was thus expecting and prepared for us (according to the ER doc most physicians do not take that time). We feel very fortunate to have Dr Awad for our doctor."

Awad for a physical. She came in with a frown on her face, haughty scolding me for being in a time slot for workings. I had no clue - addressed probelm I was having, a close personal friend is a patient she made a slanderous remark about my friend laughed thinking she was funny. Despensed meds for my issue turns out the medication was discontinued, I did not get the physical her staff did not schedule me in a place where there was time or so she stated. I drove into the city for a physical I had not had in 2 years waited 1 hr. and came away with discontinuued meds. This doctor treated another friend 3 yrs ago who was diagnosed with cancer of the tongue in a vist at that time I informed her of diagnose her comment about my friend was to say she was sure the woman was crazy. I blame myself for going back."

She barely examined me, was curt and rude. She took an incomplete medical history and I had to remind her to do some of her examination. She prescribed medicine based on an incorrect test analysis. She never explained my diagnosis but instead had a nurse call me and the nurse just told me to take some medicine without any explanation. I went to another specialist who told me that Dr. Awad's diagnosis was completely wrong, and that she had misinterpreted my test results. When I wrote to Dr. Awad to tell her what had occurred, her response was curt and rude. She never apologized or acknowledged her errors. Her staff was also very rude"

She makes sure she gets all the information before giving a diagnosis; she is very honest about what she knows and what she does not know. Even in the latter case she tries to help referring you to a Dr. she thinks may be able to help.She does not dismiss any questions or concerns you may have, which I think is very important to establish a good patient-doctor relationship."

You schedule an appointment with him, but when you get to his office you find out you will only see one of his Registered Nurses.

She prescribed me medication for an infection without even physically examining me. She also provided additional medication for another infection (why??) without doing an examination. Her reasoning? She ""listened"" to me talk about my symptoms so I have to be correct about what's going on with my body right? Who is the doctor here her or me? Isn't that what we go to Doctors for? For them to verify with examinations things that we THINK are going on with us? Her staff members in the office are also RUDE and as clueless as she is. Do NOT go to this doctor. Worst experience EVER in my life. "

We have referred many of our friends to her and everyone has been embraced by Dr.Aslam as if they were her only patient.

The clinic nurse called me to see if I had been contacted by Dr. Aslams office to come in again, and I said no. We made the appt and I ended up having a breast biopsy. I was told the results would be delivered to the Dr. in 7-10 days. I was anxious as my Mother died from breast cancer and my sister was recently diagnosed. I called FIVE times over a 2 weeek period after the 10 day limit, spoke to her nurse each time who said she would get my results and call me back. Never heard a word. After a month, I finally called the clinic myself, who said they had faxed my results to the Dr's office weeks and days ago. They told me my results and I still havent heard from her office. I wont be returning, how awful to leave a patient hanging like that."

I was recently diagnosed with Crohn's Disease and she treated me in the hospital (along with a team of GIs and surgeons) after a flare up.

I was diagnosed with rosacea, which I didn't know I had. To say the least, I was surprised. Dr Karimjee prescribed a medicated cream which I have been using and it has helped tremendously.
I also told him I had tremors, which I have had since I was young and he also prescribed some medication for that ailment. The medication worked and it has helped.
I am glad I found Dr. Karimjee. He is a caring, compassionate doctor who knows his stuff."

We only use them because of insurance .....EXTREMELY LONG waiting time. VERY rude office staff. I just need a referall and that seems IMPOSSIBLE from this office. Sam Houston Clinic in Huntsville. They have stopped my husband eith only leg after amputation from getting a light weight chair chair...due to the fact that they filed the paper work in his folder rather than reading it for Drs. signature .i was in the clinics yesterday and they actually called my phone while I was waiting in a room !!! Now that is professional ? I have called my insurance Begging for another Dr. Hopefully I will get to change soon. I do hope that this review will encourage you to STAY clear if you have a choice.

As a retired nurse,when the Government walks in to audit records for narcotics,you better have every I dotted and every T crossed! Now think about how long it takes a doctor to become an M.D. After all this training,money put into school,days and nights running together for days without sleep WOULD YOU WANT TO LOSE YOUR LICENSE?

We've been with him almost since he opened practice, however, as his practice gets bigger he hires staff who don't have/don't demonstrate the same patient care philosophy & the quality of sevice is suffering. The clinic we're at requires a very long wait (usually over 1 hour) & the PA's abrupt acting as if she's made up her mind as to what's wrong & how she'll treat your ""condition"" before she even walks in. When on the phone, even when we identify ourselves by DOB, Name & Ins. they never get us straight & give us answers to questions we haven't asked for conditions that aren't in our health regime. During a family crisis they would NOT listen would NOT make even the slightest effort to assist us; this isn't the kind of doc Dr. Karimjee has always been & it's a shame to see his reputation tarnished this way. His office staff looses records, promises to call in med. refills & fails to do so; if Dr. Karimjee only knew what was going on"

He has taken an hour one time to consult with my elderly mom and explain medications and how he planned to treat her condition. She loves him and I do too.

I have Hashimotos and Fibromyalgia. I had seen several doctors prior to being referred to Dr. Karimjee. After my first visit I knew I had an answer to my prayers. He gave me his full attention when I discussed my symptoms and concerns. He took the time to explain my problem and answered all of my questions. He will repeat anything you do not understand, unlike most doctors who look at you like you are stupid when you do not understand medical terms. Yes, you may wait longer to see him but it's because he spends time with each patient because he genuinely CARES for you! So have patience, your turn will come! Since he does listen & has a true concern in helping you, I have been so much better. He is treating my problems and not throwing an anti-depressant at me like others had because they thought it was all in my head. NO, it wasn't, the proof was on the test results that Dr. Karimjee took the time to take!"

We really loved having him as our Dr., but could not afford the pricey initiation fees associated with MDVIP ($1500 per person per year). Wish we could - we miss Dr. Burpeau! If you can afford MDVIP, then take a hard look at Dr. Burpeau as your provider - he is great!!"

I was thrilled to find that he is on my new insurance provider's list. Unfortunately, I can't afford to join his concierge plan right now. My experiences with him were great. He really takes the time to talk to and get to know his patients. It's unfortunate that health care in this country is such that he needs to implement such a plan in order to practice his excellent form of medicine."

He is always comforting, ready to listen with a caring attitude/heart. He encouraged me concerning diabetes and hypertension. He tried heading me towards being in control/better health. He is always there when needed by giving me his business card making himself available via phone,text, or email. That in itself is comforting. He is an instrument used to bring healing to my infected toe that I almost lost. I thank the Lord for that healing. Dr. William J. McKee is special to me because he made me feel special.

He chose to ignore them and took the one reading in the office and declined my request for additional meds.

I've never sat in the waiting room for more than five minutes, yet when he is seeing me, it feels like I'm his only patient as he takes so much time really trying to understand my problem. He is very knowledgeable and always seems to ask the right questions. He managed to get a testosterone problem under control that I had seen other physicians for, but hadn't found the level of success with... but he didn't stop with my testosterone being at the right levels, he looked further to see what possible causes of the low T could be. He is just a solid doctor, he and his staff are friendly and courteous, not to mention so sweet to my baby when he tags along on an appointment, and they just moved into a shiny new office... what more could you want?"

He is caring, smart, polite and punctual. Some people are not happy with how often he orders lab tests, but I do not see it as a problem. In my opinion, he is being very thoughtful and prudent in gathering enough data to enable accurate diagnosis. His nurse and receiptionist, the same ladies who had worked for him for years, had always been very helpful and caring. However, he now has new staff whom I have not seen yet. The time will tell.."

Thought I had found someone I was going to like and would listen to my concerns.. This turned out to be a forever battle to get lab results and test results. Dr Sun-Wright was more concerned with paper work than treating patients. Her nurse is rude when she does return your phone call. If they make a mistake when sending in your prescription during your visit, they will not respond to the pharmacy calls. I have since found a new physician and was surprised when I had a call the next day from her nurse with my lab results ."

However, she gave me a prescription that did not work, so she offered a second prescription in hopes that one would be more effective.

You will have to wait no matter what time your appointment, but I appreciate that she's listening to her other patients as attentively as she listens to me. And the wait is well worth the quality of care: I traveled abroad a year ago and given my history with DVTs, she prescribed a preventive dosage anticoagulant for me to take on my trip. When I got back, I had a leg ultrasound and sure enough, it showed a DVT. Had she not prescribed the preventive dose I'm not sure I'd be here today. She's simply the best. "
237,Dr. Ana Blackmon,Houston,Texas,Internist / Geriatrician, Female,4,4.56,2009-08-17T10:28:42Z,4.8,5,4,5,5,My wife was referred to Dr. Blackmon when she could not get a logical answer from another doctor. She was amazingly wonderful she found a way to tell my wife some things she did not want to hear and got her to agree to try. My wife is almost as stubborn as I am. Dr. Blackmon took a lot of time with her and LISTENED and did not blowoff her complaints. She was very through in her workup. She has helped my wife get better from a very bad chronic illness. She has gotten better and has be able to come off all but two of her medicines. I have sent 2 friends to Dr Blackmon who were talking like no one could figure out what was wrong. They both loved her although one was told he had some problems that were not medical and needed a psychiatrist. The other got a great full workup of the problem and got a real answer. She is just wonderful. We had to wait but good things are worth waiting for.
238,Dr. Ana Blackmon,Houston,Texas,Internist / Geriatrician, Female,4,4.56,2009-06-12T14:21:35Z,4,5,1,5,5,I loved Dr. Blackmon- and I consider myself an expert at doctors due to my numerous medical conditions that I wish I didn't have! She was very thorough and caring- much more proactive than any other primary doctor I have seen in 20 years. The only thing negative was the additional 70 minutes I waited past my appointment time. Dr. Blackmon was apologetic (more than most doctors I have been to) and I could see why she was so tardy after my appointment- she never looked at the time and took as long as it was necessary to hear about my case history. I recommend her.
239,Dr. Ana Blackmon,Houston,Texas,Internist / Geriatrician, Female,4,4.56,2009-02-13T04:23:03Z,4.8,5,4,5,5,"Dr. Blackmon is an excellent and caring doctor. She is very thorough and intelligent. I was glad to find her. I was bummed that they don't take BCBS, but the office does file with the insurance company for you, though you have to pay the full amount up front and then wait to get reimbursed."

For months I was experiencing some weird health problems, I saw 3 doctors who all told me there was nothing wrong with me. I was referred to Dr. Lipsen, who spoke with me for over 30 minutes and listened to my frustrations. He ACTUALLY cared and ran some tests, and gave me a real diagnosis. I could have gotten way sicker if I listened to the other docs. Highly recommended! Great bedside manner, but he was a little late to my appointment."

I was in a car accident in 2000 and he treated me for it .may i also add he put me on some strong pain killers for a while and never once told me that they were addictive . I called his office to tell them that when i didn't take the medicine he gave me i felt very sick . To make a long story short i got a certified letter in the mail a couple days later saying due to recent issues you have had with my office i wish to terminating our doctor patient relationship . I could not believe a doctor who i had gone to sine my childhood did that to me . He was scared because he got me addicted to the pain medicine and he thought he would get in trouble i guess ! It really hurt me that my own doctor would be so shallow ! I had never even heard of or taken a pain pill before he gave them to me !

For example, when treating me for depression, he didn't just write a prescription and leave it at that. He asked about my children and my general well-being, stress levels, and relationships. He gave both medication as well as recommending holistic remedies and therapists. The office staff was efficient. When making an appointment on the phone, I was directed to his assistant to answer my questions so as to be more prepared for the appointment (I needed to know if the blood tests I desired were fasting tests.) He tends to ramble a bit, and he tends to be late, but not more than other offices I have visited. Once I was accustomed to his particular personality, which took only a couple of visits, I felt comfortable and well cared for. Dr. Shaffer also continually attends educational programs and remains certified in certain fields each year in order to be aware of and proficient in current medical information."

She spends time with you and makes you feel like you are her only patient. She is very knowledgeable and compassionate and helped us believe in the medical profession again. We were very fortunate to have been referred to her.

I have liked her for physicals but the two times I have needed her in the last few years I was unable to get an appointment and was sent to the Emergency room. Neither were Emergency room issues but issues in which I needed to see a physician. Today I had an appointment but they decided to reschedule me because I had not been there in a while ( I cant get appointments) and needed a new patient appointment. Besides not leaving a message about this, they left me in the waiting room over 30 minutes and refused to let me speak with the doctor as she had patients with appointments. I got a call from them confirming my appointment and had no reason to suspect anything had changed. The office staff was rude and inflexible. She clearly has a busy practice and does not need me as a patient. I however was a bit more important when there were very few patients and I was having to go regularly for an issue. Disappointed!"

She is #1 doctor- 100% caring, integrity. There is none better for primary care doctor that Dr. Mundy. When she has had to refer me to specialist outside her office, they too have been A+ doctors. Dr. Mundy walks down the road with you in your wellness journeys, and the ONLY doctor I want as my Primary Care Dr. Her clinic has lab inside the clinic with great phelbotonomists. The front desk staff remember names, and are welcoming and caring. They interact with the patients to make them feel special and show they too- truly care about their patients. This is #1 clinic for Primary Care, with Dr. Mundy being the best of the best. She is AWESOME!"
259,Dr. Stephanie B. Mundy,Houston,Texas,Internist / Geriatrician, Female,5,4.3,2008-04-03T10:33:39Z,5,5,5,5,5,This doctor accepted me in 2 days when my own gynecologist found out I had diabetes. She is a great doctor with a very competent staff. I see her maybe once every month or two but am in contact with her almost weekly (via tests faxed by me to her office). I have been to her several times and have seen her within 10 minutes of my appointed time. I was particularly impressed with her friendliness and business like approach to my treatment. I highly recommend her to anyone that might be experiencing problems or need treatment for diabetes

He is NCQA certified in Diabetes, this is a very important credential to look for. He is very professional/competent/knowledgeable, he sends your prescription request in during the appointment, he notifies you of your test results soon as it is made available, very thorough, he listens to your concerns genuinely. I had always been an advocate of generics/cheaper brands of medications and he has always been willing to sit down and provide me with list of meds that are affordable. When I needed a referral he made sure that he provided me with the best doctors out there. I have recommended him to friends and so far everyone has been happy."

Rushed me out of his office. He did order some tests (all negative) and I had to call his office to get the results 10 days later. I felt he should have called me the day he go the test results. The only useful thing I got was a referral to another doctor. Waiting room was empty and now I know why. Apparently the other reviews were written by this doctor's staff."

He is as good as a Doctor can be. He is an excellent diagnostic practitioner, he can find out what is causing anything. He knows everyone and refers me to folks who are excellent. He has gently recommeded I see a different doctor for a problem than the one I was seeing. He is very tech savy and uses technology extremely well. He has just the greatest personality and bedside manner. He has given me lots of time when I needed it and got me in and out when I wanted it and it was okay medically. He has never missed a thing. He found a old unique (cheap) drug for me for a special problem that works just great. I think he is the! or among the finest Doctors I have ever know."

I took it every night through 12/2014 (I called monthly, and he renewed the prescription). When I started having memory problems and he began treating me for ""early Alzheimer's"".
I researched Ambien, and learned that you're only supposed to take it for short periods, and long term use is linked to memory problems. I stopped taking it, and over the next 6 months or so the memory issues subsided. I've stopped seeing Dr. Zenner and gone back to my prior doctor.
I would hope that when a doctor prescribes a medication, he's aware of the potential side effects and manages doses and medication period."

In my humble opionion, Dr. Goldfarb and staff make every effort to engage, listen and help their patience. I had a PET scan, it was a Friday night, and Dr. Goldfarb took the time to call me to let me know it was negative. Thanfully. But Dr. Goldfarb took the extra effort, stayed in his office a few extra minutes to give me a little bit of peace of mind. I highly recommend Dr. Goldfarb and the Medical Clinic of Houston."

After a change in my employer insurance didn't have him on our plan, that didn't matter, I refused to go with one of the plans ""in-network"" doctors and stayed with Dr. Lu (no matter if I had to pay out of pocket).

He and his staff are great. He listens and boy does he provide feedback, so beware to add a little extra time for the open talks that can easily take 45 minutes.

Megan needs to be fired, she could care less if you lived or died. I think she is pregnant, she needs to be a "" Stay at Home Mom""! Toni has left, which was a real loss for Dr. Esantsi patients. I wanted to ask but they probably wouldn't have told me the truth. I don't know about Anna yet. I have gone to Dr. Esantsi for about 7 years. I had to go to Kelsey Seybold for a while and then went back to Dr. Esantsi. I don't know if he would know my name if he saw me at the mall. The staff does not call you back or call you with test results. You have to wait about 2 weeks, when you get them in the mail. Then you can't understand Doctor Esantsi's hand-writing.

He actually cares for his patients and listens to their concerns he includes them in the decision of his results. I would recommend Dr. Esantsi to all my friends, family and co-workers.

El Doctor solo se preocupa del seguro medico por lo que se nego a ordenarme unos examenes sabiendo que tengo un alto riesgo de ataque al corazon!."

When I called the office Mohammed told me that Aetna lies to get people to sign up with them. When I called Aetna they got Mohammed on the phone and faxed over proof that they had in fact paid them. Since I never saw the doctor only the PA I have no idea how good she is. Her staff needs to learn what it means for a practice to sign up as an in-network provider. It would also be helpful if they didn't trash insurance companies to the patients. I would not recommend this practice for medical care and billing.

She was very difficult to understand and spoke to us as though we were wasting her time. After she left, we had to ask the nurses to explain what was going on. She NEVER came to see the patient in the hospital room, and took FOUR hours to allow him to be discharged - never came into the room, threw a fit in the hallway with the nurses about how hard it was for her to do her job. Her PA came in once, told the patient he would have to undergo all kinds of tests that were not required, further stressing him, after his cardiologist had already said he wouldn't need any additional tests. Her office staff is very rude, left me on hold for 10 minutes and longer each time I called for more information about the bill. The accounts manager hung up on me and I never was able to speak to the office manager."

He cauterized my nose but did it too far back where numbing medicine was not used causing extreme pain. I'm fairly certain that he fractured my nose in the process of digging around with his tools because I heard a loud crack. I left but was in so much pain that I had to go back and I was waiting for over half an hour in excruciating pain while I could overhear him having a casual friendly chat with some nurses. Will not be going back.

But I am giving full marks for Dr. Chater not treating me. I went to see him about my snoring problem. He was great at giving several options and very clear with what the results may or may not be. His honesty was refreshing and I felt he took my problems to heart. Some doctors I've seen, push there own agenda and professional needs. Dr. Chater helped me find what fits with me. In the end it was some minor lifestyle changes. No surgery or medical treatments. If, however, they are ever needed in his field, he'll be the first I go to see.
Thanks doc.... My wife thanks you too"

I needed to see an ENT for my sinus problems. Not only did Dr Chater seem very interested to really understand my symptoms he also did a great job explaining his findings to me. Since following his advice I have improved tremendously. He really is a caring doctor and if you suffer from sinus troubles you should go see him.

He was late for my appointment, which was the very first appointment slot of the morning. He was very rough with what should have been a routine exam and procedure. While suturing, he literally pulled me with him as he reached for something on the nearby table. He had a terrible bed-side manner, and would interrupt as I was asking questions. He also didn't provide me with enough information regarding my procedure, potential complications, healing process and time, signs of infection, etc., then was unavailable for follow-up contact at the number provided."

Sollene found my husbands cancer several months before he even had symptoms.

When I had a serious medical issue he directly admitted me to Methodist Hospital after he made some phone calls and got me taken care of. He is very knowledgeable (probably one of the most knowledgeable I have been around) and takes time to answer your all your questions and always add in """"What did I leave out?/What am I missing?"". He is now available 24/7 for emergency cases from his cell (which my family has used). Over the years he has diagnosed some of my family members have had ailments that others missed. He really is a great resource. His staff is also pretty reliable as well. I would add his recommendations for others doctors are also pretty good as well."

One of the most important things to me was that he listened to me. My mother's family had a history of heart attacks at an early age. My mother had her first heart attack when she was 50 years old (this was before bypass surgery). She died of a heart attack at 57. Anyway, every doctor I talked to about my family history did not seem concerned - my cholesterol was within the acceptable range. Dr. Sollenne ordered a stress test that showed several anomalies so then he ordered a stress test with imagining. We did that every year after that. A few years later he sent me to a cardiologist. The cardiologist did an angiogram. He said that I had the circulatory system of a 70 year old man! Well, I am 69 now and going strong."

He is not knowledgeable, thorough, nor persistant.He does NOT take action. He wants to wait it out and see what happens. He overlooked A LOT of signs for problems that should have been attended to immediately, but instead, he put it off for days and he almost cost a life."

Patients are people too, not just a lab report. It's my opinion that you: 1) must engage in conversation for quality patient care, not just stroll through the dialysis center, like it's your kingdom; 2)must listen to you patients and address their concerns.

He is an excellent doctor and very knowledgeable. The only complain I really have is his nurse Terry. She always seemed annoyed on the phone and in person. helpful but I feel like I always feel like I have to ask her a favor to do her job. Phone calls always goes to her voicemail and sometimes she will not return calls and when she does shes is very snooty.

Dr. Paulsel has been my primary physician for over 30 years. I saw a television segment involving a patient, his involvement with doctor's and nurse's, dealing with his emergency appendectomy and his praise for them. My procedure was an appendectomy. My wife called late one evening and left a message with the answering service. Within minutes he called back and said to my wife ""he never calls, what is the matter"". She explained my symptoms and he told my wife to get me to emergency room asap. She did and he met me at the ER. During the various stages of my admittance and subsequent stay, if there was a question put to me concerning my doctor, I responded with his name and all of them responded that they had the highest regard for his professionalism, bed side manner, etc. His staff goes above and beyond, has always responded and accepted any of my referral's. I apologize for taking so long to write this. It is extremely important to compliment and easy to complain! If I can be more specific or add to my list of complements, let me know. S.

I've had so many other MDs rush through this process but with Dr. Paulsel I leave with confidence that I really am healthy and nothing was glossed over.

Since she has joined Memorial Herrmann Medical Group it has all been downhill. The staff is unprofessional and uncaring of patient's time and today Dr. Gandhi herself proved that to be the case as well. I have spoken to her about all this on previous occasions but it has not gotten any better. You cannot be a top-rated physician with a total lack of control over the staff. Joining a group was one of the worst decisions Dr. Gandhi could have made for her practice if she truly cares about her patients.

She has been exemplary in compassionate patient care. When I was going through a very difficult health problem, she provided tremendous support for me and my family. She even gave us her home number to call any time if my health situation warranted it. She has exemplary bed-side manners, and she spends plenty of time for every appointment, never in a rush to finish and move on to the next patient. Because she is so good with patients, she is always busy and often wait time can be as much as half an hour. But I would not mind waiting even more for a doctor like her. Her staff, often lets her down, because she is a solo practice, it is harder to find good staff. But she more than makes up for her staff's shortcomings.

When I met Dr. Batchu for the first time and expressed my desire that I am tired of medication and feeling weak, she spent a lot of time understanding my profession, lifestyles, and habits and ordered a comprehensive tests to look at my body condition. She then worked with me through an awesome nutritional plan wherein slowly I stopped all the bad foods I used to eat and started eating very good food and she also helped me through guiding through yoga plans that she practices. Within a few months I became more active and stronger, physically and mentally and had never needed medication since."

Dr. Batchu explains everything in detail and is ready to answer any question. Dr. Batchu has been managing my GERD through diet and exercise and weaned me off PPIs. I do not take PPIs anymore. SHe helped me with guidance on weight reduction and since following her advice, I have reduced 25 pounds and also feel a lot better. I would strongly recommend her for your primary care needs."

No people skills. She appears to want to get you out of hospital asap since she is a Medicare physician. Hurry up & get out appears to be her motto or puting patients on anti-psycotic drugs....

He is genuinely caring, researches and works with other specialists to make good decisions. He contemplates side effects and other medical history. He is friendly, listens, and takes his time to work in your best interest. He calls me at home if he feels he needs to rather than leaving it someone else. His support staff is generally good, but May is outstanding. She is a gift to his practice, caring, remembers and takes us seriously. The only problem is we have to wait for a long time before seeing him - the process is usually around two hours which is difficult if you have children. Yet, after discovering him, I could not imagine trusting my health or that of my family with anyone else. What a gift to the medical practice in Southwest Houston."

Our family feels that Dr Zaheer is not a doctor that provides quality care. His claim to fame is that he WAS a clinical instructor at Baylor. His website and business cards stated that he was currently an instructor at Baylor but he hadnt been with Baylor since she 1999 which was over 10 years ago and was only with Baylor for one year. I would not send anyone I loved to Dr Amer Zaheer in Houston.

I did my homework during my initial search for a new physician interested in preventative medicine. I made an appointment with ease and had no waiting time. He was extremely thorough with the examination and follow up testing. I had warning signs and a bad family gene pool. He put me on a regime of preventative medications that would save my life within the year. Specialists treating me after the event all wanted to know who prescribed the medications that I was on then credited Dr. Zaheer with negating any permanent limiting damage. Dr. Zaheer continues to follow my progress today and will always be my doctor. I have recommended him to all my friends. He is the simply the best!!
360,Dr. Amer Zaheer,Houston,Texas,Internist / Geriatrician, Male,4,4.19,2009-07-09T15:54:21Z,5,5,5,5,5,Lovely Doctor. My mother works at Park Plaza and referred him. Very patient and knowledgeable. Great patient manners.

And he was accurate in dealing with each situation. He sincerely cares about his patients and their overall well-being. He spends adequate time with patients, and never rushes or loses focus on your concerns. I live in Austin, and travel back to Houston when I need medical attention. I highly esteem him as a person, and as a Doctor."

I always feel better leaving, but the wait time is absolutely ridiculous. On average I spend at least 30-45 minutes in the front waiting room and then another 30-45 minutes in the patient room. It's bad enough that I am looking for a new doctor."

Normally i can get in with in the same day, the wait depends on who you see some are faster than others. The only thing i dont really like is the turn around on the staff it seams like latley everytime you go in there is a new face, and the girls in the front dont always know what they are doing."

The condescending behavior of Dr Pezzia's wife, Tricia, is outrageous. She is rude and hateful. All she cares about is money. I was trying to make an appointment for my child who was ill a couple of weeks ago and she refused treatment for my daughter because of a bill for my other child's account that I wasn't EVEN AWARE OF. I would have paid the balance to take care of it but I decided to take my daughter to another doctor that was a little less concerned about a measly $40.00 balance. My daughter sees Amy Frank and we will miss her but I am taking my entire family elsewhere. I will not allow this woman to belittle me or anyone of my family or friends. And yes, I will be informing all of my referrals to go elsewhere! GOOD RIDDENS!!!"

In this 20 years, his office has moved 2-3 times and I have followed him wherever he goes and will continue to do so. I am also a heart patient and Dr. Pezzia is very knowledgeable about my heart disease and takes care of all my meds so that I do not have to see my cardiologist as often. My cardiologiat totally trusts him with this, as do I! My entire family goes to Dr. Pezzia. My daughter is too young to see him right now so she sees Amy or Renee, his physician assistants. They are SO good with her and she loves them! Not only is Dr. Pezzia an amazing doctor that I trust with my life, his staff will bend over backwards to help me and my family with anything we need. I truly feel like they are a part of our family! I have referred many people to Dr. Pezzia and they have all been pleased as well!"

He makes inappropriate comments, does not know what he is talking about, and does not seem to really give two craps about his patients or what he is supposed to be doing for a living. My mother had a severe allergic reaction to a z pack he gave her and when she went back a week later he said it would have been fully out of her system by then. Incorrect. She went to a dermatologist that knew more than this ""doctor."" He has made multiple inappropriate comments to my mother at his clear lack of a social and love life and its sad and pathetic. Be professional and do your job if you are even capable to do so."

His reservation policy is efficient in that he only takes reservations one day in advance so you can actually get in to see him when you need to. Definitely recommend as a PCP."

418,Dr. Tejpal S. Grover,Houston,Texas,Internist / Geriatrician, Male,4,4.06,2013-01-23T23:58:09Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Grover and his team were great! He is very funny and never makes you feel rushed or like ""a number""! You immediately feel comfortable with him. One thing that I really liked about this practice was that they have half pediatrics and half adult medicine, so I can knock my appointments out with my kids' appointments and they can ""graduate"" to an adult doctor while still seeing the same familiar faces! It is a wonderful practice and I would recommend to anyone!"

I can honestly say that Dr. Grover is the best doctor I've ever had. He is kind, knowledgeable, and always ready to explain things. His only possible fault is that the appointments can take a while because he will spend so much time talking with you and reviewing your options. When I had an issue with my insurance company, his staff spent several hours over the course of a few weeks sorting it out for me. I cannot rate him highly enough."

I was asked to keep my children outside because they did not want them to open and close the door, because the a/c was on! My children opened and closed the door to the office twice, to go to the car to get their HOMEWORK! I have never received such treatment in a dr's office before!! My father's appointment was for 4:00p.m. and he wasn't seen until 5:00p.m. I guess they expected the children to wait for 1 1/2 hour and NOT MOVE!! I was mortified at the treatment I received!!!!"

The one thing that he doesn't do is follow up with his patients. I should have gotten a call from his office that once I see him and get my blood work done that he would want me back in his office to review the results of my blood work. Its not like he is too busy to have one of his staff to give me a call to set up appointment. I have had better doctors especially in Michigan where I am from before I moved down here to Texas.

Her office visit is very high about $400 and she does not take any insurance. I had the impression that she was only interested in selling her supplements and detox equipments and recommending expensive tests without even seeing my son. They recommended not to bring the child in order not to interupt the visit! She even refused to refill my prescription for B12 injections until I paid $250 phone consult. I do not recommend this Doctor. She is only after your money.

She is thorough and very caring. She asks many questions and takes the most complete history of any Dr. I've seen (and believe me it's been many!). She's expensive, but well worth it. She's helped tremendously leveling my hormones and I've lost more weight on her system than any other I've tried. I highly recommend Dr. Pearsall and the Longevity Center of Houston."

Seemed obsessed with money above care. Pushed her retail skin care products and supplements heavily. Also too quick to diagnose and prescribe new meds based on marginal test results. Subsequent doctor reversed diagnoses and dropped me from five meds to one.

He's one of the top authorities on pediatric ENT in Texas, and the medical school he attended abroad is the best in the country. Disregard the thinly veiled racism shown by the previous reviewer."

Doesn't seem to know a lot about ENT, I should've question his diploma, because it's from another country not from an US college."

A glance at typical patient in waiting room should have been my 1st clue to run. Hacking, talking to themselves, moaning and, in general, carrying on like the trailer trash they appear. Was told Joe was running on time but this was a lie. No matter how competent this doc is, I will NEVER return to someone who has so little regard for my time."

Galati,Houston,Texas,Internist / Geriatrician, Male,12,3.25,2014-02-23T11:29:54Z,1.3,1,2,1,1,Was treated by Dr. Galati and Lauren Thomas for my hep c genotype 1A they screwed up my treatment and caused me to relapse. Now i have to go through treatment again. I thought I was going to one of the best. Be aware and make sure that you as the pt discuss your medical history yourself every visit. Don't count on them! Very disappointed! Would not recommend.

The first Dr. we saw painted a bleak picture so we decided to go for a 2nd opinion and Dr. Galati provided assurance that he could help me and he did. I have GenoType 1-A the hardest to cure, and although I'm not cured, my liver is healed to almost normal after treatments. I'll continue to see him as I trust him to give me the BEST possible care. He's an excellent doctor."

I have a late case of hepatitis c and he was the first to explain this to me (after seeing specialists all over the area). He was calm and cool with me, and made me fell 100 percent better after explaining it all to me. He is a great guy who spends all the time needed with you. He is not your typical doctor. Highly recommend."

I learned more in that hour than I had after seeing 2 other doctors I had seen for the same problem over 3 years. He is a kind and warm man. Loren, his nurse is a saint. The office can be e-mailed and they respond to questions fast. The best. Bless him."

However, on one occasion, he prescibed me a medication which sent my blood sugar soaring (I'm type 2 diabetic with a usual fasting glucose of 130-150. After taking the medication he prescribed, it shot to 400. When I called him for a followup consultaion, he had no time for me and send me to the Emergency Room, where they did nothing, and it cost me $500. He could have done a LOT better on this one!"

He is always so friendly and has a very good personality. He is an expert in drugs and compatibility. I take other drugs for an emotional disorder that I have had since my teens. I tell him everything I take and a few times there was a problem. One time he spoke to my other doctor immediately because of compatibility problems. I went into the hospital for the first time this year....he really took care of me and explained many of the procedures. If you want an excellent interest....this is your doctor. Robert Bowers

457,Dr. Sanila Rana,Houston,Texas,Internist / Geriatrician, Female,8,4.47,2007-02-05T09:18:51Z,2,,3,1,2,"She was rushed and would not take the time to fully answer my questions. I asked her about the sensitivity of a particular diagnostic test and rather than reply that she didn't know, she became defensive. Also, her staff violated my privacy and confidentiality, and one staff person in particular yelled out to her something about me as she was walking down the hall (there were other patients in the vicinty who heard the personal piece of information). Furthermore, I suspect that she tries to push people to get unnecessary tests and procedures like X-rays simply because they have an X-ray machine in the office as well as a blood lab, and can stand to make money off it. I felt that she was a little condescending. Thank you for this opportunity to rate this doctor."

This is due to his lack of listening to the patient, his attitude that comes somewhat arrogant. I am sure he is knowledgeable in his field; but knowledge does not go very far if he is not empathic with his patient. My spouse has now seen Dr. Dickinson and is in total agreement with my opinion. We will be looking for another Internal Medicine doctor in the Houston area."

I am a middle aged patient with no particular medical issues. My visit was simply for a check up. He spent his time trying to impress me with 'his experience and vocabulary'; what he will do and will not do! I researched him on the Kelsey Seybold website so I could read his bio - when he walked into the examine room I nearly fell over! His bio pic on the Kelsey web site must be from 20 years ago- he is an older gentleman with a nice sprayed comb over. I am still looking for a caring Internal Medicine doc that wants to listen to me and give me guidance.

In my opinion, I rated Dr. Tambra with the highest tabs which are most fitting,in his case,from my hospital stay experience at The Methodist. It was apparent that Dr. Tambra possessed a wealth of knowledge in his field of expertise via his observations, preceps, and examples relevant in my health care situation. He shared both research-based and current newfound information that established a better understanding of my health dilemma which prompted me in making more sound and educated decisions.

473,Dr. HEMA C. Patel,Houston,Texas,Internist / Geriatrician, Female,4,4,2008-10-31T11:18:31Z,1.3,1,1,1,2,"Had an appt for 1045, there was no sign in sheet & nobody present behind window. I waited about 45 still with no acknowledment. When I finally did see someone at the window, I asked about how much longer I would have to wait, she answered rudely, ""I don't know."" As I sat waiting, the receptionist spoke about me to the Dr. and said that I had only been out there for only 10 minutes. When I finally did met with Dr. Patel, 20 minutes later, she explained that her first appts of the morning were 45 minutes late. I told her that I did not mind waiting, but at least some information about how long and without the rudeness, since I would have rescheduled had I known that I would have to spend more time off work. After more research about VA guidelines on va.gov, I realized that she did not follow correct procedures outlined by the VA when providing compensation assessments."
474,Dr. Joshua Michael Gold,Houston,Texas,Internist / Geriatrician, Male,8,3.67,2013-06-21T09:15:40Z,4,4,4,4,4,"Dr. Gold has been my physician for almost two years now. He has always been very diligent and thorough to my needs/requests. Every time there has been an issue or concern, both he and his staff have been able to give me sound guidance, and practical alternatives if needed. On more than one occasion, Dr. Gold has gone above the expected level of service, and has shown that he truly cares about me as his patient. He'll only want to administer the best treatments he sees possible, which can get pricey (fast), but if that is an issue, he'll work with you to find another way, because he genuinely wants to see you get the treatment you need. He has a useful wealth of knowledge, and a decent sense of humor too. I'd recommend him!"
475,Dr. Joshua Michael Gold,Houston,Texas,Internist / Geriatrician, Male,8,3.67,2012-10-04T10:42:13Z,2.3,1,2,3,3,"When I called in to get an appointment, Dr. Gold's wife/secretary was eager to get me in the next day, which was a nice surprise. The office itself is outdated and the equipment looks ancient, so I was fairly trepidatious about my visit (allergies). He did a very thorough exam, answered all my questions, and then we had a long session in his office about my care. Overall, I was very pleased with his bedside manner. Fast forward 18 months, and I called to get a refill on my allergy medication. Barbara answered, and I was reprimanded (!) on the phone for not having come in for a follow-up appointment. She said in a very accusatory tone that I ""must"" be seeing another doctor, and that according to their office ""policies"", I'm no longer considered an active patient. Then she hung up the phone on me. I could scarcely believe how unprofessional and rude she was. Well, I'm definitely going to be an ""active"" patient somewhere else then. I will not be back, under any conditions."

I have never known a doctor that was proficient as he is before or since seeing him. My praises of Dr. Gold could fill volumes of his benevolence. I sadly miss him since moving to Galveston. He truly is the best in Houston. Jonathan"

After two years of inconclusive results elsewhere, after I saw Dr. Gold he had me in two operating rooms and resolved major health issues that had caused years of pain and suffering. He very literally changed my life, and still tends to his patients very much like a caring mentor--calling on personal time, even, to make sure every aspect of my health is on his radar. I have recommended him also, and everyone who visits him passes his name onto someone else. Truly one of the greatest in the profession."

Dr. Niefield has helped me successfully manage my long term issues with cholesterol, triglycerides and blood pressure. I have found him to be a capable, compassionate doctor who has the knowledge and experience I need. He is particularly up to speed on men's health issues. When I asked him to visit my elderly father when he was in the hospital, he did so and helped me understand the medical issues in that situation. I have recommended him to several friends, all of whom now consider him their regular physician."

This occurred to me when I called him regarding my husband, who had just gotten out of the hospital and he was hateful and treated me with no respect because I should NOT call him after hours and that I should only call him during normal office hours! I am-was-a patient of his also. No patient or patients family members should ever be treated in such a manner. Doctors are human-they are NOT GOD-Not BETTER THAN EVERY OTHER PERSON. The only thing I can hope for is that HE IS TREATED ONE DAY JUST LIKE I WAS TREATED BY HIS HOLIER THAN ANY ONE ELSE JACK***!!! I am being extremely polite for a person who was just screamed at and demeaned by this physician. I will be reporting his behavior to his bosses and the Texas Medical Board."

I never feel rushed, he takes all the time necessary to listen to my complaint/concerns/questions, and he is very thorough. I am pleased that he interviews me carefully before diagnosing the problem. He likes to try inexpensive, non-invasive treatments before escalating to more drastic and costly methods. He calls evenings or weekends to personally deliver lab results if he can't reach me during normal working hours. The office is well-managed and has a great system for moving patients through the facility (doctor, x-ray, lab, EKG etc.), plus you leave with a print-out of everything discussed during your visit. They also have an online patient portal so you can review the details of lab results after the doc had discussed them with you. His medical staff also is very attentive and competent."

It is hard to make an appointment, especially on a short notice (when you need it the most). The staff are rude and unhelpful, they do not return calls, they 'forget' to call your pharmacy, and they are very slow at handling referrals to other doctors. Dr. Lisse himself is knowledgeable but his judgement is bad. One year Iost 50 pounds between annual checkups and he didn't even notice. I once received a referral from him to a surgeon that made a wrong diagnosis that could have caused me paralysis or extreme pain. Dr. Lisse was pretty upset that I got a second opinion and had surgery with another Dr. The last straw was this year. Dr. Lisse's nurse referred me to a Dr. that was out of my network. I had to pay for the service out of pocket. When I asked Dr. Lisse's office for a letter stating these facts, they refused and stopped returning my calls. I would strongly caution anyone against going to this Dr."

She made our profound loss easier by her dedication to providing all medical assistance that was possible until ultimately and sadly, the hospice she is Director of in the hospital and staffed by Vitas, was her recommendation. Vitas provided my Dad compassionate excellent care and we are so grateful he was able to be transferred there for his remaining 5 days. Thank you Dr Jarrell and Vitas Hospice."

She is a very sweet, caring Christian young lady. Great listening skills, willing to spend a longer period with patient if needed.

I previously had problems finding a doctor that would actually listen to my concerns and attempt to solve my problems. I like her so much I recommend her to anyone that I know, and have never heard any negative feedback. Her office staff did change this year so if you've had a problem with the staff (and not the doctor), I strongly recommend that you revisit her. Her current office staff is extremely helpful, polite, and professional. You may have to wait a little past your appointment time, but how many doctors have you seen that are on time? Because she can only estimate how much time a visit will take, she may be behind schedule. Also, I've called in with emergencies (due to pain) and her staff fit me in that day even though she didn't have any openings."

I had to reschedule because of the fasting I couldn't wait anymore. The next day I was 7 minutes late due to a mix up at the check in desk, fasting AGAIN, and first patient of the day, I was accepted into the patient room, and Dr. Williams came in and hostilely lectured me saying I was 7 minutes late and I was going to make all her patients late said sorry I'd have to reschedule. Recently I met someone who also saw her, intimidated by all the patients questions Dr. Williams called her a hypocondriac and banned her from the clinic entirely! I've gone to that clinic for 10+ years and saw another doctor prior that went conciegere thus my regretful switching and choosing Dr. Williams. The doctors code of ethics says something about patients needs being paramount to their own, well she's not got that one down in my view.

She was very caring and comforting when my mother died. I changed to heras my primary care physician shortly thereafter and I trusted her knowledge and judgment without reservation. Unfortunately we had a misunderstanding develop between us when she changed offices and her fax number changed. It caused a problem with getting a prescription refilled. I blamed her office staff and she blamed my pharmacy. Actually, it wasn't either one's fault. The faxes had been going to an office upstairs from her office and they did not send them to her. When I found out what the problem was, I texted her with an explanation. However, a few weeks later she sent me a letter dismissing me from her practice."

She has the kindest tone and is reminiscent of a caring mother who is committed to seeing her children get better. I drive a good distance to visit her and will not trade her for any other doctor in the world. There is not doubt in me concerning her training and medical ability. I had seen several doctors prior to Dr. Williams and on my first visit I was satisfied. She is my personal care physician and I am thankful to be listed as one of her patients.

I freely admit that if I am ill he will get me into the office. However as he gets older, he does not listen to what you are telling him. Says he will do something and then never follows through.

Center on Labor Day weekend of 2009. On that Saturday my father's appendix ruptured. Despite many calls and pages to him, he refused to do anything to see what was wrong. After three days of the poison coming from his appendix, he finally -- at my request -- sent a nephrologist to come check him because his kidneys had shut down. HE would not even come himself even though he was on call. The nephro doc took one look at my dad's stomach and said WHY IS THIS SO DISTENDED??? Had Dr. Muntz taken more then three minutes to check on him at 5:00 a.m. on the days he was there, maybe he would have caught the issue. This started a chain of events that led to a 12-month hospital stay for my father and finally his death. On the Monday of Labor Day weekend of '09, they had to do emergency surgery to remove the appendix but it was too late because the damage was done. His lack of care led to the death of my father."

When my original Internist retired, I immediately sought him out to become my Dr. He lives an exemplary healthy life himself and he has a very polished, direct practice of getting to exactly what is going on. However, he is available to talk things out if necessary. If you become ill and need to see him immediately, his staff will work you in on the day you call if at all possible. I find him to be extremely professional and knowlegeable and recommend him highly."

I was diagnosed with high blood pressure by another docotr and I was put on a horrible medication that was affecting my kidneys. Dr. Spencer immediately switched me to a much milder drug and she has been nothing but helpful and receptive to many of my health concerns.

Did not prescribe rxs needed for maintenance until I called later realizing they were not at the pharmacy. Referred me to specialist instead of giving me any reasonable treatment that he could have and that was desperately needed. So very disappointed.

He does not spend a good amount of time with his patients. In and out type of doctor. He is also is quick with giving strong prescriptions and unnecessary quantities of it. He does not give proper examinations and does not seem to care about the symptoms you tell him that you have. He ignores the patient and does not seem to care what is ailing them. He does not even ask questions about what you may have. He does not seem to know what he is doing and does not seem to care about the patient's health and well-being. He also seems to look down on his patients. His office staff is not friendly either.

He is not quick to refer to a specialist and is quick to prescribe uneeded medication without proper diagnosis. I was and still am expercing daily headaches for the past year and it took him 1 month to order a MRI and that was only after I insisted. And yes he is too conservative and is not a good listner at all.

Not as punctual as some might like, but that's because he takes his time with his patients and doesn't try to rush them through. A good listener. Very knowledgeable, and great at referring you to specialists. Probably not to everyone's taste, because he's conservative in his analysis and not prone to order up a bunch of tests immediately. I happen to like that attitude, because some physicians can scare you out of your wits based on little evidence or analysis of your case."

He did not stress the seriousness of my possible condition. I put things off. He was very agreeable rather than assertive. He will prescribe pretty much whatever (can't blame doctors too much for that b/c we've trained them to give us the prescriptions we want). However, my appendicitis went undiagnosed for 8 months. I had warning signs in my blood work, in my symptoms and in the descriptions I gave him. I needed a cat scan, but put it off b/c of the cost. He reassured me that if I felt ok, I was ok. I was on antibiotics which hid the infection. I wound up hospitalized for 2 weeks after my gyno found the infection in the appendix. So much for the internist. He is a nice guy and felt bad about it later and he did follow up with me in the hospital. Appendicitis is actually very difficult to diagnos, but I felt there were adequate warnings."

Recognizes and treats according to severity of cases. Not always punctual, but this is because he spends whatever time is required with each patient, unlike other doctors who schedule patients every 10 minutes and then rush patients through without proper diagnosis. Treats in a very conservative manner, choosing to do no harm rather than just prescribe antibiotics and pain killers for every condition. Very helpful in recommending and facilitating appointments with specialists when conditions warrant. Always treats me in a very professional manner. Specializes in treating old people, especially cranky ones like me."

While she is not rude, I agree that she is totally lacking in any personable skills, cold and distant, and does not instill trust. The doctor I could not comment on other than, I just started seeing her and am already wondering why on earth the person who referred me to her thinks that this office is so 'wonderful'"

Our doctors retired and Dr. Khatri replaced out internist. She only took patients who were not on Medicare and when I reached age 65 she dumped me. I had an emergency and she told me to call Medicare and ask them to mail me a list of internists that took Medicare. I asked her why she took me as a patient for four years and she said because I was not on Medicare those four years and although I was close to Medicare age she had no patients and was just new in practice . The Medical Clinic of Houston has built a big expensive building next door to their old clinic on Sunset and they do not want Medicare patients. For Khatri and the crowd at the Medical Clinic of Houston it is now all about money, not about practicing medicine.

She missed one appointment, called in while I was waiting to say she was home. Other appointment she seemed interested in my somewhat complex med history but in the end said I was fine, go home and enjoy life. I've had several biopsies, lymph nodes removed, along with a list of other things, that she had no explanation for or was dismissive, saying it was more or less normal because my blood tests were normal now, which they weren't at one time. Also recommended I take a medication another doctor had taken me off of and I also don't want to take. I don't expect one doctor to know everything but thought by going to Baylor, they would refer me to another department until I got a dx."

However, both times that I have come to her with problems, she has been dismissive and condescending. For instance, she dx'd my bladder pain (from a UTI) as ""muscle pain"", even after the UA came back positive for bacteria. She dx'd recurrent headaches accompanied by nausea as stress-related, even though I told her that I wasn't under an unusual amount of stress, and that I'd never had headaches before. I saw a neurologist a week later who dx'd me with migraines, and started me on medication, which helped tremendously. The ""seasonal allergies"" she said I had were actually a chronic sinus infection caused by acid reflux. Dr. Wang was highly recommended to me by another doc, so I gave her a few tries before coming to this conclusion. Bottom line--go elsewhere if you want to be taken seriously."

On my wife's follow-up visit he referred to his notes to carefully assess the effectiveness of the treatment he prescribed. I found it especially satisfying how he read her face, body language and her ability to grip in order to record accurate scores to the best of his ability. He very well spoken, listens carefully, answers all of our questions. It is clear I could not have found a better doctor.
You will see most if not all people give him a 5 out of 5 on every aspect of him, his care, effectiveness, compassion, staff. Last week was my wife's second visit to him and the followup was meticulously executed to accurately assess and in great detail how the medication is working.
I am telling you that we are rating him 5 out of 5 but it is simply the truth. How rare it is to feel that way about anything.

I wanted to like her, but I found her to be very unfriendly and at times almost hostile. When she came into the room she always managed to make me feel like I was an inconvenience and that I had interrupted something more important. Her bedside manner was non existent."

He is Certified by American Board of Surgeons, by American College of Surgeons and by Bariatric Center of Excellence 2. Dr. is experienced and dedicated to weight loss surgery. 3. Personalized Weight Loss Consultation 4. Dr. doesn't have residence in his practice. He personally comes to visit you at the hospital on following morning/day after the surgery. 5. Success story from real patients 6. He answers phone calls from his patients 24/7"
598,Dr. Felix Spiegel,Houston,Texas,Internist / Geriatrician, Male,20,2.63,2013-09-10T09:57:28Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Everyone has their own issues and as Dr. Spiegel told me: IF you feel confident you will succeed. The lapband is simply a tool that you have to use. His office staff and himself were very informative, encouraging, and patient. I had my surgery in April of 2005. I lost 50+ pounds in the first year and was very disappointed that it was not more. After speaking with him & his staff I realized I am a depression eater & ice cream slides down past that band without any problem, so does salad IF you soak it in enough dressing. I have learned to ""use"" the tool I purchased from him. I have lost over 130 pounds & kept it off. I have even had my second child (very healthy) with the lapband even though he told me it was not advisable without releasing the fluid. Dr. Spiegel holds nothing back when you see him. You either want to use the tool or you don't, he can't make magic happen, he is only a doctor. As for as the initial surgery - it was awesome, great hospital care and attention."

I was given barium to see what was going on. I have no idea if Dr Spiegel ever looked at those xrays. I was never told anything was wrong...however, something inside made me apprehensive and after being told how much out of pocket I would have to pay because the attending physician wasn't even in my insurance (BlueCross) network, I sought Dr Robert Davis. That was the best thing I could have ever done. When I swallowed the barium for the X-ray, he was right there and found that my staple line was ripped and I had an almost complete obstruction explaining where all of my pain was coming from!!! He then brought me back to a room, SAT DOWN and discussed my options with me!!! I, not once, was told about any of this from Dr Spiegel's office!!! Always trust your inner voice!!! The Davis Clinic Houston Texas...check them out...it could save your life!!!!"
601,Dr. Felix Spiegel,Houston,Texas,Internist / Geriatrician, Male,20,2.63,2012-05-08T00:29:26Z,1.5,1,3,1,1,In 2001 this idiot put a way to small band on my husband next year he put a larger band.He had nothing but trouble he never gave proper education before or after. Nice gals in the Port Neches office then he brought his Houston team in and closed down leaving everyone in a lurch. His idea of checking the saline in your band is fill it up tight so you can barely drink water. Having moved to Dallas Texas where there are doctors who know what they are doing instead of money grabbing like Spiegel does we found out he had put the band in wrong. We were told we were lucky my husbands stomach didnt start to die off. If you feel like living on the side of danger run to your phone and book with this quack.
602,Dr. Felix Spiegel,Houston,Texas,Internist / Geriatrician, Male,20,2.63,2012-03-14T18:18:57Z,1.3,1,1,1,2,"I had my lap-band surgery in December 2003 with Dr. Spiegel at Mid-Jefferson Hospital. I really liked Dr. Spiegel and his staff until AFTER my surgery was complete. I was not experiencing any restriction with my band so I returned MANY times very soon after my surgery for repeated fills.  I also was not losing much weight. Every time I voiced my concern I was told that I HAD to be doing something wrong. I MUST have been drinking alot of fruit juice or milkshakes. This was NOT the case! My lap-band never worked properly from the very beginning and now I am seeking help from another doctor for a revision to the gastric sleeve. Also,it is IMPOSSIBLE to get Dr. Spiegel's office to release your medical records to you. I had a barium swallow performed by another surgeon in August of 2010 and that surgeon told me that the band had been placed too high on the stomach to even create a pouch. It was sitting at the base of my esophagus. I do NOT recommend using this surgeon."
603,Dr. Felix Spiegel,Houston,Texas,Internist / Geriatrician, Male,20,2.63,2012-02-03T21:38:09Z,1.8,1,3,1,2,"I went to Dr. Speigal 4 years ago to have a revision on a lap band done by a notorious surgeon back in the 80's. He was very arrogant, and over confident, and he told me he was the one to do this. He said worst scenario was that he would have to do a larger incision. He did absolutely no tests on my damaged stomach prior to surgery. I asked him if he had ever attempted surgery on anyone and. not been able to place a band, and he told me only once. Then his staff collected a lot of my money in cash, and in advance. His office was in an old house in Pt. neches and the hospital where my surgery was done was an old, out dated hospital that was briefly closed last year for not paying employees. On the day of surgery, Dr speigal asked me on the operating table that he didn't think he could do my surgery. I told the staff I didn't want to have the surgery if he felt this way and he changed his mind. When I came back to check my incision, he didn't even remember I didn't have a band. No!"
604,Dr. Felix Spiegel,Houston,Texas,Internist / Geriatrician, Male,20,2.63,2011-07-24T16:57:53Z,4.8,4,5,5,5,"I don't know where all these negative comments are coming from! Dr. Spiegel and his staff have answered every question and handled every issue EVERY STEP OF THE WAY from my consultation through approval and finally surgery. I just got home from my BPD/DS, hernia repair, and gall bladder removal, and I feel great. He came by and talked to me all three days I was in the hospital and was warm and pleasant. He answered every question I threw at him. I attribute feeling so good such a short time after a major surgery to the fact that he is a VERY GOOD SURGEON, which is exactly what I wanted. He also sells his nutritional supplements for about half of what you'll pay for them anywhere else (check QWLC to see what I mean). Ok, so he's busy and maybe he doesn't want to add a doc because he would rather take care of him personally. However, I wouldn't recommend anyone BUT him in Houston for the BPD/DS procedure."
605,Dr. Felix Spiegel,Houston,Texas,Internist / Geriatrician, Male,20,2.63,2011-07-19T13:23:33Z,2,1,1,2,4,I would not advise anyone to go to this doctor he has horrible bed side manner and doesnt explain anything to the patient. He is too expensive and needs help in sdvising the patients and being more friendly. Not worth the oney because he is expensive!!!
606,Dr. Felix Spiegel,Houston,Texas,Internist / Geriatrician, Male,20,2.63,2011-06-29T22:34:22Z,4,4,4,3,5,"If you're looking for a warm, fuzzy doctor and staff...you're in the wrong place. However, I had a gastric bypass in Nov. of 09 and have lost 106 lbs to date and kept it off. No negative side effects but I've done exactly as instructed. Dr. Speigel is very knowledgeable but I agree with the others that have said he should really think about investing a bit more time with his patients. The whole cash only policy is a bit odd as well."

If she had looked she would have noticed she gave a 90 year old woman hyperthyroidism from overdosing with thyroid medicine. Also had a 90 year old on anti anxiety meds while on them she asked her to take anti depressants. She over medicated and does not check lab work also bullies 90 year old females to have mammograms! What kind of treatment can you give a 90 year old! Why put a 90 year old through that. Do not see this so-called doctor. She is heartless.

She cares, and she follows through. She sent me for the test that revealed lung cancer in time for surgury to cut it out. She also helped when I was had a blood clot and followed through on the test that revealed I had too much warfarin in my system. I want her back at Kelsey!!!"

Didn't want my medical records or to acknowledge previous diagnosis of fibromyalgia, depression, and other. Refused me refills of long standing maintenance medication and made several nasty, personal insults. Never again will I tolerate abuse of this nature.

I have never before encountered such a dismissive and rude primary care MD. She clearly did not believe me when I told her how much discomfort I was experiencing (both with the UTI and the back spasms) and barely examined me when I came in for back pain. The next time Kelsey Seybold tries to schedule an appointment for me with her, I will insist on a different MD. Avoid, avoid, avoid."

Wherever she offices, I go there. When I had a health issue over 15 years ago, she immediately diagnosed the problem, AND gave me options on dealing with it.

She has an excellent bedside manner and knows the questions to ask to get her patients the adequate care they need. There is no other doctor my family trusts more than her.

I have never met the doctor only her NP. The facilities are somewhat old and dirty for being in the health system she is in. I would give higher rating IF either IF the following were true: 1) When I had my OBGYN exam by the NP it didn't hurt more than any other prior, felt personalized, wasn't given a pamphlet on weight loss at check out without any discussion on my weight, was told not to eat prior to appt b/c urine test needed to be on fasting, and was told labs were done somewhere else and I would need to make an appointment with the lab PRIOR to getting my medication OR 2) If when I call for anti-fungal cream or for other prescriptions that can easily be called in without a 100.00 office visit she would. Instead she say, she hasn't seen me in 6 months (well, I've never met her) and that she needs ""assess"" symptoms of red/round RINGWORM! Seems like she is in it for the money not to treat patients."

Was NOT given choice about seeing an Intern or not. Really NEVER received care from Dr Kundi at all, only his Interns that he trains.

Instead, I got a call from her nurse saying that Dr. Kirmani would need to see me in order to prescribe me. I asked if Dr. Kirmani can call me so I can tell her my symptoms as I am unable to drive to see her in my condition. Her nurse told me the doctor will not give me a call. This is unbelievable. It seems to me Dr. Kirmani cares more about making her money with my visit than making sure her patients are doing well - at least she could give me a call. Therefore, I am disappointed to say, I DO NOT recommend her as your general doctor."

I waited weeks for this appt. and received a automated confirmation call before my appt. I am disabled and elderly and hit the wrong button on the phone which cancelled my appt. (Could not see phone pad AND couldn't understand wht the mssg was). My blood pressure went up to almost 200 after the rude staff refused to honor my appt. I had to pay $4 to park for nothing. Also I walk with a cane and was in alot of pain. I ended up having to go to the ER for my blood pressure immediately after I left that office. Very rude staff and would not recommend this doctor.
642,Dr. Hari K. Susarla,Houston,Texas,Internist / Geriatrician, Male,7,3.04,2014-03-14T02:11:05Z,4.8,4,5,5,5,"Doctor Susarla was polite, clear in his explanations, and never made me feel rushed or forced into just one way of doing things. I like the fact that he didn't recommend unnecessary tests, but at the same time allowed me the option to pursue reasonable testing that I was interested in. I was also pleasantly surprised to discover that he was well regarded by the staff of the local hospital ER I had to visit, and also that he attends his own hospital patients when they are sick. If you are looking for a primary care doctor who will be there for you, you can't go wrong with this one. Highly recommended."

I've never had any problems. Waiting time is short, usually less than 10 minutes, and same-day/next-day appointments were always available. Doctor is friendly and explains things clearly, and seems to enjoy seeing kids (he sees both adults and kids and my husband has also seen him). I would highly recommend him."

Susarla,Houston,Texas,Internist / Geriatrician, Male,7,3.04,2011-12-24T14:15:31Z,3.5,4,4,3,3,"My husband saw Dr. Susarla when we relocated to the Houston area from another city as he wanted to establish a new doctor and continue his meds. Anyway, he WALKED into his office and was in a wheelchair on our last visit to him. He put him on Indocin, which caused some renal insufficiency and didn't even address the fact that he had an infection somewhere, as his white blood count was up.I took him home in a wheelchair and eventually had to call 911 to take him to the hospital because he was in pain, couldn't bear weight and couldn't get into the truck. Needless to say, we changed doctors in the hospital."

My first visit with him I scheduled an appointment for all 3 of my kids together. He flat out told me that he was overwhelmed by all the kids and that I'm not allowed to bring them all again. He left the room but did not close the door. I heard him tell a nurse that some people should just not have kids. He said there should be a limit of one child per woman. Who is he to say that? Why would you go into a profession with children if you are easily overwhelmed by them? I am never going their again.
647,Dr. Hari K. Susarla,Houston,Texas,Internist / Geriatrician, Male,7,3.04,2011-01-10T10:52:21Z,2,1,3,2,2,I am the mother of a former patient of Dr Susarla's. He was my child's pediatrician since birth. When he closed his practice in Missouri City and moved to his new practice I attempted to get my child's records transferred. As it turns out his new office was not able to produce my 2 year old child's shot records! There is no record of dates/signatures/etc... for shot records. The only one listed was his first two at birth and 6 weeks. Needless to say this has caused me great concern for my child's health (as I do not know what he has already been vacinated for) as well as a great deal of issues with his daycare and new pediatrician. Very upsetting!!! I made at least 6 attempts to get his records straightened away with Dr Susarla's new nurses and they printed some typically shot schedule off the internet and crossed out the vaccines they think he's gotten. No signatures/dates/etc.

For whatever reason, she decided to poke fun of my weight and continually laugh and sniggle constantly while making jeering remarks. This went on until the time I walked out of the office door. Yes, I admit I am struggling with a thyroid condition but my weight problems just did not pop overnight all these years. So why now? Due to the childish, unprofessional behavior, I decided to change doctors. Hopefully, I will deal with someone who acts mature and have just a little bit of class."

I want my physician to take his or her time and do the job effectively. If that means I have to sit in the waiting room then so be it. Dr. Lux never makes me feel rushed. I greatly appreciate his thoroughness.

Lux,Houston,Texas,Internist / Geriatrician, Male,3,3.67,2011-06-21T10:28:08Z,4.5,4,4,5,5,Any minor short comings on punctuality are more than compensated for by his willingness to spend extra time with the patient if needed. Dr Lux is very perceptive and very caring. His broad knowledge is informed in part by his experience in the UT medical system as a doctor and teacher. His current practice at the MCH allows him to provide excellent care and referrals.

Just a one trick pony infusion tech. Crazy weirdo. Whole atmosphere, environment and doctor was strange. Did no testing. Incapable of making any complicated infectious disease diagnosis requiring identity of source of infection and culturing/testing to identify it so that it can be treated with right antibiotic therapy. Caused serious delay in diagnosis and treatment of me but others affected since mine was communicable by ordinary hand-to-hand contact. Found his actions to constitute both fraud and malpractice"

He will offer a variety of treatment options to ensure the best results and is not afraid to use strong drugs if needed, but is not liberally passing out narcotics, he can tell if someone is just seeking drugs. He is by far the best doctor I have been to. He will spend enough time to ensure you understand your condition and treatment options and does not overbook like other physicians. I will continue to see him for all of my medical issues, he will consult with specialist to get their take on your condition. I would highly recommend him to all of my friends and family because he truly cares about your well being. His staff is very friendly and patient. I believe this doctor is # 1 and wants the best for all of his patients."

It took 3 weeks to get a response on something I needed desperately to treat a condition. Every time I called her office was rude, blew me off, and she never once called me with results even though she said she would in office. Now as a result of my condition and the lack of treatment from Dr. Wertz, I am now in severe pain. I gave the office 3 weeks!!!!! Where I was checking up nearly every day. I guess there is a reason urgent care is growing rapidly."

I was diagnosed with a compression fracture in two places in my back. I was prescribed a medication on 9-18-2012 to facilitate bone growth. It took 3 months for me to receive it (12-18-2012). In the intervening time I broke a rib. It should not take 3 months to get a prescription. [Every time] I called the pharmacy they were waiting on information from the doctor's office. The staff seems grossly incompetent. I have no way to know for sure if I could have avoided injury by getting the rx in a timely matter but it certainly would have helped my odds of avoiding the injury. I would never recommend using this dr. When I fear breaking a bone performing daily activities and the office staff can't be bothered to return a call to the pharmacy, return my calls, or fill out the needed forms it represents a clear lack of priority for my health. They also charged me and make me come into the office for test results."

The lab had to then fax my results to a different doctor who informed me there was nothing wrong with me and that the test results concluded I was normal and healthy. I was very grateful, but upset that I had waiting three weeks thinking I had diabetes and several other things wrong with me when I am 125lbs. It was very upsetting. When I called the doctor again the nurse informed me I was taking up too much of her time and that sometimes doctor's misdiagnose and that I should have never retrieved the lab results without consulting with them first. I would not recommend this doctor whatsoever, I was very disturbed and displeased by the lack of professionalism."

He is a good doctor. I found this rating on another site about his brother, and I find it upsetting, and for this reason I am glad I changed doctors. Dr Bueso is just about the WORST doctor I have ever seen. First it took me a month to get an appointment with him since I was a new patient. Second he spoke very poor English. Third I checked my insurance bill after he performed a minor procedure on me and he made it seem like I had major surgery He was definitely scamming my insurance and I told my insurer so. He even let his son watch as I got an examination and I have a feeling he let his son do my procedure. I did not feel safe with him and my new doctor has told me I made the right choice to change doctors. It is also common knowledge that he performs late term abortions."

He is good...but my new endos nurse nicely explained that they choose to call with results for their patients asap over the phone because waiting even 1 month for an appointment might be to late and the patient may die... Dr. Rushfords staff cares very much...check him out he's on Hargrave near Willobrook.

I asked her about getting a tetanus shot and they were out of the serum for my first 2 visits. Then, when I finally did receive the shot, they charged me $100 cash. I was a bit skeptical about the charge so I went online then called my insurance company who confirmed that yes, they do cover the shot. I tried for a week to contact Dr. Chacko's office for a refund but they either never returned my call or the answering service picked up (even at several different times during their business hours). I finally went up to the office and sat there until finally, Dr. Chacko (through her office personnel) issued me a check for $100. She did not even want to discuss it. If that's the way they want to run their greedy office, I will go elsewhere."

Many times messages are not given to the PA. Personally I prefer The Woodlands location over the main site. When I pay money for their tests (they own the equipment...)I expect thorough testing and a quick turn around on receiving the test results.

Then moved on to the next thing and never addressed my chest pain again. She is very argonat and talked down to me. She then proceeded to suggest I get thyroid testing done so I did. I came in a few days later and got a large amount of blood taken and now over three weeks later and over $400 dollars spent I have not heard from this women and am left with no answers.

From the first time we met her till now, we have been extremely satisfied. She has moved offices since then and we now drive from Katy to see her because she cares and remembers her paitents. Occasionally you have to wait a little long for an appointment, but it is because she takes time with every patient rather than just booking patients every 15 minutes. There is never a long wait in the lobby with 15 other people like many doctors. As far as her support staff, they are improving. However, if you have any complaints, Kelley will address them immediately and properly. She is wonderful and caring. Try her, you'll love the care she provides."

I wanted to request a letter for my insurance company so I went in person to request it. They left a note for the Doctor. After 2 weeks of calling back and forth with not many answers to whether they could do it or not they told me I would have to request it in writing and they were going to charge me so much for it. That would have been fine if they could have come up with that answer when I stopped by the first day or maybe even the first week. By that time I had already gotten letter from 2 other doctors with no charge, so I said no thanks!"

Her office staff is rude and has constantly done things like not have correct prescriptions sent to the drug store. They have also sent prescriptions without the dosage. Another example of the quality of service is the time that the Doctor's office sent us an email informing us the time for my mothers appointment was 8:15 AM, when we had been told it was 9:00 AM. Upon arrival we where told they NEVER have appointments before for 9:00 AM. They were very rude especially when we produced their email. Never did they ever say a mistake was made. That same visit, a prescription was sent to the pharmacy without giving them a dosage. This was on a Friday. After THREE CALLS to the office they never corrected the error until the following MONDAY. I should point out that my mother was seeing the Doctor with bronchitis and possible pneumonia and the prescription was for her antibiotic. DO NOT USE this Doctor!"

She should be responsible enough to find out the name Doctor is complaining about instead of writing a complaint on this rating page. I think it is totally unfair to Dr. Yaa Amoah-Honny since she is not the medical provider who attended to this patient. People have to be respectful of other people's profession and direct their comments to the appropriate person not people by affiliation of a partner or co-worker. I applaud Dr. Yaa Amoah-Honny in her professional practice of medicine. Francesca Bamfo

The doctor that came after her was incredibly helpful but had to spend much time undoing the damage done.After waiting 2 hrs. we left w/out telling anyone. We've received no follow-up."

Her nurse is the rudest nurse I've ever encountered according to me and others at Methodist I've spoken to. The office manager doesn't have a clue of what's going on because of the numerous mistakes that have occurred with my scheduling and blood test with no resolution. I have given up and am looking for a new doctor because all they've done is wasted my time on every visit with their mistakes.

He was arrogant, dramatic and didn't communicate anything. He did some basic range of motion tests then abruptly walked out of the room. He never told me what was wrong, what to do, or where to go. Even the nurse was left wondering what the hell was going on. I never received a shred of paperwork. It's like he suddenly drifted into another dimension. I wouldn't let this doctor treat a cinder block...and I'm not joking. He comes with high credentials but he must have retired twenty years ago and not told anyone,"

First week of surgery is very painful despite what they tell you; make sure you ask for extra pain meds because I had to ask for more. He also provided a nasal spray pain med because I could not keep pills down. He has superb bedside manners and ALWAYS patiently willing to answer ANY Q's you have 24/7.

I made an appointment with this doctor for hypothyroid symptoms. He did spend about an hour with me (wow!) the first appointment and agreed that I did present with symptoms of hypothyroidism. However, he did not want to have blood work done for all of the tests that I requested that were associated with hypothyroidism and peri-menopause. He requested TSH, free T4, free T3, total T4, total T3, and Lh, + FSH. He wanted to schedule my follow up one month later, but I told him I could not wait that long - I felt physically terrible and was unable to go to work. He LIED to me, telling me that the blood tests take time and then scheduled me for three weeks later. At the follow up appointment (not before), he realized that only three of the six blood tests were done! Because these three results were in the ""normal"" ranges (which are WIDE ranges to include 95% of the population and have nothing to do with OPTIMAL or HEALTHY levels), he declared that I did not suffer from hypothyroidism or menopause (I was concerned about peri-menopause, not menopause! I still have my regular cycle!). He suggested that it was all in my head and that I needed to spend time with a psychiatrist! He completely dismissed me as a person and a patient. He knows nothing regarding thyroid issues, nor how to ask WHY a patient may have symptoms with some blood work in the normal range. Extremely disappointing and frustrating. I was so shocked and angry. I know my own body - as all patients do. He wasted two months of my time. I continued to decline, but finally found a doctor much more familiar with hypothyroid symptoms, someone who was willing to treat me based on my symptoms (imagine that!) and do more testing. You must be your own advocate! You must continually research your symptoms and conditions. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH DR. ABHISHEK KANSARA for thyroid issues, or any other chronic condition."

Everything went well until he enter the room. He was really rude and not helpful at all. When I told him what I was there for and he had to note down my history he was very annoyed with me every time I added to my history. He would sigh very loudly and slam the mouse on the table as he nodded his head in annoyance. I felt so uncomfortable to the point I wanted to cry. He didn't even want to help me and was rude and kept telling me ""well what else do you want me to add we already have a lot here."" When the nurse came in to give me my vaccine she apologized to the nurse for taking so long with me like if I wasn't in the room. This has been the worst experience I've ever had with a doctor. I wasn't even taken care properly because he did not want to do his job in helping me get better. He just wrote me down a prescription and send me off my way.

The waiting room is sparse, which isn't a problem, except the large area rug is filthy so you wait past your appointment time in an already unclean environment. Dr. Bordon and Dr. Juan Barriga are in practice together. When my husband needed a sleep study, Dr. Bordon made him see Dr. Barriga who then ordered the test. When the results were in, we made an appointment with Dr. Barriga to review them but when my husband returned, they made him see Dr. Bordon who told him he would have to come again to speak with Dr. Barriga to get the results. They required him to have 4 visits plus the test (initial appt w/ Dr. Bordon, referral appt to Dr. Barriga, test, ""switched"" appt with Dr. Bordon, and final with Dr. Barriga).

She is also very slow to refill prescriptions, even when given a month's notice that the prescription is about to run out. Over two years I've been under her ""care"", this has happened 5 times - twice I've gone 1 to 2 weeks without meds. The reason I have left her care was that she arbitrarily lowered a dosage of a medicine that I had taken for years at refill time, without having any scientific reason (no tests, no data) to justify the reduction. This dosage had been originally adjusted by a specialist, long before, who had done the lab work and taken the time to adjust the dosage to the proper level."

She has very bad arthritis, unable to walk, stand or site for more than 10 minutes, she has Asthma, allergy, severe depression and anxiety. She does not drive and take metro lift to go to her doctors. Dr Talieh was so unconsidered and careless that was not going to sign my mom’s renewal form for Metro Lift. She was telling my mom to get ride from family and friends or take the city bus. My mom told her she does not have anybody and cannot take 2 or 3 buses to get to her office which would take few hours.
Dr Talieh answer was that she did not want to lose her license, meaning that my mom is not disable and it would be a lie to use metro. I asked her if she would say this to her own mother.
Another occasion we were out of town, mom got a bad UTI, which was a reoccurrence so Dr. Taleih knew the history. When I called to get antibiotic order to a pharmacy there, they said she would not do it and my mom needs to go to a doctor there. We were there only 3 days and had to find a doctor, give urine test and by the time we were getting back she might had some medication. I told her office manager that she knows my mom history and why she does not, she told me no doctor in USA will do it. I called another doctor and they did it. When mom came back and went to see her still after antibiotic had UTI, and Dr Taleih said oh I am sorry, did not trust you, I am afraid to lose my license.
She thinks all of her patients are crooks and try to scam her or somebody. If you are in her office, she is good and follows up, but don’t ask her to sign any kind of paper.
I found another doctor for my mom. Dr Taleih is clueless about her oath to care for her patients, only scared of her license."

Dr. Hyman as a physician and employee of AMS, had seen me numerous times. In 2008, I informed him that my medical condition had worsened from the past. No examination for this was done. The next time he saw me I informed him my condition was much poorer, but Dr. Hyman did no further test and no examination. I finally had to go to an outside physician for treatment for the liver problems and surgery. He later told me that he did not think I needed any testing and it seems it was not a problem for him to disregard this instead of taking any precautionary measures. Dr. Hyman has also entered in mis-leading information into my medical record and stated later that he would stand behind this bad information. His lack of care and concern with patient’s health and safety as I have found is a problem.

He had to study the blood test results for 1/2 hour while I was sitting there and then said that I needed them all redone one week after I had them the first time and had given 7 tubes of blood. He prescribed Vitamin E, which I checked out because he made me nervous and never told me why I needed E. I found out that Vitamin E is very dangerous for someone with low platelets and he knew that mine are very low. Then I tried to get my blood test results. The nurse argued that she had given them to me, which she had not because I looked for them in the papers as soon as I got home.

I called at 3:20pm and told them I was on my way so that they would prepare the papers and I wouldn't wait for long.I spent more than 20 mins in the office till my papers were ready and left. I took the papers and told them that they should expect a very bad review about their carelessness. I don't understand why a doctor would ask for tests and not look at the results knowing that his patient is in pain. I would not recommend this practice to anyone."

Luckily, I am not her patient but poorly my mom is. What kind of the family doctor is if patients can not report and question her about the current symptoms in front of her with the office visit? Why my mom needs another appointment (if it is not all about the monies...). The poor explanations that my mom need another appointment because her scheduled is for wellness exam is not a satisfied answers. I understand that even the doctor office need to make business, but please put some ethics and show off your care."
898,Dr. Connie L. Pham,Houston,Texas,Internist / Geriatrician, Female,5,2.55,2014-09-09T00:38:53.066Z,1,1,1,1,1,"Worse & Rudest doctor EVER EVER EVER! She is one doctor who lacks competency and patient care. She tries to swindle her patients for office visit money. The doctor and her staff also misled me regarding the ""urgency"" of my situation rushing me to come in right away. I asked them several times over the phone to please tell me what are my results. Mind you I have the right to know since I am the patient. They were reluctant to give me my results via phone, and said it was urgent to come in & to start ""treatment"". After hearing the tone of their voice--her receptionists-- making my matter sound so petrifying, I rushed to the doctor's office in tears and scared to death. Once I arrived, they tell me that my situation is not really that bad and there's no need to panic. At this moment, I'm confuse of what to think after being told that... I ended up waiting about a hour and a half to finally see the doctor. When she finally saw me, she did not discuss any kind of solid treatment plans with me. She only told me of my test result. I tried to ask her questions regarding my treatment, and she failed to answer me to the best of her knowledge. Instead, she requested that I set up another appointment with her this upcoming week. After I left her office, two hours later she called me to let me know there was actually a second part to my test and she just ""received"" the results. At this point I'm livid because she never once mentioned anything about it being a two part test, and and she was aware of this. She purposely withheld information from me pertaining to the diagnosis she says I ""supposedly"" have without confirming all the test results for accuracy. She caused me a great amount of emotional distress. Not only did she do that, I also end up canceling my leaving out of town due to the ""urgency"" of my situation.
A couple of days after the visit, her office called to confirm my second appointment. I let them know that, I would like to talk to the doctor instead because I have a few questions pertaining to my diagnosis and such. They said they will let the doctor know and she will call me back. She finally calls me back, I ask her a few questions and concerns. A lot of her response was she does not know. At this point, I'm flustered because of her replies and wondering how did she even get her medical license. I'm not sure if she even went to medical school at this point. So I let her know that I am going to go to a different doctor for a second opinion. This is when she gets angry. As I was on the verge of asking her another question, she--the doctor, Dr. Connie Pham-- says hastily to me, ""I have patients I have to see right now."" Then she hangs up on me without even letting me finish my question. I'm going to another doctor and getting a second opinion. After all this, I would not recommend anyone to have her as their attending physician. By far the worse experience of my life. I will definitely try and report her to the medical board. I will also take this to social media and any other course of action by any means necessary for the emotional distress she has caused me."

I had to ask more questions just to get more info out of him. I saw his receptionists and aids more than i actually saw him. You go in and out of his office quickly, but don't expect to find out valuable information regarding your health. If you value your well-being, please choose another doctor. He is more into ordering studies for you, but fails to deliver a proper diagnosis."

It is too bad that I have a heart murmur and other issues. He totally missed very important issues with my condition. As a resident doctor at Baylor College of Medicine in the Cardiology department, he really failed at this one. Dr. Cota is a physician that I would never want to have attended to me or any member of my family. It is also too bad his professor (Nasser M Lakkis, M.D.) stated that he also examined me (which he did not) and then charged Medicare for the visit. Poor quality all the way around."

The nurse that I see before seeing the doctor is so sweet & professional. The only thing that I' not pleased with is that you have to wait so long to get in for a Physical, which is usually a 4-5 month wait, but I understand that he is very busy.

Whenever I go in, the workers all seem so unhappy. It's not cheerful or welcoming at all. I had to wait 2.5 months for an annual check-up. Way too long. Also, Dr. Fridley does not review his notes well -- always asks for dosage of medicine he prescribed (he should know that from his notes). He barely checks anything and doesn't seem to wash his hands between patients. He also makes you come in for a prescription refill after 6 months -- I assume, just to make money off the visit. He never asks if you have any concerns -- just looks over charts and orders tests without discussing them with you. I always hope he'd change his manners/protocol with patients but that's not happening. I will change before I need the one prescription I take refilled."

Was condescending towards me by making a comment I will never forget. What she wasn’t aware of is that my husband and I are both in the medical field and stable. But because I look young and was in my early 20’s she made a comment. I can’t speak for her knowledge as a provider but she does lack bedside manners and professionalism.

She is very knowledgeable and has a good bedside manner. She takes the time to answer all of my questions and never makes me feel like a question or complaint is insignificant. She does not perform tests that she deems unnecessary, even when I wish she would (like a DEXA bone scan one year after being diagnosed with and put on meds for osteopenia). She will not prescribe meds that she feels are not indicated, even when I ask for them (like testosterone to help increase my sex drive--I am a middle-aged female). I respect her for that."

We both went in but saw different doctors. He ended up with antibiotics and I was told I have mono. I told her this is somthing that I get like 4 times a year. She refused to give me any medicine. I had to pay another 25.00 to go the next day and got antibiotics from the other doctor. She is speedy but sucks at her diagnosis would not reccomend her

The doc didn't spend time to touch and see where it hurts. Instead he performed some usual physicals (bending knees, etc.) to see if some neurological problems involved, but ruled out x-ray or MRI scan of the back. Finally convinced me to take pain killer (?). He sent the prescription, one copy to mail order and one to local pharmacy and made me to pay for both the orders!! Totally not patient friendly in my opinion."

She speaks in a condescending manner... suggested I ""just get a hysterectomy"" (even though that wasn't my reason for being there) so nonchalantly like it's the normal thing to do... and then continued to tell me ""if nothing else, at least do it so you'll look better"" referring to my enlarged uterus due to fibroids. Plus, when prescribing any medicine, she makes sure to write BRAND NAME ONLY on the prescription so that she continues to screw you over on the amount of money you spend on healthcare. I called her office twice to ask for a new prescription and my pharmacy called as well, but still no response in 2 days."

Staff and punctuality were NOT factors in this setting. I found Dr. Boateng very pleasant and knowledgeable with excellent communication skills. She coordinated very well with my hospital cardiologist and regular Kelsey team of doctors. In addition, she rated very highly with me because she didn't automatically discount information I gave her about how my body reacts to certain situations and medications and worked with me to set up the best treatment for me."

Telling u that needs more tests after waiting 2 hrs.....can find more qualified doctors just within a mile. Spoke with past patients and employees and they had similar experience.

Although sometimes the medical tests seem superfluous, it definitely has led to finding the right diagnosis in my case in the past. At first, I thought, what's the need for all this besides taking more of my money. But in the end, I was glad to have such a thorough check up that allowed them to finally pinpoint certain things that other doctors could not. I guess the doctor really knows what he's doing, although it may not seem like it at first with all the tests and whatnot. Just thought I'd add my two cents!"

This doctor is contracted as a PCP provider and as a PCP provider you are responsible for submitting referrals to specialists for the ongoing healthcare of the patient. Dr. Uddin dropped the ball not just once but twice. His staff is constantly turning over and they are not equipped to provide patient care! He uses his medical assistant as his referral submitter; therefore, she cannot get to her referrals until after clinic which leaves a small window of time to process a few referrals a day! If your referral entails some extra leg work you can forget about getting it processed and he is likely to dismiss you as a patient for taking up more time than they want to give you! Because of their lack of detail needed for my surgery the referral was not submitted timely in May. In Jan they submitted my endocrinologist referral to the incorrect location which caused it to keep getting denied for 3 months until I figured out why. Beware of incompetency!"

I think he must get kick backs from Global Sleep as he sent me to them after I said I only wanted to go to a place that was in network but they are not in network. I am being charged 2645.84 for one night of the study. This is the truth!

His PA's are idiots to say the least. They just agree with EVERYTHING you say and NEVER give you advice. Everyone in the office is rude and trashy--if you actually HAVE insurance like I do, they treat you like an outcast. They assume everyone has Medicaid. The office and staff are dirty and they never have the right vaccinations available. It cost me $70 to get my 10 month old's cough checked. If you would like to actually SEE your pedi-get a different one than Uddin!!!"

They could not find my labwork or other tests even though I called and asked if the paperwork had been emailed to their office before I arrived for my appt. I was told yes, that they had received it but when I went in they could not find it. I was told by the dr and the receptionist they would find it and call me, they never called me. The nurse gave me someone else's prescription..thank goodness I noticed it before I left his office. I WILL BE CHANGING DOCTORS. Dr Uddin get your staff under control!!"

Dr. Kulieve himself seems very pleasant and professional. But he is near impossible to get in to see if you are actually sick. Twice now, I have called for appointments for illnesses I had right then. Neither time was his staff willing to even attempt to work me in the same day. To the contrary, each time I was told I would have to set an appointment for five days or more later. In that time, a minor infection can become serious and a serious condition can become even worse. Dr. Kuliev's staff seems unable to appreciate this. When I have seen Dr. Kuliev, he was fine; no problems. But that was a simple physical that was set over a week in advance. If you are actually sick NOW, you've got a problem, if he's your doctor."

The day of the appointment I get a call from his office saying he would not be in and that they had to cancel my appointment. They could not reschedule me until like two weeks later. I was suffering from terrible migraines and they did not care. Just the fact the a doctor would cancel an appointment less than 24 hours before it is scheduled without being able to provide a solution to the patients problem (trying to fit him in that same day at a different time perhaps) speaks a lot about the type of Dr. and person he is. Stay away from this Dr!

Will NOT return phone calls, can never help you after-hours, takes days and multiple requests for medical forms you need, charges you to fill out a form for medicare or other reasons. Always rushed and doesn't take time to understand your needs. Focuses on one thing at a time, not whole body or whole person. Forces you to use his own on-site clinic for all tests and scans (and he orders many unnecessary tests and keeps you coming back for more). He bordered on abusive to my 85-year-old mother. I am so glad we got her out from under his care. She is no longer over-medicated and doing much better."

I have not seen any benefits from the few visits I could catch them. They seem to be lost without a purpose. They set appointments and never show.. yes they never show! They never return their phone calls. If you happen to catch them on site they promise to return the monies they accepted and never do. Please do not make the mistake we have made and the others waiting at the door for these people to decide to do their jobs and perform the services they promised. I have never rated anyone because I feel people make mistakes yet this is something I need to say to help you not make the mistake I did. Find a real doctor with a real staff who cares and does not lie or steal. This is not what a doctor is supposed to do yet they do this consistantly. RUN!!!!

No. Does she care about your feelings about your treatment or lack of if you're seeing her? No. Does she know how to correctly diagnose autoimmune diseases? No. Is she nice? Do you like scowling looks and being berated or yelled at if you question her? I left her and found another rheumatologist who appropriately diagnosed me when she scoffed and started me immediately on medications and I went from being unable to walk back to jogging. Last question to inform you of her ineptness; Do you like being a blind Guinea pig? Don't bother with this doctor you'll just waste time and money.

Out of breath for several minutes just from walking from the adjacent exam room. Got blood test and told to come back in two days for results - not necessary to make an appointment because it would only take 5 minutes. Came back and she made me wait nearly 3 HOURS. Nurse said the doctor was aware we were there. Doctor was cackling and laughing with a couple of patients most of the time I waited. And sure enough, it only took her 5 minutes once she finally waddled out of the exam room. Totally disgusted. So disrespectful. Never, ever will come back.

I got the date of my last menstrual wrong and he hounded me about it, telling me over and over that I needed to tell him the exact date and wouldn't let me speak until I had it figured out. Even then, he asked me multiple times if there was any possibility of me being pregnant. I insisted over and over that there was no way, even giving him the month I'd last had the chance to be, and he kept asking.
I was feeling pain in my arm and chest, and when I told him about my chest pain he got mad and seriously, started yelling. He asked, was I there to inquire about shoulder pain or chest pain? Why couldn't it be both. He wanted to refer me to a cardiologist, but I told him I'd have to seek a clinic that actually took BCBS if I wasn't in immediate danger. He rolled his eyes at me. Awful."

No pride in his work, and no care for the patient's needs.

He didn't even want to help me or try to diagnose the problem. All he did was refer me to a surgeon (which costs another $200 for me). You figure he can do a little more for what I paid to see him. Seems like he's trying to get through as many patients as possible without diagnosing them so that he can't get sued for a misdiagnosis.

We were very displeased that this doctor gave different bits of information to different family members, forcing us to carefully consult one another to assemble a picture that was still largely incomplete. I don't feel qualified to rate this physician in regards to punctuality or knowledge but but I can confidently state that nothing he told us was particulary helpful in understanding my mother's condition or planning her care."

He reached under my shirt and gripped and jiggles my breast and squeezed it and did so again right before I left from the outside. He is a leach and a predator. Be weary and STAY AWAY if you do not want to be assaulted as well. This is a dangerous man. His office is filthy and full of dust and there is mold on the ceiling and peeling wallpaper. This is not a clean practice in any way. He should not be in practice, he should be behind bars or at least have his license removed. Do NOT GO to this predator!"

Many of his patients seem to be older, as is he and this sort of makes him hard to relate to as a 20-something woman. He was helpful with nutrition information and asks routine questions. The office itself looks like it came out of the 60s and that's okay too. :)"

Pro: Staff is nice. Dr. spends a very generous amount of time with the patient. Considers patient’s emotional/mental well-being and its influence on health. Can come in for blood work early in the morning (on a different day from seeing the MD in case you need to fast). Con: Dr. recommends vegetarianism to patients. Must wait a very long time some days (because she spends a lot of time with each patient). Waiting room is often crowded (shared with other doctors). When making a diagnosis, she was quick to report test results but gave no emotional prep before delivering bad news. Overall: Limited recommendation depending on patient’s personality.

I went there for a new prescription for anti-depressants, I've been on them for 5 years and also for pain medication for severe arthritis in my knees and hands. I have had 4 knee surgeries for arthritis. He did not even look at my knees, gave me 30 days of pain meds,no refills. He told me I would have to see a pain management specialist for that. I also had a general daily ability summary for my SSDI application, he would not fill it out. He wanted me to come back for a follow-up in 4 weeks which I explained I could not afford. His suggestion was for me to get a County Welfare ""Gold"" card or go to Ben Taub. I totally wasted my time and money going to him at all."

Should a person who has had a liver transplant be given a second one when the first fails after 3 years? Are age limitations appropriate? Does the news media figure in the final decision? Should the final decision be based on the persons value to society? A nobel laureate or a child with potentially more years of questionable contribution to society? Are the funds justified for the transplant concept when we are not providing for programs needed by the general population. How many of the 20% on food stamps would benefit by reallocation of transplant funds to the education of our children? Hard decisions require that our emotions are not always the pathway to correct decisions. However this is resolved there will be pain for some. The concept that we are all equal is more biblical than realistic. Are children living in poverty in our country lives that could be saved by a different type of transplant."

Dr. Yang wanted to do an expensive test that would have cost over $700, but failed to do a simple x-ray that would have clearly identified the problem. I couldn't afford an almost $800 test, so he treated me with Cymbalta, with side effects that worsened greatly over time. Cymbalta was over $200 once my insurance ran out, and instead of helping me slowly get off Cymbalta, he referred me to a government program for indigents. I indeed was not indigent, but I was indignant! I have come to believe that he is among the set of doctors who receive bonuses from pharmaceutical companies for prescribing their newest and shiniest pills, and that he receives bonuses from insurance companies for not referring patients to specialists. It's a shame, I liked him personally, but now feel my medical well-being was greatly compromised by Dr. Stanley Yang."

I have been a patient of Dr. Patolia for almost 5 years but I am now looking for another Doctor. When inside his office one-on-one with Dr. Patolia I never feel rushed and his concern for my well-being seems authentic. However, the rude, unorganized, rushed chaos in the rest of the office is inescapable. I have always given Ivy and the staff the benefit of the doubt because they seemed under-staffed. In my last few visits to the office I have noticed Ivy has help now and the office is not as busy (loosing clients other than just me perhaps). Even though, Ivy’s rude, rushed and unorganized behavior still exist. It has not improved at all!
After being a loyal patient for almost 5 years I was turned away without my crucial medications just before an out-of-town business trip - all because I expressed my dissatisfaction to Ivy. This is serious health-threatening behavior. Ivy refused to give me the script even though this was my second time being in the office away from my busy schedule to get it. When I asked if I could speak with the Doctor Ivy stated she made the decisions at Dr. Patolia’s office..and sadly I think she is right and that is something Dr. P must change or he will continue to lose once loyal patients. A week prior at my scheduled appointment she hurried me out of the office saying she would call it in. From experience I knew that call would never happen so I asked again and was rudely and loudly told “it would be called in”. I could not understand the writing on the card for my return visit. When I tried to confirm the date I was given the we are too busy right now so kindly leave hand motion. I noticed it was lunch-time and maybe I was going to cut into someone’s break by a minute or two. I still do not know the date for the return visit and others I have asked can not understand the writing either. It doesn’t matter anymore because I will not be returning...unless office personnel change.
Another reason I have put up with the terrible attitude of Ivy and staff is because of the convenience of the office being located by work and St. Joseph having a pick-up/drop-off service for my office. I thought I was saving time. Looking back, remembering all the time I have spent on the phone, on hold, making multiple trips, conversations with the pharmacy, trying to get lab results, etc due to the general attitude and unorganzized chaotic work environment set by Ivy I realize I was never saving any time at all.
After almost 5 years I am no longer a patient of Dr. Patolia. I wish him the best and hope he recognizes that the way his staff treats the customers is just as important as his being a good and pleasant doctor because it is his staff we must speak with for almost all issues concerning scripts, insurance, billing, lab results, appointments..
Good bye Dr. P -

The Dr. was pleasant but his staff on the other hand, was not at all. I originally went to him for a referral to see my dermatologist. I gave the staff my dermatologist's information I needed to see and was told it would be taken care of ASAP. After calling multiple times to remind them to send the fax, it still has not been done. I finally received a call by one of the staff 3 weeks after my initial appointment stating the fax was sent. 3 WEEKS. Once I called my dermatologist to make an appointment they then stated there was no fax received. I then call Dr. Patiloa's staff and was told they would get to the stack of papers the following day. 2 MONTHS have now passed and still no word of my fax being sent over. I have now given up and since changed my PCP in order to receive a referral! A terrible experience all together. I wouldn't recommend anyone to seek service from this office. I'd give zero stars but unfortunately that is not an option."

I know the files was sent because I confirmed my with previous doctor the day before. Patolia didn't provide any care or advice because he stated he didn't have my files. Long story short, Patolia's staff called me back within 15 minutes after I left and claimed they just received my files. He basically, wanted me to get off my meds and revaluate me...which was frustrating, because if he was going to do this he could have told me at my appointment. Overall, Patolia seemed to be more experienced and more knowledgable about my condition compared to my last doctor. Patolia also took his time to answer all my questions, and even suggested alternative meds that would be better for me in the long run pending test results. I rank his staff and work efficiency low, but higher in medical skills."

As a person I like her just fine however she is not capable of treating me properly...I have a chronic illness she does not understand. It has been ok until recently when I started having increased symptoms- she seems frustrated, and just tries to throw meds at the problems rather than come up with solutions. I am fairly knowledgable and do research a lot on my own...I share it with her and rather than looking at it she says she doesn't have any knowledge of it and I might want to consider a specialist. I ask her who she suggests and she has to think about it then never follows through. I finally found someone on my own but now even general care things are being neglected. She also sites being responsible with healthcare dollars as a reason not to run diagnostic labs. So...she is great if you go twice a year when you get the flu, or if you want meds....she is more than happy to prescribe practically anything I ask for but if you want individualized care she cannot seem to provide it."

1055,Dr. Jaclyn H.

Even threatened to turn us in for Medicare fraud if we did. She thought patient should go home to die. Even unhooked IV to check patient out, just to be overruled by hospital heart specialist. The staff cardiac doctor at least got the patient stabilized before releasing. We had to leave Hermann, visit new specialist on our own, and be admitted to a different hospital to get a pacemaker put in that she needed. It helped tremendously. Dr Harrison did not want us to dismiss the admitting cardiologist, who had not checked on his patient, repeatedly dumped the patient on the ER without any instructions or follow up, and did not communicate adequately with the family. Dr. Harrison was a fresh internist graduate, but she should know that each patient is entitled to a second opinion and to switch specialists whenever they desire, without her permission!"

But, there is nothing more painful than to witness the administration of narcotics bringing about an artificially induced death, where a family member struggles desperately to express feelings, while being prevented from articulating due to narcotic overdose.

She severly overmedicated him, had him on such an overload of antibiotics that it caused neuro deficits and was very lax with his care. Her and her team only cared about doing unnecessary tests that ran up the bills but were not interested in anything except how to get him out of the hospital. She discharged him to home while he was dehydrated, with a pressure of 68 over 45 in the ambulance. We had to take him back to the ER less than 24 hours later and she refused to admit him. She sent us home with 13 prescriptions for him to take and allowed him to go home without even a nurse at the house to help administer his meds and his insulin. With her lack of concern and inexperience she help to contribute to his death. We moved him to another facility where he got excellent care but it was too late.

When I have tried to talk to him he is on his cell phone!! I came from my old doctor who passed away. I gave him a list of my medications and it took forever to get them filled (I had to ask 3 or 4 times) and he would not give me the dosage of Tramadol that had been taking for 5 years!! He wanted to refer me to a Pain Specialist which I did not understand why. The final straw was when he told me that my kidney function was low on my blood test results; however he never went into detail. I had to research about it online. When I researched it I learned that I had Stage 3 Chronic Kidney Disease. He never referred me to a Nephrologist who specializes in Kidney Disease so I found a doctor on my own. He also noted that diagnoses on my records but I didn't see it until I printed out the whole thing from his online portal for the new specialist. The specialist told me that it was OK to take the pain medication that I was previously taking. Bottom line is that they are rude and will not communicate with you except through a portal!! They are supposed to be a ""Christian"" clinic? They are not Christian's. You don't drop a patient because that person wants a second opinion. I was going to drop him anyway and search for a new PCP.

I brought my dad to MD Anderson for his appointments for 5 1/2 years. He had slow growing Non-Hodgkin’s Follicular Grade 1 Lymphoma and his doctor was Dr. Jason Westin. My dad was remarkably healthy the entire 5 1/2 years and he commuted between Florida and Houston. He went into remission, but the cancer came back after a year and he was on the watch and wait for treatment so he was one of Dr Westin’s CURRENT patients. With his type of cancer it was not a matter of if it comes back, but when.
My father was hospitalized in Florida in October 2018 after getting the hiccups from anesthesia from knee replacement surgery. He was given a drug called Thorazine for 2 1/2 months which caused an overdose and liver failure. The doctors and oncologist in Florida thought he should be brought back to MD Anderson because they felt something may have changed with his lymphoma. Dr Westin refused to take him back and even said to the oncologist there that “he did not want him back” because he didn’t think it was lymphoma related even though pictures showed tumors and calcification on his liver AND the largest tumors he previously had were on his liver and spleen and Thorazine is known to cause liver issues in elderly and people with compromised immune systems. My dad ended up with a very aggressive form of Large B-Cell Lymphoma and died on February 17, 2019.
I personally visited the medical director and patient advocate at MD Anderson and wrote them a formal written complaint. They have yet to respond to anything. 🦗
My dad was perfectly healthy for the first 5 1/2 years, but when he needed MD Anderson the most they left him to die in a small Florida hospital. MD Anderson is a state hospital so they are protected by Texas laws, but not by social media. Other oncologists have told me that minimally Dr. Westin should have moved up his January 2019 appointment. Seeing him sooner most likely would have resulted in a different treatment plan and outcome. MD Anderson’s marketing slogan of “where you go first matters” is definitely true. They should practice what they market and take current patients back even in between appointments. MD Anderson employees have said they are overwhelmed with too many too patients and their ER is always backed up. My goal is to get MD Anderson to commit to never leaving a patient to die that is out of state or at another hospital as they did with my dad.
On a side note, Dr. Westin mentioned at an appointment in early 2018 that he hoped he wouldn’t be there for my dad’s next visit because planned to run for Congress. I wondered at the time how much his heart was still into being a doctor and now I completely question it. I would never recommend him or MD Anderson for their lack of response to the situation. "

1115,Dr. Monica B. Patel,Houston,Texas,Internist / Geriatrician, Female,1,1,2012-06-20T22:45:34Z,1,1,1,1,1,This doctor was extremely inappropriate. I took my husband in for a appointment and she as was very flirtatious towards him. Rubbing a patients thigh is WRONG. I saw this with my own eyes as i walked back into the room. My husband and I are so disgusted with her conduct. STAY AWAY FROM HER or run as fast as you can if shes your doctor. Houston has great doctors and with plenty of more knowledge than this woman. I hope this doesnt happen to anyone else.

1118,Dr. Nguyen T. Luu,Houston,Texas,Internist / Geriatrician, Male,1,1,2011-10-25T16:35:58Z,1,1,1,1,1,"Dr. Luu was the admitting doctor and internist in charge of my father at Bayshore. It was two weeks before we ever saw the mysterious Dr. Luu. I have no complaints about the other doctors who saw my father, but we never saw Dr. Luu, not even after my father had a serious setback and was sent to the ICU. We spent every possible hour in the hospital room and never met him. When we finally demanded to see Dr. Luu he was very negative in front of the patient, yes he was ""rude, arrogant, and just plain mean"". Can't really judge his knowledge because we have had so little contact with him. How can you ever treat a patient without meeting him or his family? He may have a fine medical mind (but who knows) but he is seriously flawed as a compassionate human being. When I check that my ""rating is based on MY OWN experience with this doctor"" it's almost a lie because we once met him once in 17 days."
