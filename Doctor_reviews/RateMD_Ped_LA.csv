Mandelberg,Los Angeles,California, Pediatricians , Male,22,5,2018-10-12T04:59:54.892Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr Mandelburg is a fantastic doctor, he diagnosed our daughter with autism and the level of care, consideration, knowledge and attention to detail that he showed during the process was exceptional, we are so grateful to have his help and ongoing support with our daughter. We would highly recommend him."
2,Dr. Joshua H. Mandelberg,Los Angeles,California, Pediatricians , Male,22,5,2018-10-03T18:50:33.923Z,5,5,5,5,5,"We are forever grateful for Dr. Mandelberg's care of our son! He has worked with our son since he was 9 months old and now he is four. He is extremely thorough from various evaluations to interviewing current teachers and interventionists and listening to the concerns of the parents and grandparents. Additionally, he is very organized in putting together his assessment and recommendations for continued care. We have seen great improvement in our son's development and will continue to see Dr. Mandelberg to track it. It's also extremely helpful that his assistant is kind, caring and thoughtful. Truly a gem of a team!"
3,Dr. Joshua H. Mandelberg,Los Angeles,California, Pediatricians , Male,22,5,2018-04-13T21:50:48.644Z,5,5,5,5,5,"No parent would ever want to hear that their child has a disorder, specially one that does not have a cure. Dr. Mandelberg is the beacon of hope that each family needs. His diagnosis is based on an extensive and thorough assessment that is not rushed and as if you are getting something from a drive-through window. Instead it is well organized and put together. It is build around the child's strength while at the same time pointing a complete list of how to focus on all areas of opportunity so the child would start receiving the appropriate help and therapy that is required and beneficial.
Dr. Mandelberg not only looks at the issue as a dedicated and caring physician but also puts himself as the parent and care giver of the child by trying to plan the best care possible for the child while protecting and preserving the child's innocence.
You hear cliche that there are angels on earth among us, and I am sure it is true and Dr. Mandelberg is one of them. "

8,Dr. Joshua H. Mandelberg,Los Angeles,California, Pediatricians , Male,22,5,2017-04-20T16:41:45.649Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Josh is truly a Godsend. Realizing you have a child with special needs is a very emotional, uncertain and scary time but Dr. Josh’s kindness, intelligence, knowledge, and attentiveness helped calm our feasr. Instead of giving our son a basic assessment and blanket diagnosis he took the time to interview our son’s speech therapist, occupational therapist, behavioral therapist and teachers. He also assessed and visited our son at school. He got to the underlying issue of our son’s delay and presented a thorough report with excellent resources to get our son up to speed. Dr. Josh is extremely well known well respected in the community so he was also able to get our son spots in various programs that are nearly impossible to get in. He is an excellent resource with impeccable bedside manner who always makes himself available to his patients. I really can’t say enough positive things about him. I work in the medical field so I visit many Physicians day in and day out and Dr. Josh is by far the BEST."
9,Dr. Joshua H. Mandelberg,Los Angeles,California, Pediatricians , Male,22,5,2017-04-20T01:22:02.620Z,5,5,5,5,5,"We are extremely happy with Dr Mandelberg's office and his team. They are all very knowledgeable, extremely nice and accommodating. Dr Josh diagned my son with ASD when he was 2yrs and 4 months, he is very insightful and knowledgeable, calls me back within a day if I have any urgent questions and responds to all my emails in a timely manner. I feel like I have a great advocate for my child's needs and, in a situation where it is difficult to get a great advice, I trust Dr Mandelberg’s recommendation on any subject related to my son’s condition. I have already recommended him to anybody who might benefit from his services.
We are extremely happy with everything, if he was working with insurance we probably be even more happy but otherwise his entire team is wonderful and we feel very lucky to have the opportunity to be in his care.

Dr. Sloninsky immediately won our confidence with her intellect. As a scientist and a concerned parent, I insist upon knowing what is medical status of my child, why something may be happening and how to treat it. Moreover, I demand that his physician be thoroughly knowledgeable and intelligent in his or her field. From this perspective, Dr. Sloninsky is fantastic. She is superb at diagnosing problems and giving realistic assessments. Additionally, she shows a great deal of care with her patients. She will drop by, even when we're with another one of her doctors, to make sure our child is fine. We highly recommend her."

My daughter has a rare condition that my family pediatrician failed to diagnose. However, when I came to seek dr. Ben-Isaac’s opinion, he not only diagnosed her, but he explained me just looking at Nicole’s blood test results, why it could not be this or that disease, but PFAPA. I was very impressed by the professionalism and knowledge level of Dr. Ben-Isaac. I was in the correspondence with him regarding my daughter’s condition. In spite of his constant business he was always fast and prompt in his replies. Later on I had concern about my son. And the way Dr. Ben-Isaac was handling my concern, by calling me with test results after his work hours , just because he knew that I was worried, by cancelling his appointments to see us as soon as he could. There is still Hope for all of us in this world if such people like Doctor Eyal Ben-Isaac exist!"

He fights for us/him all the time. He was fast in dx'd our other son with a rare brain and spinal disorder. He is always there for us whether it is email or phone calls. He listens, he cares deeply for his patients and parents. He is also the Head of the Residency Program at Childrens. I can not say enough good things about this Dr. He is plain wonderful and we have turned down job offeres in other states to stay with Dr. Ben-Isaac.

She is patient, kind and takes her time and does not rush through appointments. The problem I have is that she practices at 2 locations (Chino Hills & Covina) which is always difficult to keep track of. Her office staff (at the Chino Hills location) is not friendly and never returns calls when she tells you she will. Her office hours are crazy, some days they are closed, some days they're closed for lunch for about 2 hours and when the operators says ""they should be back from lunch in an hour"", they are not. I really, like Dr. Patel but her hours, staff and 2 different locations are very inconvenient."

My son was a patient of her mothers, Pratima Patel. When she died, Falgooni took over the practice and is soaring with it. She may be young and new but she is a great doctor and makes herself available in ways and at times other doctors wouldn't. Dr. Patel's staff (the wonderful Delores and Maria) know me the moment I call and take care of us without hesitation, appointment or not. I love this doctor so much, if moving were ever an issue for me, continuing to have access to her would be a great deciding factor on where we would move."

He takes his time, is polite and is very friendly. He genuinely cares about all his patients. He also goes the extra mile to help out; I even heard that he carried a baby from the parking lot because the baby was too heavy for the mother. The office, especially around noon, is usually running 15-30 minutes late, which isn't unusual for a doctor's office.

We selected her for our newborn daughter after doing an extensive search and review of pediatricians in our area. She received great reviews and now that we are going to her, my husband and I can see why. She came to visit our newborn and us at the hospital each day we were there and really made sure all was well with all of us. She is warm, caring, and super sweet. I love how she works with our daughter and how she works with us as new parents. Dr. Asnani is super informed and knowledgeable. She takes her time to explain what she is doing and answer all of our questions. She always returns my phone calls timely and I never feel rushed in-person or over the phone. Recently, my daughter had a clogged tear duct. I did a lot of research on line on how to address and treat this common issue. When I called Dr Asnani to also get her opinion, she gave me a suggestion that I did not read anywhere in my own research - to use the nose cleaner (suction) to help remove the clog from the inside out. It was after adding in this treatment method when I really started to see the duct and eye clear. It was incredible. It is a testament to her years of experience. I feel really grateful to have such an experienced, knowledgeable, and warm pediatrician for our daughter. She comes with my highest review and recommendation."

She's definitely not in an HMO but in private practice in Los Angeles. The office is ancient and when the senior doctor retires, I hope she will do a makeover. However she's smart, sensitive, and thorough. My (pre-teen and teen) kids respect her and don't dislike going which is saying a lot. We got through all the HPV vaccines and she helped us with a possible metabolic problem as well"

I chose her as my daughter's pediatrician because she was knowledgable and on top of everything. She has great judgement and I trust her completely. She always calls me back promptly and give reassurance when needed. If its a well chikd visit she does not spend a lot of time but if your child is sick she will take lots of time with parent and child. She is also great at getting the kids all the services they need.
59,Dr. Heidi Woo,Los Angeles,California, Pediatricians , Female,15,3.85,2014-01-26T18:28:08Z,5,5,5,5,5,"We have been seeing Dr. Woo for both our children since they were born (5&2). It took me a while to find what I love about Dr. Woo but the first time I took my first son there when he was sick (I.e. not a well visit) I found it. And while she is often rushing through well visits, I discovered why. When my boys are sick she sits down and watches them. She observes and thinks and takes her time. I love that. And as others have said she is conservative on her approach with prescriptions which I like. There have been. Couple instances when her parenting advice doesn't mesh with my style but that's ok. I'm not there for that. She's shown compassion and care, knows my children, and I trust her judgement."
60,Dr. Heidi Woo,Los Angeles,California, Pediatricians , Female,15,3.85,2013-05-08T14:07:23Z,3.3,4,3,2,4,"The nurses are quite sweet and helpful; too bad, because Dr. Woo is not fit to be a pediatrician. While she may be a good 'Doctor' (and we do have one friend who still likes her because of her expertise), I think she is a failure as a pediatrician. She is always too harsh, too mean, too rough with my kids. She hurts their feelings, at a time when they're nervous anyway (going to Dr./getting shots.) She has zero sensitivity towards little patients. That she's also not great with the parents doesn't bother me - I can handle that. But that she's dismissive and physically and verbally unkind with the kids - not OK. I stayed with her way too long, thinking that I had to put up with this...Why?? She has an abusive personality. She is funny and even 'kind' sounding for the first 5 minutes, and then it's like she loses steam,and this other side comes out, and she can't hold in her sarcasm, criticism (of a little child!) and mean comments. Actually kind of pathetic. Poor Doc."
61,Dr. Heidi Woo,Los Angeles,California, Pediatricians , Female,15,3.85,2012-04-05T03:03:22Z,2,3,3,1,1,"UNPROFESSIONAL! Dr. Woo was extremely judgmental. She was rude and had this sarcastic laugh about everything I was saying. She made me feel bad about myself as a mother. She prejudged everything even before I had the chance to answer her ques. After caring for my child over the last 5 years she was treating me like an unfit mom as if I didn't have a clue to what I was doing. Even though my child is doing extremely well in all aspects of his life, healthy and happy and above avg in brain dev and social behaviors- she kept emphasizing if there was something wrong the way I was raising him. I found her way of practice to be outdated - mother-in-law way- extremely unprofessional!"

Told me to put my 1 year old daughter on a diet because she was 75th percentile for weight, not even considering my daughter is also over 100th percentile for height. I'm 5'9 and my husband is 6'5. My daughter isnt overweight at all. She just kept comparing my daughter to her daughter and of course her daughter is tiny (she is asian!) My daughter is projected to be at least 5'10. This doctor had NO clue what she was talking about. Absurd."

She was rude and condescending and had no social skills whatsoever and she obviously doesn't give a damn about her patients because when I took my daughter to her she treated her more like a medical experiment instead of a human being. No compassion at all! She is missing that emotional link to her patients which scared me the most!!! If you love your baby, do not take them to her!"

The office is wonderful and warm, the parking right outside so you'll never have to walk miles of cold corridors carrying a sick child.

Dr. Fleiss, his associates, and his staff have been the best. Kind and gentle with kids. Know my kids well. Two waiting rooms; one for sick kids. Toys & books in waiting room and exam rooms. In an old house, so feels homey and warm. They have gone out of their way many times, even allowing me to be in an exam room with my sick son for 6 hours while they tried everything they could befor sending him to hospital...they even bought me lunch! He likes vaccinations, but will allow you not to do it. Does not like circumcision, does like breast feeding, but will let you make your own decisions. I cried when I learned we had to leave because of our insurance. We have Motion Picture Industry Health Plan Blue Shield which waits more than a year to reimburse. The doctor's office couldn't put up with that and had patients submit their own reimbursement forms. They don't reimburse US either, so we have to go. :("

Getting all sorts of paperwork (e.g. immunization records) is a breeze. Sometimes we have to call Dr. Burstein's office for urgent or emergent appointments. Yes, often we'd come in and the office is full of patients. And, yes, we have to wait for the doctor to get done with her earlier patients before our kids. We know that once it is our turn, she will take just as much time and just as much care with our children. Strongly disagree with complaints posted above. Dr. Burstein took care of our kids throughout all sorts of emergencies, hospitalizations, and once an ICU admission. We feel truly fortunate that she is our doctor.

I actually changed after my second's son birth when he was a couple of months to avoid the drive, but now that he's 11 months, I am going back because she is amazing. I never left because I didn't like her. My second son had Pyloric Stenosis at 6 weeks of life and she knew it right away and made sure Radiology saw him immediately there at Cedars Sinai, even though Radiology didn't want to. She wasn't taking no for an answer. She really made me feel comfortable and comforted me. She even let me use the phone in her personal office to call my family since my cell's battery had died. For something so scary, she really made me feel great and sure about having nothing but the best Dr.s there at Cedars. I am excited to take my boys back to her and will be there late April for his 1 yr. checkup. I love the handouts she gives that apply to your child's age. She speaks great Spanish, too!!"

Cynamon,Los Angeles,California, Pediatricians , Male,4,4.06,2013-10-04T18:21:57Z,2.5,3,3,1,3,"While I am sure that Dr Cynamon is a competent specialist, my experience with him has been to the contrary. He performed a stomach biopsy on my son, which required him to be under general anaesthesia, and did not find what he expected to see, yet based a life long diagnosis upon his finding of nothing. He has recently recommended an endoscopy for my son, which will also require general anaesthesia. I have called his office twice to speak to Dr Cynamon, neither time did I receive a call back. I believe it is time to seek a second opinion."

She introduced herself and talked to my daughter for a bit so she would feel comfortable before examining her.

My children adore and idolize him. He has so many years of experience that he usually knows what's going on with my kids before I even finish my sentence. He asks all the right questions and treats my concerns with respect and medically sound advice; of course, you have to give him detailed answers to his specific questions and accurate descriptions of symptoms so that he can use the correct information to diagnose your child. He always returns my calls promptly, even after-hours - he took the time to help me find a 24-hour pharmacy near my home and called in a prescription in the wee morning hours on more than one occasion. He has great relationships with the nearby hospitals, doctors, and staff and communicates with them even before your arrival to ensure his patients receive the best care and service. He was my doctor as a child. He helped us through a very difficult month when our toddler was very ill. Years ago, when my brother was 16, he was misdiagnosed and mistreated by several doctors before my mother finally called Dr. Minassian - the only person she rightfully trusted. Dr. Minassian was able to correctly diagnose my brother with a leaking appendix over the phone, and contacted the right people to get him into an emergency surgery. Within a couple hours. Dr. Minassian saved his life. Now, as a mother, I can't imagine taking my kids to anyone else. "

We had a lot of questions about vaccines, but ultimately decided on vaccinating. We were OK with her and selected her as our daughter's primary care physician. We didn't see Dr. Pang again until after the birth while we were in the hospital. I was suffering from horrible post partpartum depression and when the nurses called Dr. Pang in because I was afraid to give my baby to the nurse for a checkup Dr. Pang suggested that I find another pediatrician because I was refusing care and that our decision not to vaccinate didn't fit the practice. HELLO!? I wasn't refusing care! I was asking questions! And who said I wasn't vaccinating?! I just asked questions, very reasonable questions and for her advice. I have NEVER had a doctor suggest we find other care. We were at our greatest need while in the hospital I was confused and TERRIFIED only to have this judgmental and arrogant woman suggest we go elsewhere with our ""concerns"" was horrid."

ALWAYS very late, not just a little late; not really listening to what her patient is saying or feeling or her parents! Childhood diabetes is so much more than readings and stats! They need to be able to feel they can vent their frustrations and get the feeling about this unbelievably difficult disease to deal with - especially for a young child/preteen! No beside manner - always seemed irritated with troubles or questions presented to her! Knowledgable - yes, absolutely....but there is so much more than that which make for a good doctor/patient relationship..."

I was Dr. Fisher's patient when I was a kid for many years (I am 22 now and no longer with her). I agree that she is a very busy lady and runs late on her appointment. HOWEVER, she is an amazing doctor with so much knowledge! She seems to really care about her patients. Yes, she seems overloaded with patients, but her whole endocrinology team will do the best to give you the best treatment for your diabetes, or what may have you. I would recommend her."

Dr. Fisher is extremely busy and is always in a rush and rarely on time. She often is distracted and doesn't listen very well. She's unavailable in emergencies, and doesn't respond to messages or emails when contacted in a timely manner. Refill approval for medications are slow and often take nearly two weeks to be approved. Her schedule is so books that it's impossible to get appointments within a reasonable amount of time. She's typically out of town or out of the country. She doesn't provide through medical care, rarely running blood panels to monitor effects of medications. Her diagnosis of the type of disorder my daughter has was flat out wrong as well and she lacks knowledge of the disorder in general. For being one of the best in the field she has not proven to be very good for my daughter."

Not only is she fantastic as a physician, but she took time to interact with my child. You can tell that she genuinely likes kids, whereas with other doctors, the interaction can be very dry. She also spoke with me in detail about my child's condition, to make sure I was informed. She's the best!"

While his views are much more mainstream than my own (pro-vax, pro-intervention) I have always found him to be respectful of my views and willing to listen to what I have to say. What I appreciate most about him is his willingness to learn something - when I pointed out to him that the handout being distributed at the 1yr well-baby check contained erroneous information about carseat safety and provided him with supporting documents from the AMA, he started giving the parents of his patients more accurate information. That's the kind of thing I REALLY appreciate in a doctor. My kids both adore Dr. Kesler and he seems to genuinely like children and like helping them. Over the past few years, I have come to trust him deeply - and as protective as I am of my children, that is saying a LOT. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Dr. Kesler to anyone."

She'll treat your kids if they have a common illness that's treatable, but our daughter had a complicated health issue & we were relying on Dr. Fisher to help us coordinate her care & wow were we disappointed. She told us to just follow what the specialists said, even when they contradicted each other. I know she comes across as very outgoing, but when we pushed her for help & she became defensive & rude. Honestly, we felt she wasn't interested in anything we had to say & was always rushing us out of the office. My theory is that she felt guilty she missed our kid's diagnosis for 4-1/2 years, so she didn't want to deal with us. And yes, after all these years, the staff is RUDE RUDE RUDE."

She was in her lobby talking with another couple and pulled us into her office afterwards to talk to us. Love her outgoing personality, but the front office was not as outgoing. Really at a crossroads. Her personality is A+, her education is tops along with her knowledge, but from the reviews on here and other places has me second guessing as of now. I think a front office set's the tone for the rest of the place. One big plus is Free Parking and location. I will have to sleep on this for a bit..."

Unfortunatly the originl doctor left the practice and there are new drs. there.Icalled about my daughter who was suffering from an earache at 4:30 I was told that they would not see her, because they ""wanted to go home to their families"". IT WAS 4:30!!! I want those bankers hours! The time before when I went to this dr. she stood in the main office railing on the top of her voice about a parent that had called in the night before. It was so unprofessional. I am looking for another doctor because I feel that if something happens again, these drs. will not be there for my daughter. They open at 9 and don't take patients after 4:30?????What is that about?Who keeps those kind of hours...does your family?"

We had a visit as his office because my daughter had a cold. If you have no insurance, he only takes cash or check and charges so much for one visit. His staff are very unprofessional. He asked for lab job to be done for my daughter. I refused the lab work. An hour after our visit his secretary dumb as dirt, calls to get my credit card # for the lap job. I told her, listen, no LAB job. The antibiotic he recommended for my daughter was the worst. It was very strong and made her sick. Today, I just received a bill for the Lab. I called his office and his staff, very unprofessional. It seems like when they are taking your money and run with it, they are nice to you. When I asked about a lap bill, she said let me connect you with the daughter. I spoke to the senile senior Doc. he couldn't remember of course because he looks like he's 100 years old and has Alzheimer's I do not recommend this old Doc to anyone!!"

They have been taking care of my two year old since day 2. He does not rush. He takes time to see how the parents are doing( which is why you wait a bit more, but is worth the wait).

I initially liked that Dr. Koursh was direct with his opinions about caring for children but as my confidence as a parent grew his condescending and arrogant tone began to really bother me. He asked the same questions during each checkup-feeling more like and oral exam rather than an exchange between a doctor and parents. He has ONE method for parents to follow and if you deviate from it at all he delivers a vague threat of causing our child trauma ""later."" For example: WE REFUSE to let our child cry-it out or night wean. We have respectfully stated this and yet he still persists claiming that we will eventually tire of it. (He speaks to us as if this decision was a trend.) He can't respect even the subtle deviations from his working model. He was also MUCH more of a lecturer when my husband was not with with me on visits. He smiles a lot but this guy lacks respect for any opinion other than his own."

Most times, I had to wait 20+ minutes after my appointment time. She might be a knowledgeable doctor, I don't know, but half of being a doctor is helping a patient not only get better, but feel better. She basically told me I was focusing too much on the thing I took my toddler in to see her for, that she doesn't see what I'm seeing and that there was nothing to worry about. She probably felt like I was wasting her time, well, I kind of walked away feeling like I just wasted mine."

She has chronic pain and can not keep up with classmates. My son 15 and a half has staring episodes. We went to Dr. Hanson because we needed follow up our insurance would cover. Dr. Hanson reported my son's episodes so that he can not get a drivers license and prescribed a psychotropic drug for my daughter as she insisted that there was nothing wrong them. As we left she told me how lucky I was that my children did not have anything wrong with them. She is going to write a letter to insurance stating that there is nothing wrong with my children.

This guy does not know what is a good service. Not responsive to parents at all. I left KASIER after 17 yrs because of him.

246,Dr. Clement C. Cheung,Los Angeles,California, Pediatricians , Male,1,1.75,2014-01-24T10:36:34Z,1.8,3,1,2,1,"My 11 year old daughter and I met with Dr. Cheung 4 times in 2013. He was condescending to my daughter, addressing her as you would a five year old. He kept on interrupting me to ask if my daughter understood some medical terminology and certain vocabulary words I was using. All that would have been tolerated but he was completely incompetent in his handling of her case. He wanted to order STIM tests and x-rays that we had completed and we had given him. It seemed like we had to explain everything to him each time we visited. I don't think he even looked at her file at all/ When I questioned his knowledge of her case, he blamed the computer system. He was also completely unresponsive via emails and phone. We waited for over an hour to see him on our last visit. Again, he gave us incorrect information about our daughter. We are in the process of filing a complaint against this doctor. A FRUSTRATING WASTE OF AN ENTIRE YEAR OF MY CHILD'S LIFE, still no answer re her condition"

She should not be practicing medicine at White Memorial Hospital, it being a teaching hospital especially with kids or anyone for that matter. My son is a special needs child and eventhough I clearly have told her a couple of times what his disabilities are she continued to belittle us and ignore them. I am definitely swithching endocronologist."

She was extremely uncouth and talked down to me and my child never wanted to see her again! We loved Dr. Borut who was retiring. I believe Amy Vedin should not be practicing around little children. She definitely doesn't listen to her patients or the parents. It's a shame she is being paid to work around little innocent children that have to take her abuse.

265,Dr. Rudo Benjamin,Los Angeles,California, Pediatricians , Male,1,1,2016-01-18T04:04:53.176Z,1,1,1,1,1,"My mother was admitted at Little Company of Mary on April 4th of this year 2014 due to electrolyte imbalance, high ammonia level and petechiae.
During her stay and under the care of Dr. Rudo Benjamin, Carl Feld and David Scott at LCM my mother was severely edematous, was having kidney failure and was having a hard time breathing. Seeing her condition worsening, I requested for her to be released from LCM.
Unfortunately the only way for my mother to be transported to my house was through hospice and I had no choice but to enroll her through Trinity Hospice.
Based on test results that I was able to obtain after my mother's death, I learned my mother was administer vancomycin at toxic levels. Based on what I read, one of the side effects of vancomycin in the elderly is decreased or closing of renal function and that is exactly what was happening to my mother. This information was never related to me on her release or thereafter. Had I been notified of this, I would have had the opportunity to take her to another hospital.
I still do not know what bacterial infection they were treating because based on her both blood culture test came back negative.
During her care through Trinity Hospice, I requested a blood test to see how her electrolyte and ammonia levels were. The hospice doctor refused to authorize the blood test and would only authorize if I paid for it. Payment for me was the never the issue. She gave me the prescription but did not provide the services. My mother was bed-bound, so attempting the process of getting this service was not easy. Unfortunately, I was never able to get this done because my mother's condition worsened and she passed away.
It is my believe that under LCM and Trinity Hospice's care contributed to my mother's death."
