Throughout my years I have been to at least 10 different doctors in all the different places that I have lived. Dr Massoudi is by far the most artistically skilled restylane/juvederm injector I have found. It is like magic what he can do for my under eye bags with less then 1cc, least expensive eye lift ever! He and all of his staff are incredibly warm and kind. I have found that an indicator of a good doctor is how happy, healthy and friendly their staff are. They all make for such a pleasant experience. I just had him do fraxel to my face today and am positive the results will be just as fantastic as everything else he has done for me. --I am posting this review on a few different sites because he deserves a good word and I am too lazy to write numerous ones:)"

She always rushed through my visit and did not take the time to listen to me very much, and also spent time reprimanding staff while I was present in the room which was uncomfortable. As a doctor she does have a great bedside manner but her lack of attention combined with the terrible office visits made me switch doctors. "

When visting her you will wait for three hours or more, and if you complain her receptionist will get an attitude and even become rude. If you call on the phone, you will be placed on hold and then hung up on. Her staff are representing her, and if they are rude and nasty, then that makes her look bad. I sould suggest to anyone reading this, llease find yourself another doctor, because you will be disappointed, and you will wait everytime you have an appointment. "

I don't mind driving up from Long Beach (and the 405 traffic) to see her. She is very caring and diligent and she has a good energy about her; a brightness to her personality.

She makes you feel so at ease when you meet her; it's as though she's been looking forward to seeing you since the day after your last physical! She's definitely an expert in gynecology (she used to work as an OBGYN, delivering babies). I trust her completely. The only negative is that she's rarely on time, but that may also have something to do with her patients not being on time and throwing off her whole schedule for the day."

Weeks later, I got charged $115+ when this is 100% covered by my insurance. Spoke with one of Dr. Kieu's business managers, Norma, in regards to fixing/resolving this billing issue - Norma was completely unhelpful, spoke to me in a condescending tone and wouldn't lift a finger to help. I had called their office over 8 times and sent over 5 UCLA internal emails to staff in getting this resolved for 3+ months. Never getting any response or resolution for those 3 months! I have already warned my friends NOT to use this doctor (she does not have good bedside manners and was even walking out the door as I was asking her questions - You're a doctor...you are supposed to be there to help your patients!!!!) and would strongly urge others looking for a PCP to reconsider and find someone else!"

Any other follow-up needs must go through her assistant who is perennially overwhelmed and overworked, thus inefficient. The staff is likewise choaotic turning over regularly except for the nurses who, fortunately, are very good if not a little chatty. The IV rooms are more like a coffee clatch than a place of serenity and healing. Basically, it costs a fortune to see this doctor and the office is a madhouse with ONE bathroom (always filthy) to serve 3 doctors, a double digit staff and all the clients! For this kind of money you would at least expect crack personnel and sufficient toilets! Good luck, I hope you're rich..."

Dr. Gisler was a very nice person, but as a professional medical office where time was crucial in my care I had NEVER seen anything so mismanaged . After spending over $2500 in a 4 week time frame, they had messed up my lab work not once not twice but 3 times. And the final time I came to have my blood RE-drawn I was sitting with an ice pack on it at the office because it was so bruised and swollen due to the incompetent way it was drawn. Other than 1 urine test, I had still not gotten ANY results back after 4 weeks. I wanted to be reimbursed for the entire amount of monies because of all the trauma they had put me through, the fact that I still did not know exactly what my blood was reading (when time was so important for my care) after 4 weeks, but they refused because they said it was there policy not to reimburse for services rendered! I just shook my had. This is not services rendered"

They bill insurance for nothing. If she ever had a firm footing and understanding of western medicine, she has either mostly forgotten that, or just decided to focus on the mystical and athroposophical ""medicine"" and let this OD/Family practice side of her training rot. If you are looking for a good/smart MD/OD firmly grounded in Western medicine(Dr Weil type), but highly open and understanding of alternatives .... she is NOT that. She is ""fluffy"", disorganized, scattered, lacks focus, takes bad notes, and doesn't build her knowledge on the pre-visit forms that are filled out. Fundamentally she doesn't understand the multi-dimensional aspects of patients from a scientific/western approach at all. She very quickly gets to the supplements and $$$ that are available in the clinic to be sold/purchased. But she is ""nice""!"

Dr. Shahin is one of the best I've ever met. He knows what he is doing, more than any other doctor I've met which is what I have no reservations traveling from the San Fernando Valley to see him. If you expect him to be on time for every appointment and he isn't, well that's just because he may be dealing with emergency or someone in dire straights. If he berates you because you're not taking care of yourself..., understand it is just more difficult for any physician to care for you if you don't take care of yourself. But when you need a healer..., Dr. Shahin is the man. This is what it is about. Getting fixed..., getting well."

I feel as if he is more of a middle man than a doctor. In other words, he prints out all these other doctors for you to see for problems you may or may not have. He is aggresive in the sense of making sure your all around healthy, but then he doesn't handle the situations, he sends you off to other doctors...all the time. I personally need a doctor who is going to handle any problems and be my doctor. There is always circumstances where you may need to see a specialist, but he is much to quick to send you off. This is not a comfortinf feeling that I hoped for from a doctor."

He spent less than 10 minutes, and the nurses did the rest.After 3-4 appointments with doctor Forman I changed doctors and am extremely happy with the transition."

She listened to me, asked many follow-up questions and didn't seem rushed to get me out the door. I had asked my previous doctor for bloodwork since I was concerned about my hormone levels or perhaps a deficiency attributing to my chronic fatigue, insomnia and mood swings but it was so difficult to get that. When I asked Jabeen if I could get that done she immediately agreed and sent me over to her phlebotomist within the office, so I didn't have to drive anywhere or make another appointment for that, it was just done. I also found it interesting in her patient forms that she asks a lot of questions about mental health, which I have rarely seen, so I applaud that as well since normally it's hard for people to feel comfortable bringing issues like that up."

He cured my mom when she was very ill that she could barely walk. His medicines just brought her back to life. Other doctors couldn't find her illness and he was the first one to give the right diagnosis and the right medicine that everyone was surprised to see her again very bright and healthy. He is one in a million doctors that does this miracle. He is the best doctor I've ever known and wishes that all my friends and family's go to him for treatment and get the best treatment ever.

I had a somewhat mysterious illness involving my liver, and Dr. Madan worked with me to figure out what was causing it. Besides being a nice person, Dr. Madan really took an interest in my illness, ordering a variety of tests that revealed the problem. I felt that sense of being a team, that together we would solve my illness. The last couple of doctor's I've seen have been smart but mildly disinterested and kind of imperious. It's great to find a doctor who is both competent and engaged. I highly recommend Dr. Madan!"

Since I had just recently moved to California I was a bit worried about finding a good doctor I felt comfortable with, since I had been seeing the same doctor in my home town for just about all my life. Dr. Boska is very knowledgeable and seems to know exactly what is wrong and always having a solution for the problem. Besides his excellent medical knowledge. Dr. Boska is a people person. Different from the average cold/noncaring doctors you seem to find. Long story short Dr. Boska actually cares about his patients, whether that be medically or just how his patient is doing in their everyday life. Its not about a pay check for this doctor. He is a doctor because he cares. Quick note soccer players play soccer because they love to play soccer, it brings them some sort of joy. The same goes for Dr. Boska he is a doctor because he loves to help people, it brings him joy. Well, that is probably enough. Lastly, thank you doc!"

I selected her as a primary care physician on my Blue Shield PPO as she had specialties in both family practice and dermatology (important as I have a prior history of skin cancer). She and her assistant both provided a comprehensive physical exam and identified a suspicious skin lesion which proved to be a small basal cell cancer. Cannot recommend a physician more highly.

BUT, as with many doctors these days, the staff is the WORST. When you call for an appt, they don't ask why you need to see her, they just tell you it will be at least a month. And, unfortunately, she moved to Cedars Sinai and joined a group of doctors. Parking is awful if you're in a hurry or running late and park in the hospital lot, it's expensive. Waiting room is always full. I finally changed doctors just because of her location and staff. Too bad!"

The technician who draws blood expected me to wait until there were at least 2 or 3 others who needed the same. When I said that I couldn't wait
and he was told to draw my blood right away he was not very professional about it. As he was drawing blood I complained that it hurt, he chastised me and then gripped my arm so hard that there were bruises on my arm the next day. I took picture (and still have them as proof).
When I went in a week later for my test results I was in the waiting room with only one other person. We were chatting about how crowded it was the week before and his office manager demanded we stop talking. We continued talking about other things and she threatened to throw me out of the office. I honestly felt like the staff were prejudice against white people.
I immediately changed my primary care physician and filed a complaint with my insurance company.
Add to that, when I went to see my new doctor for the same problem the next year, he told me that Dr. Pierson mis-diagnosed the symptoms."

She told me doctor Pierson wasn't even in the building and that once of his assistants was going to see me, but she didn't have any idea when I would see the doctor. I waited another 15 minutes and left because I had to go back to work. I can't rate the Knowledge of this Doctor because he wasn't even there. And I can't rate his assistant because they never were able to see me even though I waited for an hour and fifteen minutes after my scheduled appointment time.

The wait times, even with an appointment are horrendous, the staff never seem to answer the phones, and I was even forced to call my insurance company as the staff was unable to verify my insurance and tried to get me to pay $400 out of pocket just to see the doctor for a check up.

However, dealing with the staff in this office is a nightmare. The staff negates any good things I could say about this doctor. This office can not be utilized as a primary care physician under insurance because of the total incompetence of the staff. The staff ignores all phone messages thus never returning any calls, place you on hold for lengthy times or not answer. Relying upon this office to obtain referrals is virtually impossible. I literally limped into this office over 3 months ago. Finally went for an MRI that I had to arrange directly through my insurance and found that I have a torn meniscus. Now, three months later, I still have no referral to an orthopedic doctor so renin in pain. Have never waited less than 3 hours and then hardly ever get to actually see the doctor personally. Nurse practitioner prescribes medicine but if a refill is needed, that Nurse Practitioner can't be found. Bottom line . . . Stay away."

I was told that the $150.00 will cover all my medical expenses. Mrs. Devgan Ganged-up with her Husband Mr. Devgan (Dermatologist Surgeon)to claim that i needed surgery for a small boil, and proceeded to charge me $700.00 for scam surgery. I caught on their SCAM and requested a refund of my $150.00, which they refused to give me. At that point, i knew i had been SCAMMED!They both immediately asked me if i wanted some antibiotics from their pharmacy to remedy the situation. I refused antibiotics, and adamantly requested for a full refund. Mrs Devgan then said she will write me a prescription of strong antibiotics to use for infection. They took me into an old cluttered and filthy room for SCAM examination (which took less than 20 seconds). Both doctors were very unprofessional. condescending, and damn right rude and horrible. I filed a formal complaint to the ""Ame Acad of Dermat"". Run from both Doctors"

Every time I see him, he is just a treat. When you talk to him you can tell he is deep in thought and digesting every word - especially with his approving ""mmhmms"" and ""yups!"", you can tell he just gets it.
My kids love him because he connects with them in a way that I could never do - he knows all about the hottest candies and children's TV shows - I don't know how he does it! I must admit that while my little one's love him - my wife refuses to go. I don't know what he problem is, she says that he's never available for her, giving excuses like ""he was at the crasino"" or ""he told me he was going for a long lunch at Del Gringos"". In my experience I've never ran into these problems, I think she's just being a dingus.
Over all I think Dr. Steve is fantastic and can't recommend him enough - I always immediately feel better when leaving his office because I know I'm in good hands.
For your health,

I've seen a doctor only twice in over a decade, and one of those times was for a physical, also by Dr. Hahn, where he incorrectly diagnosed a mole that he said needed to be removed in a follow-up. It was a scab, not a mole, as I pointed out in the first visit but he ignored me. I canceled the follow-up when the scab fell off. As I said, I do not see doctors unless I have a serious concern. Today was one of those serious times (apnea & cough). The junior doctor took me seriously, but Dr. Hahn did not take my concerns seriously at all. The first thing Hahn asked was about the mole from the previous visit, and was surprised to find that there was no mole. Then he said multiple times, ""Looks like you've got a case of the miseries,"" and he also kept asking, ""Are you going to survive?"" This was completely unprofessional behavior and I will never go to this practitioner again, if I ever do need to see a doctor again in the next ten years."

What offended me most is during a pelvic exam I yelled that what she was doing was painful and she didn't stop, but kept going further! I had to physically pull my hips away. NOT GOOD.

She began speaking to my wife very slowly, as if teaching English to a dog or a cat. Not the most intuitive approach considerably beyond what I was expecting. I mentioned that although I occasionally log on to the Kaiser website, my wife does not use a computer and would like to continue receiving written test results by mail.

I just needed a simple prescription refill and she said it was done when I was in the office. Only a week later that a nurse called and she decided not to do it. Just FYI this was not for any kind of controlled substance- it's just what I use to keep my Autoimmune disease in remission so it's pretty important. She had the nurse tell me to see my specialist which takes three weeks to get an appointment and is unnecessary. My regular internist always filled my prescriptions but he moved so sadly I made the mistake of seeing this terrible uncaring doctor who did not seem at all on the ball and clearly has no concern for her patients.

He gave me some prescriptions for I don't know what (he said, ""take motrin for (and the rest was inaudible), and ordered blood tests also for unknown reasons. I left knowing as much as i did going in there. Well, except that I now know I won't be going back. This doctor SEVERELY LACKS COMMUNICATION SKILLS!!!! Please note, this was my initial visit, and I do not know if he's any friendlier when you've visited more than once, but my first visit was enough for me to know that I did not want him to be my doctor.

My insurance company assigned his practice to me, I didn't have a choice! My presence seemed to upset him. Sorry! He became irritated that I would have a question about less expensive medication. Even if his pharmacy that he does business with doesn't carry the medication, he could have still politely talked with me and tried to answer my question instead of rudely snapping at me and then ignoring me.

They work very hard to help the patients and never gossip. The majority of the patients are senior members, and they need more attention from the doctor and the office staffs. In my experiences, they don't need you make an appointment to visit and try their best to help. I visited the office because I could not see my previous family doctor due to the appointment issue. Because I had an emergency problem, I could not wait and I rushed to Dr. Pan office for help. Since then, I became his patient. And my parents and the whole family are his patients now. I know his office very well, and they follow the sign in sheet order for calling the patients. They will see you first only if they find out you have an emergency problems. I definitely support this office. I think the last one writing the comments is not the real patient. It is definitely not."

After waiting more than 30 minutes in the waiting room and 45 minutes in the patient room, I asked him about serious neck strain and a lipoma I have near my shoulder/neck area and asked if he knew what may be causing the pain and the return of a lipoma and he pointed up to the ceiling. I was confused and asked what he meant and he explained that only God knows the reason. His daughter was the front desk staff at the time (probably may still be) and she is as rude and unprofessional as they come. The nice people I recall were the nurse by the name of Xiomara and an older woman with glasses who handles the billing. After several negative encounters, I was forced to file a grievance. I stopped going to the doctor to avoid the callousness and negative vibe and for lack of time to find a new qualified Dr. I'm overdue for a physical so here I find myself researching new doctors and I came across his name and I just had to share my terrible experience."

He and his staff are warm, friendly, and do everything possible to accommodate his patients' needs. He is one of the few doctors left who actually take the time to *listen* to his patients, and he cares for the patient as a whole person as opposed to just a collection of symptoms.

Sometimes she's thorough and sometimes she appears to be too busy, frazzled and/or rushed which may explain at times her lack of thoroughness and/or assumptions in her patients. She's a nice lady but her lack of thoroughness due to her rushed schedule can be dangerous to a patients health. This doctor also takes on the responsibility of performing her female patients pelvic exams and pap smears which is a no no for a general doctor to do. General doctors eyes are not trained to detect problems in women's female reproductive organs. My mom went to her and Dr. Kienle told my mom that during the exam that her uterus looked a little larger than usual but everything looked normal. Approximately two years later my mom was diagnosed with advanced stage 3 uterus cancer. Look up stats on stage 3 cancer. Mom, rest in peace. "

I had weight gain, hair loss, and severe fatigue. Most of my immediate family has hypothyroidism and I was always borderline but had not been tested for a while, so I suspected that might be it. First, faulty results were drawn(that truly made no sense b/c nothing showed up as normal) , but I had to email her a month later to hear anything back. She then responded that it was actually HYPERthyroidism, which I honestly couldn't imagine. I felt like I had to force her for more blood work. Sure enough, I was way off the charts and had hypothyroidism. It took me forever to actually get started on treatment, and, as my thyroid function dropped dangerously low, I felt like an annoyance to her the whole time. She does not fight for her patients' health, that's for sure."

I have been a patient of hers for 3 years and have been repeatedly unsatisfied with her approach to my questions and concerns. If you are under the age of 30, APPEAR able-bodied, she undermines your complaints/symptoms, tells you ""good luck"" and sends you on your way. My last visit with her I expressed worry about excessive night sweats, trouble breathing, frequent light headedness, and overall fatigue. With a half smile, she ordered a few blood tests and sent me on my way yet again. My tests revealed low RBC's, elevated billirubin and still she neither emailed me nor informed me about my concerning results. Instead, I had to email her and notify her about my lab results and asked her what they indicated. She replied with a one sentence email with neither answers nor concerns. Overall, she lacks the intuition and knowledge of a practicing doctor as well as the empathy to connect with patients. I would not recommend Dr. Kienle to anyone."

Not life threatening prescriptions but quality of life prescriptions. She has been there a long time and runs the show and nothing can be done about it.

At the orthopedist, I learned that I had a massive herniated disc and needed surgery to avoid permanent neurological damage. If I had listened to Dr. Holt and had not gotten a second opinion, I would be permanently disabled."

When I contracted a permanent but non life threatening disease,he laughed it off and said I was lucky. He said he had to tell patients almost every day they were going to die.

Most of the time he tells us we're doing fine and not too worry, doesn't really order tests unless we ask. He's ok if you don't mind a low maintenance doctor, but we generally worry about things now that we are getting older and would prefer more detailed analysis of our problems.

He clearly doesn't know what he's talking about. He also said if food tastes good don't eat it but he's over weight himself. He just wants to get people in and out of the office as fast as possible.

I also explained that I'm open about my sex life and want control over my own body but it's also because of my cramps and after fighting it for a good 10 minutes, she started writing a prescription and before she did, she looked at me and said ""Does your mother know about your plans?""....

Absolutely filthy with out if date instruments. I have seen veterinarians offices in better shape. Unsanitary and unprofessional. This was at best a place of crude version of modern medicine. Pushy nurses. Terrible bedside manner. While the very aged and somewhat confused dr is hidden in the back room. I would not even go here to be treated for a paper cut. Don't go here. There is better doctors out there. Do your research.

He ignores his patients cries for help. And I am talking about a ninety year old woman who is in pain and suicidal. For one year he has let her languish in hell. She is paralyzed and feels like a prisoner in her body. He gave her pain medication that only makes her more fearful and agitated. He can not be reached by telephone. There are no services where by one can leave a message. He does not visit his patients or take any personal interest. I can't tell you the living hell this poor woman is in, under his care. And care is just not the proper word. I am horrified. And can no longer sit by and watch this process. I will contact the AMA. I don't know how these characters keep a license."

She is always in a rush. She and her nurse are not warm or compassionate- although they are in a ""caring"" business and working with ailing patients.

When I got there only a Resident who couldn't prescribe me my medicine was there. I came back one week after to see the doctor on Staff Dr. Meas was not attentive to my needs. She was quick to throw me under the bus. I can tell with her eyes she judged me and was quick to refer me to someone else. I came in there with a cold that she wouldn't even treat me for. The was rude and very uncomfortable to talk to. She listened and had no feedback other than I can send you to a specialist. This kind of doctor shouldn't even practice. WASTE of time. I coughed all night and had runny nose and all she said is ""I can't prescribe on the first visit."" She took my money and was quick to leave the room. Horrible uncomfortable experience.

She proceded to describe to me the RHYTHM METHOD. ""It's hard to get pregnant. Just use condoms 5 days a month, and you'll be fine!"" When I told her that that sounded really really risky, she said: ""Oh, no. It's safe. BUT, if you get pregnant, then you'll have a beautiful gift from God! Right?"" WRONG. Check please. She was totally out of touch. I asked her about the Nueva Ring and she thought I was talking about a diaphram. I was shocked that she could be so careless with something that has such gigantic consequences. Then, I went downstairs to the pharmacy and her staff tried to give me somebody else's medicine.

There is absolutely NO follow up - I was told to call 1 week after epidural to let them know how I was- I told office person (will not name) that NO RESULTS & to have the doctor call me.

Initial referal appointment scheduled quickly & easily but then:
- Dr. Ornelas asked about my problem but cut me off almost immediately and said I needed an MRI and then another test.
- I explained that the pain makes it impossible to lay flat and inquired about a standup MRI. He said there was no such thing and dismissively/mockingly pressured me into scheduling a traditional MRI.
- Traditional MRI was predictably a disaster with me screaming in pain two minutes into it. (The Keck MRI technicians seemed amazed not only that Dr. Ornelas would schedule something that wouldn’t work but also that he hadn’t offered me a sedative for the procedure or otherwise prepped me in any way.)
- I sent articles to Ornelas's office about standup MRIs (they absolutely exist) and, after several weeks of his being completely unavailable at ""conferences"" he finally deigned to respond that standup would work fine ""with approval"".
- Five voicemails and 10 emails to his designated communicator BRENDA RAMOS have gone completely unanswered. That woman has caused me immeasurable pain & suffering. She needs to be fired immediately and I may have cause for legal action (exploring).
Overall, a complete disaster. Am looking now for a doctor that actually listens, knows his/her stuff, cares and has a competent reasonably responsive staff."

No other physician I have had in my 12-year battle with AIDS has made me feel so fully assured that I was in the best of hands.

If you are looking for a quack, you have found one!"

Mt appt. was at 9am, the doctor didn't see me until 11:30am. He's not even sure if his entire staff is medically certified. I told him about how the ""medical asst."" drew my blood. She stuck me sideways, and didn't seem to know what she was doing. I was referred for an ultrasound, and discovered that I had fibroids. The PA that he has working there, Dr. Hafeeza Al-Uqdah got nasty with me when over the phone, I asked her how many fibroids I had. She told me that she wasn't going to count them because she was tired. Then she hung up on me. I called her back, and she told me she was going to hang up on me again. And she did. i told Dr. Pyne about this, and he has done NOTHING about it. These doctors shouldn't even be allowed to put a BAND-AID on anyone. This is the most crass, unprofessional medical clinic that I've ever been to, and they are liars!"

In this type of profession, receptionists should not be twirling their hair, especially if they are the company's first impression. They should be courteous and polite, and not short-tempered and rude."
428,Dr. Amir H. Rad,Los Angeles,California, Family Doctors / G.P.s , Male,1,1,2015-09-04T11:53:55.505Z,1,1,1,1,1,"If I could rate him 0 stars, I would. Unfortunately, this is one of the worst doctors I have ever been to. He is arrogant and does not listen. His explanations for events and symptoms are conflicting and confusing. He is condescending in tone and content. He regularly cuts me off, impatiently holding me accountable for not understanding his poor communicative efforts. He rushes me through appointments and I rarely leave with a sense of being in competent, caring hands. But, the worst offense is that he refuses to involve himself in any dialogue or acknowledgement of heart-related symptoms he cannot explain. If I experience heart palpitations or other cardiac arrhythmias that are not reflected in my heart monitor, he shames me for “wasting his time” (a literal quote) and only begrudgingly offers suggestions of who might be able to help me instead. That’s if I’m lucky. Otherwise, I clearly have a “psychiatric issue” that needs to be examined. Right. So, if you can’t explain the symptom, the only other plausible explanation must be that I’m crazy. Ironically, he has all the traits of a bona fide Narcissist. (Note: I am not a licensed psychiatric clinician, but simply stating my personal observation.)
Continuing along these lines, he resents answering questions, feeling that simply telling me “things are fine” should make my terrifying experiences magically disappear. I have a very serious cardiac condition and I do best when armed with information and a comprehensive understanding of my situation. One time when I asked for an explanation for the difference between the cardiac condition I once had and the one it now progressed to, he said, “It would be beyond your comprehension, so I will not explain it.” More like, you must not have a very keen grasp of the situation yourself, if you cannot break it down for your patients. The man is insufferable and insulting. He creates an enormously hostile environment where I leave more taxed than when I went in. The bulk of his patients are senior citizens who do not speak English as a first language. I am comparatively articulate in English. I shudder to think what he gets away with regarding patients who may not be in a position to put forth their needs more assertively.
God willing, my insurance will cover me finding a better, more ethical electrophysiologist."

They never learn they never stop.

My father went in for a visit and forgot to request for a neurologist because he is suffering from something we are trying to figure out. It tooks a couple weeks of leaving messages and hearing the receptionist tell me that they would call me back before I was able to talk to someone directly. I have been trying to get a request for my ill father to see a neurologist and Dr. Sheibani said it would take 10 business days and to wait for a call. I never got a call and when I called 15 business days later, They said that the doctor never put in the request. Never have I known a doctors office to be so unprofessional. Terrible place."

Both the ER doctors and I had called Dr. Chung's office and DID NOT receive ANY response. Given it was Sat & the office was closed, the answering machine ask you to leave a message if there is an emergency. No call back. I told them my dad had a stroke & I had left a message. All I got was silence. I told the receptionist what info I needed for the hospital. I was told she can’t tell me. Then she asked me to call back in 5 minutes. When I called back she asked me if I have any siblings (to verify my identity). I got my answers after that. All the while she never asked about my father. Any human being, after hearing the news, “I am sorry to hear that.” or “I hope he recovers soon.” etc. They also refused to signed referrals for my mom. This office does not put the patient’s need first. They are rude and does not care for the patients as human beings."

He does multiple procedures on the insured. Why someone having cold needs Pap smear!? I just needed cold meds, but Dr. P didn't give any to me. After the initial office visit, I found out that he is practicing Fraud, and in 1991, his licence was suspended in Wisconsin. If you have Good insurance and want to be treated as a VIP, he is the one. For the sick, find and go to some other Dr. Dr. P doesn't know how to give right treatment."
