20	May 02, 2019	4	Family Medicine	Dr. Rochelle Pondt	Houston,	159	4	On Monday April 22, 2019 I visited Vitality Family Medicine for simple vaccination: Tdap and TB skin test. Dr. Pondt suggested the blood test, stating it only takes 2-3 days for results and its more accurate. I've worked in healthcare for 10+ years and prefer the skin test which is what I received. I left the clinic with no information besides a sheet of paper showing proof of my tdap vaccine. I arrived on back to have my skin test read on 4/24/2019 around 1 pm. Dr. Pondt refused to verify my TB test stating it couldnt be read until 3:59 pm or later. I was shocked as there were no written directions that my test had to be read exactly at 48 hours. I wasnt able to return that day and showed up 4/25/2019 now to be told i was outside the 72 hour window. I then was offered the TB blood test which they suggested saved me time and would be ready in 2-3 days. On 5/1/2019 (3 days later) I reached out to the office who should have contacted me now to hear the results will take another 6 days.  	4	10 – 15 minutes	TX	1	4.6	4

83	Oct 28, 2018	4	Family Medicine	Dr. Bita Pour-Jafari	Houston,	85	5	Never felt comfortable with her in three years. Most times she hadn't checked test results before visits. Had insurance to send her papers once for info and they never heard back. She never contacted people back. It was horrible trying to refill prescriptions because she (or her nurses) never contacted the Pharmacy back.

This doctor is contracted as a PCP provider and as a PCP provider you are responsible for submitting referrals to specialists for the ongoing healthcare of the patient.  Dr. Uddin dropped the ball not just once but twice.  His staff is constantly turning over and they are not equipped to provide patient care!  He uses his medical assistant as his referral submitter; therefore,  she cannot get to her referrals until after clinic which leaves a small window of time to process a few referrals a day!  If your referral entails some extra leg work you can forget about getting it processed and he is likely to dismiss you as a patient for taking up more time than they want to give you!  Because of their lack of detail needed for my surgery the referral was not submitted timely in May.

220	Mar 23, 2017	3	Internal Medicine	Dr. Sandhya Mokkala	Houston,	14	4	Call office and hard to speak even to medical assistant. You can totally forget the dr.calling you or even speaking to you on the phone even when you tell medical assistant you feel it's important. My problem was a Blood Pressure problem and each time new medicine added was the answer. None taken away but just another added on top of those already given. Dr. does not seem to listen to patients and that is a sad situation. Seems to be just get them in and out.	3	10 – 15 minutes	TX	1	3.3	3
221	Mar 19, 2016	3	Internal Medicine	Dr. Sandhya Mokkala	Houston,	14	4	Dr. Mokkala is a very concerned and caring doctor.  She spends a lot of time with the patient and listens to all concerns.  If she feels that the patient needs a specialist she will promptly refer that patient to the specialist for the particular problem.  She is very concerned if the patient is having any side effects of a particular medication and will quickly either remove the medication or try another medication in its place.  Dr. Mokkala's nurse is very friendly and efficient.	3	10 – 15 minutes	TX	5	3.3	3
