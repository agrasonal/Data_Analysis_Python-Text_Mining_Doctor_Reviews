His initial bedside manor was unconventional, and once I got to know him better I understood it was his way to break the ""Am I going to die"" mood. Megan, his PA, balances him out. Great team."

The sparkle in his eyes as he speaks to you shows how much he loves his work. In a crisis during recovery because my body did not respond well, he stepped in and made the best decision to relieve my panic. He is my doctor forever - and I hope he can stay around long enough get me to 100!

I recently had my fourth procedure to add stents to clogged arteries. I must say this last time was the most difficult that I have ever had. . She knew it woldl likely be so she took extra measures to insure success. And it was successful as proven by me being able to write this three weeks after the procedure. Not only is she very capable in her field but she has top notch associates to refer fror anything not in her specific area of expertice.

When I scheduled my initial appointment, they entered my date of birth, phone number AND insurance card information incorrectly which I was unaware of at the time. They didn't call to remind me of my appointment because they had the wrong number. They couldn't verify my insurance until I arrived on my appointment day. And they were unable to retrieve the medical records from my other doctor because they entered my DOB incorrectly. And obviously they couldn't call me because they put the wrong number in the system!
The older lady told me that I needed to pay $200 before the doctor would see me because I had not met my deductible. She further explained that if they were to bill the insurance company, they would reject my claim because I had not met my yearly deductible. Then she tried to tell me that my appointments don't have co-pays and I am required to pay $200 towards my deductible THAT day. I immediately called my insurance company and no surprise the lady lied. The insurance company rep told me that that is how THIS office operates not MY insurance policy. I kindly told the older lady that I really wished that they would have recorded the correct details in their system because this insurance business could have been taken care of sooner. The older lady looked at me and said ""Thanks darling. Bye."" I took off of work early that day and that's how she treats me given my inconveniences were their fault.
Also, they do not listen. The front desk/older lady and the physician's assistant kept telling me that they needed to do an EKG when I already told them three times that my PCP did a EKG two weeks prior and it will be in the Memorial Hermann Group system. She kept saying ""we couldn't find it"" and ""are you sure it was an EKG."" I told them that I wasn't going to pay for it again so they need to contact my PCP for it.
When you go here, please be prepared for a total disregard of your intelligence. This lady treated me like I was a small child. She was very disrespectful and spoke to me like I had no knowledge of how insurance works. I worked in the insurance industry for two years, I know enough to know that this practice is not one that you should go to unless you want them to steal money from you and be treated less than a human. The older lady is very rude and obviously doesn't know what she is doing. "

He was both my Mother and my Fathers Doctor for many many years. I can't tell you how many times he saved my mothers life. She had many medical problems, but he always pulled her through. I am grateful for the many extra years he gave me with her. He is now my doctor. He is so thorough and always speaks to you in a way that you can understand and know what's going on. Even now, almost 20 years after my Mom and Dad has passed away, he still talks to me about them and tells me fond memories he had with them while caring for them. He always makes me smile and fell warm inside. I will never forget his kindness and caring heart. Sometimes i want to ask him his age, because he still looks the same as he did 25 years ago. I hope he never retires...."

Dr. Nasser, went out of his way to prepare a plate of food for her. It is kind service like this, that heals an illing patient, especially an 88 year old lady. His professionalism, the exceptional assistants, friendly staff, and the warmness you receive when you walk into his office, is without a doubt, the best bedside manners anyone can hope for.

He took the blood pressure himself, did the exam, sat in his rolling chair and wrote 2 new prescriptions. He never said why he was changing them from what another dr had prescribed and was working fine. Went to pharmacy and they were both extremely expensive! I called to request something with a generic and it took several days to get another prescription. Not sure what the fuss is all about. I wasn't impressed. Average at best.

He sent me directly to the hospital and put me on a medical regimen for three days. I was told that I may have to have a valve replaced and that the procedure would be more effective with open heart surgery. He needed to check the heart with a camera. I was shocked when he told me my heart was in perfect condition. It was a miracle. Dr. Delgado is a genius! There isn't anything not to like!!!

We switched our medical records from the Willowbrook office to the downtown Houston office thinking the staff would be better. Oh my goodness, it's as bad if not worse than the Willowbrook office. Husband is scheduled for surgery, and we've tried for over one week to get an okay from the doctor. Nothing has been done thus far. Terrible staff. Think admin staff my be given entirely too much authority, and they use it. If possible, would give staff a zero rating."
88,Dr. Stanley M. Duchman,Houston,Texas,Cardiologist, Male,9,4.27,2015-05-08T18:34:57.387Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Duchman was recommended to me by Dr. Lewitton. In a world of ""hurry up"" Dr.Duchman never rushed me, explains all options, and listens to all concerns. He is now my sister,mother and father's cardiologist. His NP Brittney is awesome as well. She was a life saver for my family when I had a aortic value problem right before Thanksgiving 2014. My actions speak for themselves.

Dr. Nasir's staff is the most capable I have ever seen in my 70 years. His nurse practitioner once examined me in an elevator while I was taking my wife to another doctor in the same building after I said I thought my heart rate was a little high. (She sent me for an EKG which showed an arrhythmia). Dr. Nasir has the shape and style of Luciano Pavarotti, while he may not be able to sing as well is medical skills are at that same high level."
99,Dr. Nadim Nasir,Houston,Texas,Cardiologist, Male,4,4.81,2008-10-01T16:09:05Z,4.5,4,4,5,5,I was referred to Dr Nasir personally by Dr Michael DeBakey ~2006.

We too experienced that he is arrogant, very controlling, does not at all welcome questions or review of lab work, and staff repeatedly did not provide medical records needed for another appointment to us nor to the recommended follow up doctor despite 5 pleas. Finally told, after we had our critical meeting with follow up doctor without needed reports - oh you have to go to medical records for that. Nurse behaved passive-aggressively... Truly odd experience with this doctor and staff. And yes, as other patient stated Dr. Achari will blind-side you with send letter of dismal of his services out of the blue. Does not discuss with you anything regarding his concerns to continue he just sends a certified letter and tosses you aside despite your need or current condition . Dr. Achari and nurse does not engender a warm, stable and collaborative health partnership with his patient, rather master - subject relationship. Only time in our 60 years have we experience such callousness and odd-abrupt end."

Even the female there does not have the bedside manner this doctor has. His expertise and compassion for patients outweigh the others. Wait time is a bit heavy but I will wait for the best. I do not wait for seconds. This doctor always apologizes if he is running late. Common courtesy.

This doctor is the most compassionate of all doctors I have seen. He understands heart disease well. There may be a wait to see him as everyone wants to see this man. Take a book...The wait is well worth it.

Unfortunately, she has the worst front office staff ever. The front desk lady is SO RUDE. The office is incredibly mismanaged and so poorly ran. I have never been there where I didn't spend at least 3 hours of my day there, the first hour just sitting in the waiting room, the second hour sitting in an exam room. At one point I was there, 6 months pregnant and they left me in an exam room for 45 minutes while they took a lunch break. They didn't tell me they were on a lunch break until they came back. They could of at least told me they were stopping for lunch so I could get food myself. I'm sorry...you scheduled this appointment. If you close for lunch, you shouldn't be scheduling appointments at lunch. If you're so far behind from your morning, you should be catching up during lunch, not stopping. Respect other people's time. No one wants to take a half day of vacation from their job, to sit in your office."

At first this bothered me, but now it's become a joke between us. He loves what he does, is excellent at it and it shows. He will explain everything in detail. I can reach him any time day or night and he returns my calls, not his staff! My insurance (HMO) didn't cover him, but he agreed to a low payment. He and his staff believe treatment is what is important. I wouldn't go to anyone else!"

He is the best in his field as far as we're concerned, and we have seen many doctors. My husband suffers from Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and has other factors that make his condition one of the rarest types of HCM. Dr. Shih is always informative and answers ANY questions that we have. If we miss an appointment, his staff doesn't call us, HE calls us!! He wants to know why we missed and then lectures us on the importance of proper follow up! LOL! And Jocelyn, his assistant, is the absolute best! She knows each patient and their spouse by name and she knows patient history w/o having to refer to a chart, even though it is available to her. There are not enough good things that I can say about Dr. Shih. We have been a patient of his for 6 years now and will follow him where ever he goes, if he decides to leave Houston. You just don't find the level of care that you receive from Dr. Shih and Jocelyn anywhere!"

They could never give me a straight answer and they didn't even have a clue as to what was wrong with me. My heart rate would jump over 300 beats a minute and i would hyperventilate as well and the doctors here would always tell me that most people would either pass out from it beating so fast, have a heart attack, a stroke or possible die, but yet they couldn't find out what was wrong with me even when they knew what could happen to me. Well one day i was referred to Dr. Hue-Teh Shih after i had an ""episode"" and i took him my EKG results and he looked at it. As soon as he looked at it, he instantly knew what was wrong with me. He explained what i had and what i needed done to correct it. He explained everything down to the t. A week later i went in for surgery and haven't had an ""episode"" since. I don't think Dr. Hue-Teh Shih wil"

I was in the hospital and had no choice of my MD. His office staff is rude and overall feeling in office is cold. His PA was dismissive of my concerns. If I had a choice I would NOT choose this MD.

I stated that he did not listen to me regarding opening up part of my chest for more thyroid in which I am still going through miserable symptoms. The truth of the matter is that there was no CT scan that pronounced the problem for him to operate in that area. My situation is very complex; and he did an extensive exploratory on the right side going up to the ear lobe where he found a whole new lobe in that area. He did perform a scan CT/PET that indicated nothing which would mean he couldn't operate unless he had a blueprint of evidence. I apologize for saying what I did and believe that if Dr McKowen would have seen hard evidence of something in the chest, he would have gone back in. He is a very skilled surgeon and very thorough for the way he executes a plan of action. Unfortunately, that surgery did not solve my major problem. Nevertheless, I appreciate what he did do."

He is a thoracic surgeon but he does thyroids and thymus gland removals as well. He was very eager and sure that he was going to explore just the right side of my thyroid area all the way up to my ear. He says that he removed a large gland from that area. However, he ignored the fact that my symptoms were coming from the sternal notch and below into the thoracic inlet area. My husband and I both asked him to explore below the notch as long as he was going up. He refused to do so. After my surgery, I had severe voice box complications and no relief in my debilitating symptoms. He refused to re explore and told me I need to seek counseling for my sensations even though a recent I131 scan indicated at least 38 percent more uptake. He was very cold and arrogant when he knew he was wrong in what he did. This is a surgeon who works to fix people's physical issues. This man has too much pride and a lack of concern for patients and their welfare."

He listens, is attentive and takes time to answer all of your questions. I had seen another cardiologist for several years and never felt secure, but felt like a number and that he wanted my $, but didn't want to spend the time to explain what was happening with my heart bundle branch block, heart rate issue and high blood pressure. I was referred to Dr. Solomon by a nurse who worked with him in the cath lab and said he was an exceptional man and dr. and I have found that to be true."
198,Dr. Stuart L. Solomon,Houston,Texas,Cardiologist, Male,4,4.81,2012-10-29T00:36:04Z,5,5,5,5,5,"EXCELLENT DOCTOR!!! CANNOT IMAGINE A MORE EXPERIENCED OR KNOWLEDGEABLE PHYSICIAN. He has the bedside manners of your next door neighbor, your friend, your physician all combined into one. Extremely kind and 30+ years of studying something as a simple pump....he understates his importance. His demeanor is warm and kind. A credit to his profession in every regard. Being over a decade under his care, I can say he is what physicians everywhere should aspire to be."
199,Dr. Stuart L. Solomon,Houston,Texas,Cardiologist, Male,4,4.81,2006-09-18T00:00:00Z,5,,5,5,5,I have been a patient of this Doctor for several years. I have recmmeded several of my friends and associates to him for good concered treatment. He always takes sufficiennt time to explain situations to your satisfaction of understanding.

If it wasn't for him my mom would not be here today. I had a stress test scheduled and was waiting on him at the office due to an emergency and it was my mom, massive heart-attack. My dad and him did not want to tell me until he got into the office and he went over everything with me with total compassion and understanding. Now I have most of my family members going to him! Best doctor!"

Once you get past the ""fast food line"" of processing incoming patients, and the horrific wait times, he didn't listen to me, and put me on a medication that made things worse, wanted me to have a test that I had already had before doing anything else. So I went to another doctor and my problem is now resolved. "
206,Dr. Vincent Aquino,Houston,Texas,Cardiologist, Male,8,3.31,2014-02-28T14:45:36Z,1.8,1,1,1,4,"I liked Dr. Aquino. However, as he is responsible fr his office,mi have to say I am changing to another cardiologist. The staff never keeps an appointment when scheduled with him. You have to beg for test results. Never once has an appointment not been changed at least once. Usually three times. One is never accommodated to get you in sooner. It's always ""weeks"" away. When asked why, the desk person said ""its because he has emergencies come up""! What? How can they know about emergencies in advance? Anyway, I'm done. The group is fired."

He spent quality time during examination and was extremely caring, confident, and knowledgeable. Dr. Aquino gets extra high ratings for explaining my concerns in a less esoteric fashion; in a way that I could understand! He's the best!"
209,Dr. Vincent Aquino,Houston,Texas,Cardiologist, Male,8,3.31,2009-01-12T20:20:52Z,4.8,5,4,5,5,"Dr. Aquino has the art of making you feel that you are his only patient and that you are important. His explanations are clear. The followup done by is office is to be commended. I have been his patient for approximately 10 years and when there was a delay in seeing him, there was communication and an apology given. The extra time he gave to that patient, he will also give to you, if needed."

However, his office staff is very difficult to work with, in my opinion. In February, he sent me to have a chemical stress done. I requested a report, by phone, once the results were in. I waited over a month and finally called to get the results. The person I spoke with said they had not received the results from the office that did the stress test. So I called that office. After about a week, still no call back, so I called Dr. Haas office again and finally got the test results, after about 6 weeks. Most recently, I had a visit with him a couple of weeks ago. He requested that I have an ultrasound to check the status of a carotid artery blockage. I was told by staff that they would have to get approval from my Medicare Adv provider and once that was done, would call me to make an appointment. I waited 2 weeks and finally, today, called my provider and was told that they had not received any approval request. I think this staff is very inefficient, but still, I highly recommend Dr. Haas. He has a great personality, seems to be very knowledgeable, is very responsive while not being over-reactive."
215,Dr. Philip Clay Haas,Houston,Texas,Cardiologist, Male,4,3.69,2011-04-11T10:07:08Z,4,3,3,5,5,Very good doctor and helpful staff. He is very knowledgeable and I have fully recovered.
216,Dr. Philip Clay Haas,Houston,Texas,Cardiologist, Male,4,3.69,2009-03-17T20:24:59Z,2.5,1,1,4,4,"First visit waited 1 hr 45 min. Second visit waited 1 hr 15 minutes before being asked to reschedule. I was given 2 excuses: he likes to take his time with patients (good practice anyway but the staff should know the approximate time he takes to avoid over bookings) & all the doctors were in that day with a limited number of examining rooms (staff should know that when booking appointments). Others in the waiting room indicated long waits were not uncommon. If they can call 3 times to remind one of appointments, why can’t they call before the appointment to say he is running late? Is business so good that his team doesn’t care nor respect patients’ time, is that the dr you want to do business with? I found his team to be disorganized. Unfortunate because in my one visit, I found him to be caring, interested & thorough. I found me another cardiologist as I don't need to deal with someone whose staff doesn't care or is not competent."

If you want a doctor that truly cares for your well being then he is the one you should see. He would even make an effort to call you himself if you try to reach him after hours. "

223,Dr. Sayed F. Feghali,Houston,Texas,Cardiologist, Male,4,3.63,2011-12-01T10:38:04Z,4.5,4,4,5,5,"My wait in Dr Feghali's office was long but no longer than most doctors, plus I had several tests. The best thing about Dr Feghali is that he KNEW WHO I WAS. He had reviewed my chart, lab and tests prior to walking in the room. More doctors should do this. We were able to work through my issues efficiently and he answered all of my questions."
224,Dr. Sayed F. Feghali,Houston,Texas,Cardiologist, Male,4,3.63,2011-03-21T21:22:36Z,2,2,2,2,2,"During the visit, Dr. Feghali did not bring up lipid levels, weight control, or other pertinent issues. I had to suggest changes in medication regime. After major tests were performed, the nurse called to say ""everything is OK,"" in spite of wild arrythmias during the testing, I asked to speak to the doctor.When he called he would not answer my questions about the testing, how it was interpreted, how my experience didn't square with the report. He had not followed up on important adjunct testing from my internist. He cut me off after 3 minutes, and REFUSED to call me again. When I was having chest pain, it took me two weeks to get an appointment, and several days to get a return call from his staff. However, the staff called FIVE times the day before testing about financial arrangements. Even a phone call from my internist, attempting to get more information, was fruitless. This is THE worst experience I've ever had with a specialist: negligent in the extreme!"

But when I visited, it was an incredibly frustrating experience, and I considered filing a complaint with the State of Texas against him. Bottom line, he was completely uninformed about my condition. It is a rare condition, but not so rare that he could excuse being that uninformed about it. Had I not gotten a second opinion, it could have cost me my life. And second, like another reviewer said here, his office absolutely would not release my records so that I could get a second opinion. I must have called over a dozen times in the course of a few weeks and they just kept ""forgetting."" Probably the worst or second worst doctor I have ever had. There are many quality cardiologists in the area; he is not one of them, in my experience.

As for a little extra, he has a good sense of humor. A good man & great doctor."

They would not give me copies of my records for a second optinion. He critizied me for having to plan ahead for someone to stay with me for 2 days after surgery. I had a bad feeling and and Thank God !!! I found a second option. I did not need any further procedure.
228,Dr. Ravinder Agusala,Houston,Texas,Cardiologist, Male,4,3.56,2009-09-30T08:09:39Z,5,5,5,5,5,He is very excellent doctor I never seen in my life.Every doctor will be very hurry.He spends a lot of time with patients.He cleared all our doubts.Very knowledgeble and he will expalin all the reports line by line and tell at what point you have to take care and how you have to take care.We love this doctor.

He was prompt with his office appointments and would take time to answer all of my questions. Staff was likewise punctual and courteous. Highly recommended!
Someone downgraded Dr. Cheng because ""his patients seem to wind up in ICU"". This would seem to be more the result of the patient's medical condition rather than the skill of the doctor."

I find he is personable, professional, and simply stated; knows his stuff. He doesn't waste time or words in defining your treatment. Well versed in med options at lower costs. Highly respected in his field. Yes, punctuality can be a challenge for him at times but one must consider as an attending Physician and Surgeon, he is prone to being more reactive than proactive to his schedule. You can bet if I have an unplanned cardio event, other patients will have to wait a little longer while I receive his excellent treatment. "

He listens well and understood my life style and prescribed medicine accordingly. I play sports hard. To accommodate my situation, Dr Jacobson modified his prescription. Dr Jacobson is very aware of the cost of medicine and prescribed the lower cost one when appropriate.
I don't have puctuality issue. Maybe I have always try to get early morning appointment.

Jacobson that others are criticizing is not the same dr. Jacobson who I have seen. The dr. Jacobson who I have seen is very knowledgeable, professional and thorough. He is extremely busy and does not have time for small talk (although, he will make it if required), however, I have never found him rude and anything less than professional and knowledgeable. For what it is worth, other knowledgeable doctors both recommend and use him personally."

The big issue is his scheduling staff and lack of ability to meet appointments in a timely manner, if at all. On several occasions, I show up for the appointment and he's either not there or up to 2 hours behind. His staff shows little to no concern for our time. Even when I call before leaving for the appointment, his staff still tells me I need to be there on time even though they know he's not in the office and will be way behind when he does arrive. Recently, I asked for someone to call me when he arrived (I'm only 10 minutes from the office) and they told me they didn't have time to call me and said that I should show up for my scheduled appointment anyway and wait. I'm moving on to another office with hopefully a better customer experience."

Only thing is I am waiting to see him in the exam room for over an hour. When was staff going to come and tell me....I finally went out and asked about him, had to reschedule. The second visit he wasn't even in the office with over 10 people waiting in the office ahead of me. The recp. said to "" expect this with Cardiologists. There are a lot of Cardio's in Houston, I don't need to take off work twice and not be seen. If you or I did that we would have to pay the office visit. How do you bill a Dr. for your time?"

I would agree that his bedside manner leaves much to be desired, but he is an extremely knowledgeable doctor and an excellent surgeon. His diagnosis was right on the money every time. He is nearly always late to appointments because he spends countless hours at his office as well as at the hospital with patients, taking the time to answer their questions. He will not waste words with you, so if you aren't prepared to hear the brutal truth, find someone else. After 6 weeks of appointments and tests with other doctors and specialists, he examined my mom for 2 minutes and said she needed to be admitted to hospice. She passed away within 2 weeks. I was grateful that he told us the truth and didn't cause us to waste my mom's precious time, energy, and money."

He was more than thorough. He also found on my husbands stress test a blip which we had checked out. he had 3 arteries blocked and needed 2 stints. I feel he is very knowledgeable and helpful. He is doing all the right things to find out why my heart beat went to 230 BMP that day.

She underwent bypass surgery the next day and she is feeling so much better now. No words can expressed how thankful we are to Dr. Nguyen and his staff for saving my mothers life.

He has been my cardiologist for the past 6 years and I think he is great. I consider my care to be excellent; he is warm, friendly and, in my opinion, very knowledgeable. No complaints here!"
256,Dr. Patrick J. Cook,Houston,Texas,Cardiologist, Male,8,3.15,2015-02-25T12:47:11.025Z,2,2,3,2,1,Dr. Cook takes the my way or the highway approach. I find him to be arrogant and forceful....defensive if you question him about anything. I have researched things he recommends and find him grossly out of touch. I have mentioned things to him over the past few visits over the past 5-years and he basically said the people that I got the information from were crazy and quacks. Amazing how the things I mentioned to him are in fact 100% true and he is 100% wrong. All he wants to do shove statin drugs down your throat. He basically starts writing the prescription as soon as he walk in the exam room. I will never use this doctor again.
257,Dr. Patrick J. Cook,Houston,Texas,Cardiologist, Male,8,3.15,2014-10-01T13:38:42.233Z,3,3,2,3,4,"Dr. Cook's staff is generally helpful until a procedure is required. The recommend using St. Luke's but that hospital isn't the most cost effective by far. They would not make an alternative recommendation to have the procedure done. Blood drawing is acceptable, but bruising is routine as well. Wait times increase the later in the day your appointment is."
258,Dr. Patrick J. Cook,Houston,Texas,Cardiologist, Male,8,3.15,2013-04-15T12:49:32Z,3.3,4,4,2,3,Dr Cook is knowledgeable in his field of invasive medicine but is not willing to consider alternative diagnostic methods put forward by the patient. I found him to be very forceful in his opinions and not very attentive to my concerns. I wish him well in his practice but he was not for me.
259,Dr. Patrick J. Cook,Houston,Texas,Cardiologist, Male,8,3.15,2010-10-04T02:17:58Z,2,3,2,1,2,"Dr. Cook doesn't seem very interested in his patients. I waited in the outer waiting room for 30 minutes, then when I was taken in to the treatment room he was standing by the nurses station gobbling up lunch food provided by drug companies and enjoying himself. I had to wait 20 minutes while he ate and amused himself with the drug salesmen. When he finally got to the treatment room he was not as engaged as he was with the food and drug salesman and I got the feeling he wasn't at all concerned about my heart condition or treatment. He seemed bored and I did not feel I could count on him if I had an emergency so I never went back.I felt he considered it a chore to see me and that is not a good sign!"
260,Dr. Patrick J. Cook,Houston,Texas,Cardiologist, Male,8,3.15,2009-01-06T13:56:11Z,3,3,3,3,3,"He seems attentive,but also seems to form opinions without listening directly to the patient. I also feel like he pushed specific medication on me that may not be needed. i never got a chance to speak to him directly after my initial appointment-the nurse would only talk on his behalf. One of his nurses didn't know how to draw blood and left a really bad bruise but, the location is nice."
261,Dr. Patrick J. Cook,Houston,Texas,Cardiologist, Male,8,3.15,2006-10-21T20:34:09Z,5,,5,5,5,He visited me everyday in the hospital after bypass surgery. He is easy to talk to and seems genuinely concerned.
262,Dr. Patrick J. Cook,Houston,Texas,Cardiologist, Male,8,3.15,2005-07-16T09:00:48Z,2.3,,3,1,3,"He knows his stuff, but overall I don't rate him well with bedside manner. We need Dr's we can talk with. That's very important."
263,Dr. Jose R. SOTO,Houston,Texas,Cardiologist, Male,2,4,2013-10-15T09:31:16Z,3.5,1,3,5,5,Dr. Soto is an excellent doctor but his staff is not. I arrived for my scheduled appointment however Dr. Soto was in surgery. His staff told me I can wait or reschedule my appointment. It would be nice for his staff to call me before my appointment to let me know Dr. Soto would not be there.
264,Dr. Jose R. SOTO,Houston,Texas,Cardiologist, Male,2,4,2011-12-01T06:12:03Z,4.5,3,5,5,5,This cardiologist has saved my life! Dr. Soto was by my side within 5 minutes of my hospital arrival being in the middle of a cardiac arrest. He has continued to be my link to wellness for over seven years.
265,Dr. Marcy L. Lim,Houston,Texas,Cardiologist, Female,1,5,2011-12-14T15:33:57Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Lim gave me my life back. Before I developed any serious medical conditions, Dr. Lim recommended me for weight loss surgery. Dr. Lim was their during the whole process. The other doctors never had a problem getting any information needed from Dr. Lim's office. She is a great doctor."

Dr. Benrey has performed multiple procedures on myself, my brother, and my father. He not only does great work he explains what he is doing and why he is doing it.

I ended up at a pulmonologist trying to find out the cause for my symptoms who ran another echo and immediately diagnosed the problem. Needed open heart surgery by the time it was diagnosed to correct but it could have caused a stroke and had already elevated my pulmonary arterial pressures. Requested medical records from DeFelice's office and saw that he had signed off on the original echo which stated that my pressures were elevated and that there was an atrial septal defect (hole) in my heart. You've been warned and I'm just thankful the cardiologists at DeBakey were able to handle the problem with open heart surgery.

324,Dr. Ping F. Wong,Houston,Texas,Cardiologist, Male,2,3.5,2016-04-29T00:25:20.329Z,2,3,3,1,1,"I saw Dr. Wong three years ago, and was humiliated... He kept telling me that my symptoms (which I've been suffering with for thirteen years now) were ""just stress,"" and actually laughed at me when I started crying out of frustration because he refused to listen to my symptoms. I didn't want to see another doctor regarding my symptoms because of that experience, but when I recently needed to see a doctor for unrelated symptoms, he noticed that my pulse was extremely high. I informed him of what Dr. Wong said, and this doctor said, ""there's no way that stress is causing you to have had palpitations and tachycardia every day for thirteen years,"" and he referred me to another cardiologist. The new cardiologist diagnosed me almost instantly - Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome. This in turn helped lead to the diagnosis of a rare genetic condition called Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome.
No patient deserves to be ridiculed, written off, and invalidated like that. I would never recommend this doctor to anyone.
While I take responsibility for choosing not to get a second opinion more quickly, I shouldn't have been made to feel crazy and unreasonable for having and being concerned about my symptoms. His treatment toward me crushed me, and I sincerely believed that I would never be helped."

It seemed as if she had already diagnosed me before she even met me and blamed my heart palpitations on ""anxiety"" and ""stress."" She was condescending and the appointment was a waste of time. It was also apparent that she did not review my chart thoroughly because she appeared to be unaware of the tests and diagnosis that I had previously received through my primary physician. I was referred to a Cardiologist for a reason, my holter test came back abnormal, so I'm pretty sure I had a legitimate reason for being there and it wasn't because I have an ""anxiety problem."""

After second incident and I continued to have problems, I went for a second opinion at St Luke's. Wow, within the first day, they had answers and could not believe Dr Peabody did not catch the issues and even questioned whether she was really a cardiologist or just a regular physician. Fast forward, three heart surgeries with the most recent being a pacemaker. If you are in the Houston area, go to St Lukes, Dr Willerson. If you are in the Woodlands, go to St Lukes, Dr Sanjay Patel. I could have died had I not went for the second opinion and these were issues she should have caught instead of blaming it on everything else becasue according to her, I was just too young to have anything wrong with my heart. She failed me in a big way I have multiple issues that were congenital but simple things she should have caught"

I was told that I would be told the the results in 7 to 10 days. I wrote a letter to Dr. Nemeth stating I was unhappy with the time frame of the receipt of the results as I thought that this time frame was too long to wait for results. I called after 7 calendar days and left a message for Dr. Nemeth's nurse and received a call back next day with answers to questions poised in the letter but no results and was told that 10 days meant 10 business days. I was tod that the Doctor had not passed on the results but that the nurse would leave a message for Dr Nemeth and she would get back to me when she received the results. I called again at the end of the 10th business day and the call has not been returned indicating that no results are available. The Coronary was a major one and I was not expected to live. The Dr. knew this and how important I placed on the results. This is appalling

As part of an overall cardiac physical evaluation . I was pleased with the overall experience except for one major mistake on his part. After extensive interview and other testing (EKG), he recommends a routine Echocardiogram as a precautionary measure, which would be conveniently performed in his office by his technician that same day. Which I do because he doesn't mention anything about additional fees for testing within an office visit. Afterwards, I get slapped with a $250 charge on top of my $50 co-pay. Needless to say, I was and still am very upset about. Because, as a courtesy he should mention it to his patients that his simple recommendation could cost his patients extra money... Very disappointed. I would not recommend anyone to visit a business that operates like this... Of course, his office staff and their billing dept stated ""it was nothing that they could do"" and it's ultimately my responsibility to know my benefits. Very shady!"

He uses light-hearted humor to ease his patients. Everything seems to be going well until you have the mind to ask questions when you're feeling doubtful. Dr. Nguyen then turns into a completely different person. He becomes insulted that anyone would question anything he has to say and would then begin yelling at you. He will then proceed to speak down to you and belittle you just because you may have some questions concerning yourself that you're feeling unsure of. Believing that he may POSSIBLY be having a bad day, I returned and had the same experience as before. I spoke to other people who I later found out have seen Dr. Nguyen and they all said he had elicited the same behavior BEFORE I had a chance to tell them about my experience.

Dr. Blausteins continued efforts in the fight against Heart Disease are what keep me going. He has the best bed side manner of any other doctor Ive ever met and when youre sick thats important."
