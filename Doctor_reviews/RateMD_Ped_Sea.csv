0,Dr. Gary B. Spector,Seattle,Washington,pediatrician, Male,9,4.33,2014-10-15T04:36:18.390Z,4.5,5,3,5,5,"I've taken both my boys, since birth, to Dr. Spector. Even after relocating an hour away, I don't feel right switching to a different pediatrician (And I've tried two out near our new home when the younger was newborn.) He's a great doctor, very knowledgeable, and honest. Yes, he has a funny sense of humor, though never offensive. He also makes my kids laugh and feel comfortable. His nurse, Amber, is a joy to work with when we visit. Staff is very friendly and fast! I trust him with my boys, and trust he'll listen when I have concerns; and take action when it's needed."
1,Dr. Gary B. Spector,Seattle,Washington, Pediatricians , Male,9,4.33,2014-10-01T18:36:12.663Z,4.8,5,4,5,5,"I have to say my experience as a staff member working with Dr. Spector has been much different. He has been kind, supportive and lots of fun to work with. I can honestly say I have really enjoyed working with him and have never heard him yell or scream at anyone. He is really a great doctor and a great person."
2,Dr. Gary B. Spector,Seattle,Washington, Pediatricians , Male,9,4.33,2013-09-15T16:46:45Z,3.3,3,2,3,5,"Dr.Spector is a great doctor, but not very nice to work for as an employee. He is greedy, selfish, and screams and yells when he doesn't get his way. It was a nightmare working for him needless to say!"
3,Dr. Gary B. Spector,Seattle,Washington, Pediatricians , Male,9,4.33,2012-03-02T00:00:56Z,4.5,4,4,5,5,I have taken my three children to him and have complete confidence in him. My children look forward to seeing him as well
4,Dr. Gary B. Spector,Seattle,Washington, Pediatricians , Male,9,4.33,2008-04-16T23:02:34Z,4.5,4,4,5,5,"I cannot imagine trusting my daughters to anyone else! He is extremely thorough, very comforting, follows up and responsive. My friends all go to him as well and it sounds like a fan club when we get together. Word of warning, however. He used to be a professional standup comedian to pay for school and his jokes are rarely politically correct even though they are hysterical. Besides being an outstanding pediatrician, he is also a cancer specialist. He explained his humor to me once by saying, believe me, I know what is serious and everything else in life is to be enjoyed."
5,Dr. Gary B. Spector,Seattle,Washington, Pediatricians , Male,9,4.33,2008-03-14T00:18:00Z,5,5,5,5,5,"We LOVE Dr. Gary! I drive more than an hour each way to take my kids to him. He is so thorough and knowledgeble about everything. If there is ever a question, he takes every precaution. He has always personally called the next day to check up on the kids after any sickness or injury. He makes himself available at all times and responds so fast if I have questions. We love his humor and candid replies to everything. He is an amazing doctor, we are lucky to have found him!"
6,Dr. Gary B. Spector,Seattle,Washington, Pediatricians , Male,9,4.33,2007-08-03T22:54:44Z,3.5,2,2,5,5,"Dr. Spector was wonderful, terrific, kind, helpful, blunt, and willing to go the extra mile again, again, and again. Far and away the best baby/kid doc any of my kids have ever seen, not only because he's smart and insightful, but because he has heart and is forever an advocate of the child. He does have a quirky sense of humor that took some getting used to, and I could readily imagine that might rub some people the wrong way. Gary Spector is a one-in-a-million doc--a thoroughly decent and good guy and an extraordinary pediatrician."
7,Dr. Gary B. Spector,Seattle,Washington, Pediatricians , Male,9,4.33,2006-09-08T18:42:30Z,4.7,,5,4,5,"Dr. Spector was extremely innapropriate in his comments in front of a 4 year old female patient. While his diagnosis was fine, his judgment was very poor."
8,Dr. Gary B. Spector,Seattle,Washington, Pediatricians , Male,9,4.33,2006-03-29T15:40:47Z,4.7,,4,5,5,"We used Dr. Spector's services from birth thru adulthood. He is extremely knowledgable, professional, thorough, and caring. He really listens to his patients and their parents, and acts accordingly. He is very practical and very dedicated. Every call was returned, and if it needed his personal attention, he was the one that called back. He earned our trust and never failed, in 20 years, to maintain that trust. Thanks SO much Dr. Spector!"
9,Dr. Gloria A. Arand,Seattle,Washington, Pediatricians , Female,3,4.92,2013-09-25T14:05:31Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Arand has been wonderful for all my children. She is knowledgable, kind, and has helped us through some scary medical issues. We have never had to wait longer than five minutes. Great doctor!"
10,Dr. Gloria A. Arand,Seattle,Washington, Pediatricians , Female,3,4.92,2010-03-04T18:48:46Z,4.8,5,4,5,5,"We consider ourselves lucky to have had Dr. Arand as our infant son's doctor. She takes time with our baby, is competent and knowledgeable, and very support of new parents. She is supportive of breastfeeding and helped us tackle breastfeeding issues. Her staff is helpful, friendly, and respectful. When we had urgent concerns the clinic was responsive by phone and if necessary got us a same-day appointment. Our sole complaint is that occasionally wait times in the clinic are longer than we would like. We are sorry to leave her behind because of a move, and heartily recommend Dr. Arand for newborn care."
11,Dr. Gloria A. Arand,Seattle,Washington, Pediatricians , Female,3,4.92,2008-12-31T12:55:24Z,5,5,5,5,5,"The best, very atypical of Seattle's ""elite"". Down to Earth and very caring about children, not time, or status. Dr. Arand is the epitomy of excellence. She is concerned about the care of my children, not her clock, or quotas. It's refreshing to find a ""throwback"" like Dr Arand."
12,Dr. Jessica A. Lichter,Seattle,Washington, Pediatricians , Female,3,4.83,2012-11-29T23:14:16Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Im a international student. the day i lived in the hospital was looked by Dr.Lechter. A very good doctor, who is very kind. Very appreciate her."

14,Dr. Jessica A. Lichter,Seattle,Washington, Pediatricians , Female,3,4.83,2011-04-24T19:43:45Z,5,5,5,5,5,Good doc. I appreciate your kindness and it was a breath of fresh air talking with someone who listens.
15,Dr. Richard K. Gould,Federal Way,Washington, Pediatricians , Male,5,4.82,2012-05-07T10:30:51Z,5,5,5,5,5,"I never have a problem with billing here, but I have at other places. DR Gould is gentle with the children and clearly has the experience behind him. We never second guess his advice. We drive 45 minutes for doctor's appts and wouldn't change it for anything."
16,Dr. Richard K. Gould,Federal Way,Washington, Pediatricians , Male,5,4.82,2008-06-16T23:37:27Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Gould is calm, caring and compassionate. He sees both my son and daughter and not only do I think he is the best but they do too."

My children have seen him since they were born and they absolutely love him. He is thorough and I have never walked out his office feeling uncomfortable.
18,Dr. Richard K. Gould,Federal Way,Washington, Pediatricians , Male,5,4.82,2007-03-31T01:39:12Z,5,,5,5,5,"Dr ""G"" saw my daughter from 1974 to 1989. He is the best damn doctor ever! I only wish I could have found one like him for myself..He's very through & explains everything he does & why he's doing it or what he's looking for...I HIGHLY RECCOMMEND him for ANY first time mother; He will surely put your mind at ease! I""m hoping to take my grandson to see him!! I can't say enough about how wonderful this man & doctor is.Thank GOD is is still practicing medicine.."
19,Dr. Richard K. Gould,Federal Way,Washington, Pediatricians , Male,5,4.82,2006-12-04T15:33:32Z,4.7,,4,5,5,"Dr. Gould has taken care of all my children since birth and has seen everything from prematurity, the affects of Rh incompatibility, a 3 week old with strep throat, heads that need stitches, broken noses, and anything else you can think of. He has always handled each case calmly and explained everything very carefully. He interacts very positively with my children and is careful to answer all of THEIR questions too. He comes highly recommended by every nurse I've talked to (and not just those at his office!) and I add my recommendation as well!"
20,Dr. Andrea M. Fasullo,Seattle,Washington, Pediatricians , Female,4,4.44,2009-09-21T16:18:18Z,3.8,2,3,5,5,"Amazing doctor. She listens and is very knowledgeable. She's always up to date on the latest in the medical field, but does not push things on anyone. She is never condescending, rather she understands that ""Mom knows best"" and goes from there."

23,Dr. Andrea M. Fasullo,Seattle,Washington, Pediatricians , Female,4,4.44,2008-06-09T01:18:29Z,4.8,5,4,5,5,"We have been patients for 8 years. She is excellent! Always listens. No matter how many times we go or don't go she remembers all the kids names (even when they are not with me), medical issues, etc.. Easy to talk to, and my kids LOVE her!!

32,Dr. David W. Buchholz,Seattle,Washington, Pediatricians , Male,5,4.55,2006-11-07T18:40:24Z,2,,3,1,2,"Dr. Buchholz didn't even acknowledge my son when he entered the room. This is the first thing that tipped me off that he may not be very friendly. He then made generalizations and diagnoses based upon little information. I do not recommend Dr. Buchholz if you are a breastfeeding mother, co-sleep or want to be involved in important decisions pertaining to the care of your child."
33,Dr. David W. Buchholz,Seattle,Washington, Pediatricians , Male,5,4.55,2006-08-08T11:50:14Z,5,,5,5,5,"Excellent pediatrician. Extremely smart, and thorough."
34,Dr. David W. Buchholz,Seattle,Washington, Pediatricians , Male,5,4.55,2005-12-06T01:42:42Z,5,,5,5,5,"Dr. B is super smart, and keeps up-to-date on current studies. He plays with my son during examinations so he is distracted and won't cry. He is also very knowledgable about childhood development and behaviors, and always takes his time to answer my questions. The only other thing is that when he is paged at night (we've paged him twice) it takes him a few seconds to wake up... he may be grumpy :) But he gives thorough information and apologizes if he seems grumpy, and that is what matters I think! In his defense... the second time we paged him Andrew just had a cough... my husband made me page him!!!"
35,Dr. Ron L. Kaplan,Seattle,Washington, Pediatricians , Male,3,4,2013-12-06T15:17:56Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Seattle Children's Emergency Department is amazing! Our son had a broken leg and Dr. Kaplan was very attentive to his pain control, and made a very stressful time a positive experience."
36,Dr. Ron L. Kaplan,Seattle,Washington, Pediatricians , Male,3,4,2013-05-08T18:36:36Z,5,5,5,5,5,We have seen Dr. Kaplan in the emergency room twice for seizures. Once my son stopped breathing. Dr. Kaplan responded immediately with great skill. He saved his life!

40,Dr. Rhonda L. Levitt,Seattle,Washington, Pediatricians , Female,3,4.67,2009-07-23T14:43:39Z,5,5,5,5,5,"I cannot recommend Dr. Levitt highly enough. She has provided first-rate care to my 3 children for more than 7 years. She is always patient, engaged, and attentive to my needs and theirs. She has never hesitated to refer my kids to specialists when needed. I have had 4 different specialists at Children's Hospital tell me on 4 separate occasions that they respect her a great deal and that we are lucky to have her caring for our kids. These endorsements were unsolicited. She is knowledgeable and attentive to both medical and developmental issues and all 3 of my kids love her. Oh, and her office will schedule same-day appointments for sick kids without any runaround and when you call with a question about your kid, the doctor returns your call, not a nurse."
41,Dr. Rhonda L. Levitt,Seattle,Washington, Pediatricians , Female,3,4.67,2008-12-29T21:00:52Z,4.5,5,3,5,5,She was my doctor for 18 years and I'm very sad that I have to look for a new doctor because she's always been very helpful and caring. I would highly recommend her.
42,Dr. Rhonda L. Levitt,Seattle,Washington, Pediatricians , Female,3,4.67,2005-06-09T16:28:01Z,4.3,,3,5,5,"Respectful with kids, takes her time answering parents' questions. (Which can sometimes lead to delays.) Once, when I had a medical emergency with my first baby, she was the doctor I happened to see; she was the only medical personnel that I encountered who asked me how I was doing. After that we became her patients. I trust her judgment and like her common-sense approach to child-rearing."
43,Dr. Elisabeth P. Ware,Seattle,Washington, Pediatricians , Female,2,4.63,2012-03-10T18:25:46Z,4.8,5,4,5,5,"Great doctor! Very compassionate, authentic, helpful, thorough and knowledgable. Looking to switch to Dr. Ware for further primary medical care. Thank you."

45,Dr. Jennifer C. Wargula,Seattle,Washington, Pediatricians , Female,3,3.75,2014-10-09T17:39:59.837Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Wragula,
she saved my life when I was 13. I was very sick. The hospital in my area at Jamestown NY, they weren't helpful at all. I was taken to women and children's in buffalo ny. Seen in the ER and they sent me to her office. I would not have made it as far as I have with out her. She is an amazing doctor and unlike others she cares about her patients. Thank you Dr.Wragula! I have been in remission now for 5 years and I am now going on 25 years old. :)"
46,Dr. Jennifer C. Wargula,Seattle,Washington, Pediatricians , Female,3,3.75,2011-07-10T10:51:45Z,3.8,3,3,5,4,"I found Dr. Wargula to be very warm and caring, and she developed a great rapport with my child. While she doesn't always run on time, she spends the entire time talking and learning about what has been going on with my child since her las visit - which I appreciate! Many times I feel that she goes the extra mile to find answers and do what she thinks is in the best interest of her patients."
47,Dr. Jennifer C. Wargula,Seattle,Washington, Pediatricians , Female,3,3.75,2009-03-13T01:14:56Z,2.5,3,4,1,2,"I took my teen daughter to her to have her evaluated by Dr. Wargula when she was doing her fellowship. Once she starting interacting with my daughter I was surprised that she was in pediatrics. She displayed little ability to empathize and deal with young people, or people in general for that matter. I also observed tht she jumped quickly to conclusions with few inquiries and review of information. Perhaps she has improved since that time - I hope so for the sake of the children she cares for."
48,Dr. Jenny W. Pang,Seattle,Washington, Pediatricians , Female,3,3.67,2017-10-27T05:33:34.560Z,5,5,5,5,5,"She is amazing!!!!!!!! Go to Ms.Pang. She is so friendly and educated. Very happy with her. Her punctuality is on point. If she is ever late, it is usually a scheduling error on behalf of the secretaries. You need to see her."

58,Dr. Jonathan R. Fox,Federal Way,Washington, Pediatricians , Male,1,5,2012-03-22T00:51:26Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Dr. Fox is awesome. Two of my daughters go to see him. A third one used to, but she is now an adult so no more pediatrians for her! :-) Dr. Fox is incredibly patient and kind. He takes so much time listening to my kids. He explains everything in a way they can understand. He is positive and supportive, and has the best bedside manner. We are very blessed to have him as our pediatrian. His nurses are as good as he is! Really a delightful group of people!"

62,Dr. Laurie S. Fouser,Seattle,Washington, Pediatricians , Female,1,5,2012-06-29T21:46:14Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Not only is Dr. Fouser an expert in her field, she is wonderfully caring and personal. I'm sure the only reason I had to wait a bit in the waiting room is because she was doing a thorough and personal job seeing her patients before us. She takes the time to see the patient as a whole person. She wants to know what else is going on in their lives because some of it might affect their diagnosis or treatment. I recommend Dr. Fouser whole-heartedly. Lot's of people rate doctors when they are unhappy. It takes a little extra effort to rate them when they are happy with with their experience. I am taking the time to give great feedback because she is terrific!"
63,Dr. Jeffery A. Wright,Seattle,Washington, Pediatricians , Male,1,5,2008-12-13T09:26:05Z,5,5,5,5,5,"Amazing doctor. My husband loves the fact/research based way he addresses our daughters growth, development and any illnesses she may be experiencing - his depth of knowledge is both vast and reassuring and I love his great attitude and sense of humor. The staff is so nice and always remembers us by name. Scheduling is super easy and you're never searching around for a parking spot! We love Jeff and the clinic!"
64,Dr. Timothy J. Brei,Seattle,Washington, Pediatricians , Male,1,5,2012-03-06T19:19:38Z,5,5,5,5,5,"He had a feeding test scheduled for my son. He was very accurate at knowing what to do since my son failed his feeding test. He immediately had my son admitted to impatient and had treatment started. He started with an NG tube (through the nose to the stomach) then went with the surgical G-tube (a small tube in the stomach). I may have to feed him differently now, but he is doing a lot better than before the feeding test. He is a lot healthier and happier. His team that helped out was GREAT with my son. They showed they cared and showed a lot of concern for us. Riley Hospital is where this doctor works at (Indianapolis, Indiana) and it is the best hospital I've been to ever for kids with special needs. I would recommend this doctor to anyone who needs him."

70,Dr. Christine Caldwell,Seattle,Washington, Pediatricians , Female,1,4.75,2010-09-30T22:15:48Z,4.8,4,5,5,5,"I have 3 children and we have been going to Dr. Caldwell for over 9 years. She always takes the time to listen to us in appointments and offer advice. One of the things I like most is that she respects the child and speaks to them even at young ages. She involves the parents (of course) but letting a five year old talk about their accomplishments helps take some of the drama out of the dr visits. Dr. Caldwell is honest and always provides valuable feedback. The medical assistants are absolutely fabulous! Working with kids can be tough...especially when giving shots, but they have the patience, humor and kindness of saints. Well done on your hiring - keep it up!"
71,Dr. Thomas E. Numrych,Seattle,Washington, Pediatricians , Male,1,4.75,2010-01-07T22:25:47Z,4.8,4,5,5,5,He is the best pediatrician that we have been with. He is caring and also was voted one of Seattle's Top Doctors by Seattle Magazine in 2009. Any concerns that we have he listens and follows up. He doesn't rush us at all. Most of the staff is nice but his male medical assistant can be in a rush sometimes.
72,Dr. John C. Carter,Seattle,Washington, Pediatricians , Male,1,4.5,2012-01-05T17:57:28Z,4.5,4,4,5,5,Dr. Carter was absolutely great with my daughter! He is her favorite doctor and really helped during a tough illness.
73,Dr. Catherine Delostrinos,Seattle,Washington, Pediatricians , Female,1,4.5,2013-04-17T01:57:50Z,4.5,3,5,5,5,"Love her. Very thorough, attentive, caring, and good. My Girls love her. We were seeing another pediatrician and he was mediocre. Dr. Cat listens to all of your concerns and give you feedbacks on all of them. Doesnt rush you, even if you were a last minute pt, but her nurses will (depends on who u get). My husband likes her and he did not care for the girls previous MD."
74,Dr. Matthew W. Allen,Seattle,Washington, Pediatricians , Male,1,4.5,2007-08-23T11:28:52Z,4.5,4,4,5,5,"Dr. Allen is a fantastic pediatrician. He listens very well to your questions, then takes the time to explain exactly what is normal and when you should be concerned. We moved out of the immediate area, but continue to see Dr. Allen because we wouldn't want to switch doctors!"
75,Dr. Timothy R. Hall,Seattle,Washington, Pediatricians , Male,2,3.38,2015-05-11T05:51:10.797Z,4.5,4,4,5,5,"Dr Hall has been great and very caring for both our kids (3&1). Also, follows up to make sure they are feeling better when they were really sick. Gives good advice based in scientific fact and experience. "
76,Dr. Timothy R. Hall,Seattle,Washington, Pediatricians , Male,2,3.38,2010-10-19T09:46:59Z,2.3,3,4,1,1,He made the wrong wrong diagnosis twice on my child.

This makes me and our kids very sad as we have seen her for4 years but for the last 2 years now they have lost appointments that we set up months in advance or canceled critical appointments to reschedule 3-6 months later (with new born weight, vaccine checkups, or timed needs for care can be a bigger deal then they care to realize/acknowlegde). If it was a first time offence or even a second time it could be overlooked but not with almost every single appointment the past two years. Again, Dr. Seru is wonderful but the chances of actually seeing her (at least with anything to do with the front desk staff) is iffy at best. "
79,Dr. Samuel Zinner,Seattle,Washington, Pediatricians , Male,2,2.38,2014-03-19T13:10:39Z,2.8,4,4,1,2,"1st visit, we though we got the best doctor. Well documenting on everything, communication well. However, the following 3 visits were all terrible. Blaming parents not following tiny details without discussing the true problem. One example, we stopped record all details after our baby became stable; he then said your parents should document everything... blah blah, again and again. We have four kids to raise; how can we do this?! Another thing is important medical issue is never discussed, he would say it's not in MY FIELD, he always says I can refer you to a phycical-checkup.. etc. Not helpful at all. Purely wasting time on him, worthless."
80,Dr. Samuel Zinner,Seattle,Washington, Pediatricians , Male,2,2.38,2012-11-29T16:36:33Z,2,3,3,1,1,"My son (almost 4 and cannot speak intelligibly) has been seen by Dr. Zinner about a month ago. After two sessions with him he gave a diagnostic of ""unspecified neurological disorder"". This will truly help my son since now we will be able to provide him with unspecified therapy or unspecified drugs."

I'm in customer Service and have never seen a doctor do that before. She hung up on me. If she doesn't have patience to talk with respect to clients and their parents then I would recommend she not to on call/after hours support
82,Dr. Robin D. Ifft,Seattle,Washington, Pediatricians , Female,2,2.25,2010-08-09T18:34:37Z,2.8,2,5,2,2,"My daughter presented with lateral foot pain. She's 11 years old and is perfectly capable of pin-pointing the exact location of her pain; which she did. The doctor keep making references to the facial expressions on my daughter's face as a method of identify the location of her pain. The doctor ordered x-ray's of her ankle, missing all the bones of her foot. A really bad experience; a waste of time, and money."
83,Dr. Senait Y. Abraham,Seattle,Washington, Pediatricians , Female,1,2.75,2011-11-02T08:55:30Z,2.8,2,3,3,3,"Dr Abraham's staff was ok, sometimes poor at communicating in english. All of her staff seems to be first language spanish...but she is first language something else all together. She didn't study in the US and her communication skills are ok at best, she didn't understand everything I was saying. She wasn't terrible, but I wasn't super happy and I have three children, so I visit a lot. I felt like I was inconveniencing the staff and Dr Abraham bringing all of my kids (and we often had to wait, no one was prompt or early) and no one really offered to help make our visit better. There are no rooms in the office that accommodate what seems more than one parent/one child together. They do give each child a book with each visit, which is nice."
84,Dr. Jonah B. Essers,Seattle,Washington, Pediatricians , Male,2,1.88,2015-08-19T05:09:30.664Z,1,1,1,1,1,"Our experience with Dr Essers was terrible. He looks confident but in reality he is clueless. After going through unnecessary invasive procedure, which we will regret forever, we found an experienced doctor in another hospital. We are on our way to recovery now. Don't waste your time and money by going to Dr Essers."
85,Dr. Jonah B. Essers,Seattle,Washington, Pediatricians , Male,2,1.88,2013-03-29T13:36:23Z,2.8,4,4,1,2,"I found Dr. Essers to be dismissive and too caught up in the science of medicine to care about practical matters such as cost. He did not assist in identifying approaches that were affordable and easy to apply, rather he suggested the ""highest yield"" test that was invasive and cost thousands. I had to take my teen back to a primary care doctor to get a reasonable approach and solution to his chronic GI issues. Do not waste your time and money on this doctor."
86,Dr. Cora C. Breuner,Seattle,Washington, Pediatricians , Female,1,2,2013-05-25T22:58:01Z,2,5,1,1,1,I saw Dr. Bruner almost 10 years ago for a an eating dissorder. She did nothing for me. Every time I would not get better she would up my meds. Little did she know I was not taking them. 5 years after I stopped seeing her I gained my health back. She saw me about 5 minutes each visit. I hope she is a better Dr. now
87,Dr. Mark A. Del Beccaro,Seattle,Washington, Pediatricians , Male,1,1.75,2013-05-01T17:43:42Z,1.8,2,3,1,1,"after a long ER wait, a resident and then Dr. Del Beccaro both misrecorded rx. info about our daughter. this led to a problem with her treatment: linked back to the erroneous history. we were clear and even went over it. a lack of listening, a lack of rigor in record-keeping. very disappointed with this visit."
88,Dr. Yemiserach Kifle,Seattle,Washington, Pediatricians , Female,1,1.75,2011-03-26T16:49:54Z,1.8,4,1,1,1,Dr. Kifle dismissed our child's central sleep apnea saying she hoped she might grow out of it and we should do sleep training so we parents could get more sleep. Three subsequent doctors were very concerned for our child who stops breathing multiple times a night. We are now persuing treatment options.
89,Dr. Ourania B. Malliris,Seattle,Washington, Pediatricians , Female,2,1.5,2014-08-11T01:39:56.087Z,1,1,1,1,1,"When I was ten, I was experiencing stomach aches due to stress. My parents brought me in, and Malliris said I was fine and that there was nothing to be done. More than a decade later and my anxiety prevents me from eating and sleeping and working. I wanted to ask for help so much earlier than this but Malliris told me when I was little that the way I was feeling is just the way life is. She is a terrible doctor. Any doctor who sees that level of anxiety in a child and says that it doesn't matter should have their license revoked. DO NOT send your daughters to Malliris if you want them to stay happy and healthy."
90,Dr. Ourania B. Malliris,Seattle,Washington, Pediatricians , Female,2,1.5,2013-08-07T17:02:17Z,2,2,2,2,2,"Dr. Malliris told me I was fat when I was eight years old. (I was at the top of the normal range). Combine that with the thousands of other negative body messages thrown at young girls, and you've got the set up for awful eating problems and various mental health issues for decades!"
91,Dr. Abigail R. Grant,Seattle,Washington, Pediatricians , Female,1,1,2016-03-05T22:44:27.882Z,1,1,1,1,1,She is terribly unprofessional and needs more training.
92,Dr. Alexandra M. Windhorn,Seattle,Washington, Pediatricians , Female,1,1,2018-01-11T23:57:55.371Z,1,1,1,1,1,"Do not have your child see this doctor. I made the mistake of trying this physician and I regretted it immediately. My child had a fever for about a week, a high grade fever (up to 105 F), so I made an appointment knowing that it was time. This physician saw her and a nasal swab was done. I've preformed nasal swabs many times and I have never seen what happened to my daughter before. My daughter came home with a bloody nose for over an hour and a large red scratch under her nose. I have never in my life heard of one being done so roughly. This immediately made me concerned. The next warning was that this physician sent her home with no treatment but said she wanted us to come back in two days to check her out further for bacterial infection if the fever persisted. In my experience if a small child has a high fever for seven days, you need to look for bacterial infection at this point even if it started viral. This however was not done and of course the fever persisted. In fact it's gotten higher. We then call in thinking at this point this physician is actually going to do her job and treat a very very sick four year old but no she refuses and tells us to make an appointment to do what, maybe actually treat her now? The only reason I can think that this doctor would like to torture small child would be that she gets two reimbursements from the insurance company. I of course will see a different doctor that will not be negligent in nature as Dr. Windhorn Shaver has been. I'm horrified at this physicians actions and will tell everyone I meet and know not to see her or trust her with your child. I can only assume that the whole ""first do no harm"" statement was missed during this physician's oaths. "
93,Dr. Kym R. Ahrens,Seattle,Washington, Pediatricians , Female,1,1,2018-08-02T23:46:45.243Z,1,1,1,1,1,"I had her a few years ago. She’s a complete two-faced b*tch who smiled all pleasantly to my face, then said nasty things about me to my parents. She was so unhelpful and terrible that I actually recovered by forcing myself to get better on my own so that I wouldn’t have to see her! Don’t waste your health insurance premiums on this c*nt."
